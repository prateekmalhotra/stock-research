## **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The LVS business engine is the growth and cash generation from its two Asian integrated resort markets: Macao (Sands China) and Singapore (Marina Bay Sands - MBS).

### **2.1. 2025 Revenue Base Calculation (Conservative)**

*   **9M 2025 Net Revenue:** \$9.37 Billion (from Q1, Q2, Q3 2025 filings)
    *   Q1 2025: \$2.86B
    *   Q2 2025: \$3.18B
    *   Q3 2025: \$3.33B
*   **Projected Q4 2025 Revenue:** Assumed to be at least equal to Q3 2025 (\$3.33B), given management's expectation of "additional share gains and EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter" in Macao.
*   **Estimated 2025 Total Revenue:** \$9.37 Billion + \$3.33 Billion = **\$12.70 Billion**

### **2.2. Revenue Growth Assumptions (2026 - 2030)**

The projections are based on segment-specific drivers and management commentary, applying a conservative approach.

| Year | Macao Growth Rate | Singapore (MBS) Growth Rate | Consolidated Revenue (USD Billions) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | N/A (Base Year) | N/A (Base Year) | **\$12.70** | Based on 9M actuals and conservative Q4 projection. |
| **2026** | **+10.0%** | **+5.0%** | **\$13.88** | *Macao:* Londoner full-ramp/first full year of new competitive strategy (mass market share up to 25.4% in Q3 2025), Macao GGR expected to "exceed \$30 billion in 2025 and continue to grow." *MBS:* Easily exceeding \$2.5B annual EBITDA, showing robust, high-margin, mature growth. |
| **2027** | **+8.0%** | **+4.0%** | **\$14.99** | Macao continues to benefit from market recovery and share gains, moderating slightly. MBS maintains steady growth as Phase 2 of expansion starts to be felt, but not yet complete. |
| **2028** | **+5.0%** | **+4.0%** | **\$16.03** | Assumed normalization of Macao growth as market share stabilizes. MBS maintains steady growth. |
| **2029** | **+4.0%** | **+10.0%** | **\$17.65** | *Macao:* Long-term market growth rate. *MBS:* **Significant bump** expected as the \$8.0 Billion expansion project is assumed to be substantially complete and begins ramping up operations. |
| **2030** | **+3.0%** | **+7.0%** | **\$18.89** | MBS continues its post-expansion ramp. Macao growth normalizes to a conservative, mature market rate. |

## **3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections (2025 - 2030)**

### **3.1. Margin and Tax Assumptions**

*   **Net Income Margin:** Q3 2025 Net Income of \$491M on Revenue of \$3.33B implies a **14.74% Net Income Margin**. Given management's focus on profitability (MBS's 51.7% EBITDA margin and the high-margin nature of mass market focus), a long-term Net Income Margin of **15.0%** is a conservative but reasonable assumption.
*   **Effective Tax Rate (ETR):** I will use a conservative long-term ETR of **17.0%**, as the Singapore operation (which has a 17% statutory rate) is the dominant and most profitable cash flow generator.

### **3.2. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

*   **ROIC Rationale:** The latest twelve months (LTM) ROIC is around 12.7% - 13.97%, demonstrating the company's high-quality asset base.
*   **Conservative ROIC Used:** I will use a **conservative 10.0%** for the reinvestment of retained Net Income (cash), which is below the recent LTM figure but reflects the conservative rule of the valuation and the ongoing large CapEx for MBS expansion.

### **3.3. Net Income Projection Table**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income (B) (A x 15.0%) | Retained Cash from Previous Year (C) | ROIC Income (D) (C x 10.0%) | Net Income for DCF (B + D) (USD Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$12.70 | **\$1.91** | N/A | N/A | **\$1.91** |
| **2026** | \$13.88 | \$2.08 | \$1.91 | \$0.191 | **\$2.27** |
| **2027** | \$14.99 | \$2.25 | \$4.18 | \$0.418 | **\$2.67** |
| **2028** | \$16.03 | \$2.40 | \$6.85 | \$0.685 | **\$3.09** |
| **2029** | \$17.65 | \$2.65 | \$9.94 | \$0.994 | **\$3.64** |
| **2030** | \$18.89 | \$2.83 | \$13.58 | \$1.358 | **\$4.19** |

*Note: Retained Cash for the subsequent year is the cumulative Net Income for DCF. For example, 2027 Retained Cash is \$1.91B + \$2.27B = \$4.18B. Net income for the next year = Net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

## **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The Net Income for DCF is used as the projected Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

### **4.1. Discount Rate and Maturity Rate Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative rate of **10.0%** is used (slightly above the cited WACC of 9.66% to be cautious).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative rate of **2.0%** is used. This is a cautious long-term growth assumption, below the expected GGR growth rate, to reflect the maturity of the Asian gaming market beyond the projection period.

### **4.2. NPV Calculation**

The Net Present Value (NPV) is the sum of the present value of the explicit forecast period (2025-2030) and the Terminal Value (TV).

| Year | FCFE (Net Income for DCF) (USD Billions) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^n) | Present Value (PV) (USD Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1.91 | 0.9091 | \$1.74 |
| **2026** | \$2.27 | 0.8264 | \$1.88 |
| **2027** | \$2.67 | 0.7513 | \$2.01 |
| **2028** | \$3.09 | 0.6830 | \$2.11 |
| **2029** | \$3.64 | 0.6209 | \$2.26 |
| **2030** | \$4.19 | 0.5645 | \$2.37 |
| **Sum of PV (Explicit Period)** | **\$12.37** | | |

### **4.3. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the 2030 FCFE:

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$4.19 \text{B} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$4.27 \text{B}}{0.08} = \$53.375 \text{ Billion}
$$

$$
\text{PV of TV} = \text{TV}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$53.375 \text{B} \times 0.5645 = **\$30.13 \text{ Billion}**
$$

### **4.4. Total Enterprise Value (TEV) and Equity Value**

$$
\text{Total Enterprise Value (TEV)} = \text{Sum of PV (Explicit Period)} + \text{PV of Terminal Value}
$$

$$
\text{TEV} = \$12.37 \text{B} + \$30.13 \text{B} = **\$42.50 \text{ Billion}**
$$

$$
\text{Equity Value} = \text{TEV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Equity Value} = \$42.50 \text{B} + \$3.35 \text{B} - \$15.63 \text{B} = **\$30.22 \text{ Billion}**
$$

## **5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification**

### **Fair Value Per Share**

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$30,220,000,000}{676,134,487} = **\$44.69 \text{ per share}**
$$

---

## **Final Valuation Summary**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$44.69** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **\$57.60** |
| **Difference (Undervalued/Overvalued)** | **28.9% Overvalued by Market** |

### **Justification for the Difference**

The calculated fair value of **\$44.69** is lower than the current market price of **\$57.60**, suggesting that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about LVS's future.

1.  **Market Assumes a Faster/Higher Macao Recovery and Share Gain:**
    *   Our model is conservative: it assumes an average of 6.2% annual revenue growth for Macao (Sands China) from 2025-2030, which may be too slow if the market recovers to pre-COVID levels faster and LVS's new competitive strategy is highly successful. The market may be projecting GGR to not just "exceed \$30 billion" but climb much higher, with LVS's mass market share continuing to rise past the 25.4% achieved in Q3 2025.
2.  **Market is Pricing in the MBS Expansion Sooner and with Higher ROIC:**
    *   Our model applies a major revenue bump from the \$8.0 billion MBS expansion only in 2029 and uses a conservative long-term ROIC of **10.0%**.
    *   The market may be anticipating the new rooms and non-gaming assets from the expansion to come online and generate cash flow (and a return) sooner (e.g., in 2027-2028). Furthermore, the market might be applying a higher long-term ROIC (closer to the most recent LTM figure of 12.7%-13.97%) on the large capital investment, which would significantly boost the Terminal Value.
3.  **Terminal Growth Rate and Discount Rate:**
    *   The model uses a very conservative Terminal Growth Rate of **2.0%** and a conservative Discount Rate of **10.0%**. A slight adjustment, such as a **2.5%** Terminal Growth Rate and a **9.0%** Discount Rate (closer to the cited 9.66% WACC), would dramatically increase the fair value, potentially closing the gap to the market price. The market appears to be using a lower cost of capital and/or higher long-term growth assumptions for a company with such dominant assets.

**Conclusion:** Our conservative business engine (slower revenue ramp for the MBS expansion, cautious Macao growth), conservative Net Income Margin, and conservative DCF parameters (higher discount rate, lower terminal growth) result in a lower fair value. The market is likely pricing in a more aggressive and successful execution of the MBS expansion, faster Macao market recovery, and a higher long-term cash flow growth rate.
