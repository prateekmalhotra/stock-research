## Business Summary

Las Vegas Sands Corp. operates large-scale integrated resorts, primarily in Macau and Singapore. Their core business model revolves around attracting a diverse customer base, including high-spending individuals from mainland China, as well as tourists and convention attendees from across Asia and North America. The majority of their revenue comes from casino gaming operations, with additional income generated from hotel stays, dining, retail, and convention and exhibition services. They essentially create a destination where people can gamble, stay, shop, and attend events, making money from the spending across all these different areas.

## Business Model Risk

A key near-term risk is the impact of geopolitical tensions and travel restrictions, particularly related to China, which can significantly reduce visitor numbers and revenue, as seen during past outbreaks and political shifts. Long-term risks include increased competition from other integrated resorts in Asia and the potential for regulatory changes in gaming laws and taxation in the regions where they operate, which could affect profitability. Economic downturns in key markets could also reduce discretionary spending on gambling and luxury amenities. Furthermore, shifts in consumer preferences away from traditional casino gaming towards other forms of entertainment or digital gambling could pose a threat.

## Company History

Here's a history of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS), from its inception to the present day:

### **Inception and Founding Vision**

*   **Early Beginnings:** The story of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) begins with Sheldon G. Adelson. In 1989, Adelson and his partners purchased the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Prior to this, Adelson had a successful career in the computer trade show business, having founded COMDEX in 1979.
*   **The Integrated Resort Concept:** Adelson's vision was to create an "integrated resort" – a destination that combined not just gaming and hotels, but also world-class convention facilities, entertainment, and retail under one roof. This was a departure from the traditional casino model. The Sands Expo and Convention Center, which opened in 1990, was a testament to this vision, becoming the largest privately owned convention facility in the world at that time.
*   **From Sands to The Venetian:** The original Sands Hotel was eventually demolished to make way for a new, ambitious project. Inspired by a honeymoon trip to Venice, Adelson envisioned The Venetian Las Vegas, a themed resort designed to embody the romance of Venice with the luxury and excitement of Las Vegas. The Venetian opened in 1999, and its success solidified the integrated resort model and laid the groundwork for the company's future.
*   **Formal Establishment:** Las Vegas Sands, Inc. went public in 2004, and its name was changed to Las Vegas Sands Corp.. This marked its official establishment as a major publicly traded company.

### **Growth and Expansion**

*   **Asian Expansion:** Recognizing the vast potential in Asian markets, LVS was one of the first companies to secure a casino operating concession in Macau. Sands Macao opened in 2004, marking the company's first foray into Asia and becoming Macau's first American-operated casino. This was followed by the opening of The Venetian Macao in 2007, which was at the time the largest inhabited building in the world. Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, a globally recognized landmark, opened in 2010 and significantly boosted Singapore's tourism and economy.
*   **Diversification of Offerings:** LVS continued to expand its portfolio with properties like The Palazzo in Las Vegas (opened in 2007) and other resorts in Macau, such as The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao. The company's strategy focused on creating a "city under one roof" experience, offering a comprehensive blend of luxury hotels, casinos, world-class dining, entertainment, and extensive convention spaces.

### **Challenges Faced and Innovative Solutions**

*   **Regulatory Scrutiny and Legal Issues:** LVS has faced regulatory challenges and legal disputes throughout its history. In 2013, the company disclosed potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) related to payments made in China and Macau. While the company disputed some reports, it ultimately agreed to pay penalties to resolve investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice. This led to enhanced internal controls and compliance measures.
*   **Market Volatility and Economic Downturns:** The company's performance has been significantly impacted by economic conditions, particularly in its key markets of Macau and Singapore. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected revenue and led to financial losses. In response, LVS has focused on cost management, operational efficiency, and strategic investments in its core markets.
*   **Sale of Las Vegas Properties:** In a significant strategic shift, LVS announced the sale of its Las Vegas properties in March 2021, with the sale finalized in February 2022. This move allowed the company to focus its capital and resources on its Asian operations and future growth in emerging markets.

### **Tailwinds and Headwinds**

*   **Tailwinds:**
    *   **Growth of Asian Markets:** The rapid economic growth and increasing middle class in Asia, particularly in Macau and Singapore, have been major tailwinds for LVS. The company was well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for integrated resort experiences in these regions.
    *   **The Integrated Resort Model:** Adelson's innovative concept of the integrated resort proved highly successful, attracting both leisure and business travelers and creating diverse revenue streams.
    *   **Strong MICE Segment:** The robust Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) business has been a significant driver of demand and revenue, especially for its convention facilities.
*   **Headwinds:**
    *   **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The global pandemic led to widespread travel restrictions and a dramatic decline in tourism, severely impacting LVS's revenue and profitability.
    *   **Regulatory Changes and Geopolitical Factors:** Changes in government regulations, particularly in Macau, and broader geopolitical tensions between the US and China have presented challenges.
    *   **Competition:** The global hospitality and gaming industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share.
    *   **Economic Slowdowns:** Economic downturns in key markets can lead to reduced consumer spending on discretionary items like travel and entertainment.

### **Present Day and Future Outlook**

*   **Focus on Asia:** Las Vegas Sands Corp. is now primarily focused on its operations in Asia, with significant investments in Macau and Singapore. The company is undertaking substantial expansions, such as the $8 billion expansion of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, projected to add over $1 billion in annual EBITDA by 2032.
*   **Commitment to Sustainability and Social Responsibility:** LVS emphasizes its commitment to sustainability through its Sands ECO360° program and focuses on positive impacts on people, communities, and the planet.
*   **Financial Performance:** The company has shown resilience and recovery, with strong revenue and EBITDA growth reported in recent quarters, particularly driven by its Singapore and Macau operations. LVS continues to invest in its properties and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.
*   **Vision and Mission:** LVS's mission is to "develop and operate iconic integrated resorts that drive business and leisure tourism through sustainable business practices". Its vision is to be the undisputed leader in the integrated resort industry, creating unparalleled guest experiences and driving economic impact.

In essence, Las Vegas Sands Corp. has evolved from a single hotel acquisition into a global leader in integrated resorts, driven by a visionary founder and a strategic focus on developing unique, large-scale destinations that cater to both leisure and business travelers. Despite facing significant challenges, the company has demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt, innovate, and maintain its position as a dominant force in the international hospitality and gaming industry.

## Moat Analysis

Here's an analysis of Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s (LVS) moat:

### Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) Moat Analysis

**1. Integrated Resort Dominance and Market Focus:**
Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has built its moat around developing and operating large-scale, "integrated resorts." These are not just casinos; they combine accommodation, gaming, retail, dining, entertainment, and significant convention and exhibition facilities. This integrated approach allows them to cater to a broader range of customers, from high-stakes gamblers to business travelers and tourists seeking a comprehensive experience. Their strategic focus on key Asian markets, particularly Macau and Singapore, has been a primary driver of their success.

**2. Unique MICE Business Model:**
A significant differentiator for LVS is their emphasis on the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) segment. By offering expansive convention and exhibition spaces, they attract major international events and business tourism, which drives substantial non-gaming revenue. This MICE focus diversifies their income streams, reducing reliance on the more volatile gaming revenue and creating a sticky customer base that requires extensive facilities and services.

**3. Strong Brand Equity and Premium Positioning:**
LVS properties are globally recognized for their luxury, high-quality entertainment, and premium service levels. This strong brand equity, built over years of consistent delivery of high-end experiences, attracts a global clientele, especially in the luxury and high-roller segments. This premium positioning allows for potential pricing power, as customers are willing to pay for the unique, high-quality experience offered.

**4. First-Mover Advantage and Market Penetration:**
LVS was an early entrant in key Asian markets like Macau and Singapore, establishing a strong presence before many competitors. This first-mover advantage allowed them to secure prime locations and build iconic properties, creating a significant barrier to entry for new players. Their deep understanding of these markets and established relationships with local governments have also been crucial.

**5. Customer Loyalty and Recurring Revenue:**
The "Sands Rewards" program and the nature of integrated resorts foster customer loyalty and recurring business. By offering points and benefits for shopping, dining, hotel stays, and gaming, LVS incentivizes repeat visits. The MICE segment also generates recurring business through repeated hosting of conferences and events. Customers who have a positive experience and benefit from loyalty programs are less likely to switch to competitors.

**6. Investment in Infrastructure and Continuous Improvement:**
LVS invests significantly in its properties, not just for initial development but also for ongoing renovations and expansions. For example, they have undertaken extensive renovations in Macau and are investing billions in Singapore for new properties and expansions. This commitment to maintaining and enhancing their offerings ensures they remain competitive and attractive to their target markets.

**7. Investment in Research and Development (R&D):**
While not always highlighted in the same way as tech companies, LVS does invest in R&D and innovation, particularly in areas like sustainability (Sands ECO360) and technology to enhance guest experiences. They also foster innovation through initiatives like the "Sands Innovation Challenge" in Macau. Their R&D spending has been steadily increasing, indicating a commitment to evolving their offerings.

**8. Resilience and Adaptability:**
LVS has demonstrated resilience by navigating significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory shifts. Their strategic decision to divest Las Vegas assets allowed them to refocus and reinvest heavily in their Asian operations, which have shown a strong recovery. This adaptability is key to maintaining their competitive edge in dynamic global markets.

**How easily can it be displaced by someone with more capital?**
While capital is always a factor, LVS's moat is not solely based on financial resources. Their established brand, prime locations, unique MICE business model, and deep market knowledge in Asia create significant barriers. New entrants would need not only substantial capital but also a similar understanding of local regulations and customer preferences, and the ability to build world-class integrated resorts that can compete with LVS's scale and quality.

**Are the customers/contracts sticky and recurring or just one time?**
Customers and contracts tend to be sticky and recurring due to:
*   **Loyalty Programs:** Sands Rewards encourages repeat business across various spending categories.
*   **MICE Segment:** Repeat bookings for conferences and events create recurring revenue streams.
*   **Integrated Experience:** The comprehensive offerings of an integrated resort encourage guests to spend more time and money on-site, increasing the likelihood of return visits.

**What has the company done in the past / is doing now to ensure a solid moat?**
*   **Strategic Market Focus:** Concentrating on high-growth Asian markets like Macau and Singapore.
*   **Investment in Iconic Properties:** Developing and maintaining world-class, large-scale integrated resorts.
*   **Diversification:** Strong emphasis on non-gaming revenue streams, particularly MICE.
*   **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Implementing and enhancing reward programs to retain customers.
*   **Continuous Investment:** Renovating and expanding properties to stay ahead of the competition.
*   **Sustainability Initiatives:** Sands ECO360 demonstrates a commitment to responsible operations, which can enhance brand image and appeal.
*   **Talent Development:** Investing in employees to ensure high service standards.

**Network effects and other advantages:**
*   **Scale and Scope:** The sheer size and integrated nature of their resorts create a self-reinforcing ecosystem where more amenities attract more visitors, who then utilize more amenities.
*   **Brand Reputation:** A strong, globally recognized brand reduces perceived risk for customers and partners.
*   **Government Relations:** Established relationships with governments in their operating regions can lead to favorable regulatory outcomes and licensing.

**Does it invest a lot in R&D? Does it have to constantly innovate?**
LVS does invest in R&D, with R&D expenses showing a consistent increase. While they may not invest as heavily as a tech company, innovation is crucial in the hospitality and entertainment sector. They need to constantly innovate their offerings, guest experiences, and operational efficiencies to maintain their leadership position and appeal to evolving customer preferences. This includes innovations in sustainability, technology, and the development of unique entertainment and dining options.

### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Strong Earnings Performance and Positive Guidance:**
    Las Vegas Sands has recently demonstrated strong financial results, exceeding analysts' expectations for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue in Q2 2025. Management has indicated that strategic initiatives in Macau and Singapore are yielding significant returns. The company has also announced substantial stock repurchases and dividend payments, signaling confidence in its financial health and commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

2.  **Continued Growth in Asian Markets (Macau and Singapore):**
    Las Vegas Sands generates all its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from its Asian operations. The company's Q2 2025 results showed robust performance in both Macau and Singapore, with Marina Bay Sands in Singapore having a "historic quarter" and Macau's Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) accelerating. Management is focused on driving revenue and cash flow growth in these regions, aiming to increase market share and EBITDA. The ongoing recovery and growth in these key markets, supported by strong product offerings and a desirable destination appeal, will be crucial.

3.  **Shareholder Return Programs:**
    The company has a consistent program of returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividend payments. For instance, they repurchased $800 million of LVS stock during Q2 2025 and paid a recurring dividend of $0.25 per share. Continued execution of these programs can boost investor confidence and support the stock price.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Expansion and Development in Singapore:**
    Las Vegas Sands is investing $8 billion in a new development project in Singapore, which includes a fourth hotel tower, an arena, and additional convention space, expected to be completed by 2031. This significant expansion signals a long-term commitment to the Singapore market and is expected to drive substantial future earnings. Management believes they are in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of their investments in Singapore.

2.  **Strategic Shift and Optimization in Macau:**
    Management has acknowledged a strategic shift in Macau, moving from a reliance on their buildings to a more competitive approach to increase market share and EBITDA. They believe Macau remains a premier market and, coupled with Singapore's performance, expect to exceed pre-COVID-19 earnings. Continued successful implementation of this strategy, alongside the acceleration of Macau's GGR, could be a significant long-term driver.

3.  **Potential for Sports Betting Legalization in Texas:**
    Las Vegas Sands is actively involved in efforts to legalize sports betting in Texas, with momentum expected to grow in 2026. While facing legislative challenges, the potential for a new market in a large state like Texas could represent a substantial long-term growth opportunity for the company. The company's majority shareholder and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Miriam Adelson, is a strong proponent of this initiative.

4.  **Focus on Convention-Based Integrated Resorts:**
    Las Vegas Sands positions itself as the global leader in convention-based integrated resort development and operation. This model, which attracts high-value leisure and business tourism, is a core part of their strategy for delivering economic growth and employment opportunities in their host communities. Continued focus and successful execution of this model in existing and potential new markets will support long-term growth.

**Management Commentary from Recent Earnings Calls:**

In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Robert Goldstein highlighted the company's strategic shift in Macau, stating, "The market's gotten more competitive in Macau. and we may have been reliant on our buildings... we've shifted our strategy we had to pivot away from that approach and add our buildings to a more competitive approach which we think will fuel more EBITDA more market share." He also emphasized the historic performance of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, noting, "Marina Bay Sands had a historic quarter of $768 million... The record financial results of Marina Bay Sands reflect the impact of high quality investment in market leading product and the growth in high value tourism."

Regarding shareholder returns, management indicated a continued focus: "turning to our program to return capital to shareholders. we were purchased 800 million of LVS stock during the quarter. we also paid our reoccurring dividend of 25 cents per share." They also expressed confidence in future growth, with Goldstein stating, "I think the future of Macau remains very bright... you couple that with what we're doing in Singapore. and we'll soon be exceeding. our highest EB stock creation even during the pre-COVID. years." The company's commitment to reinvestment and expanding its Asian operations remains a key strategic priority.

## Management Incentive

Here's an analysis of the management incentive and compensation for Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS):

1.  **Insider Ownership:**
    *   Insiders hold a significant portion of Las Vegas Sands Corp. stock, with estimates ranging from 48.52% to as high as 683.14% (this latter figure might include shares held through trusts or other indirect means, or could be an error in the source). The Adelson family, through various trusts, appears to be the largest insider shareholder. This high insider ownership suggests that management and directors have a strong personal financial stake in the company's success, aligning their interests with those of other shareholders.

2.  **Compensation Structure:**
    *   Executive compensation at Las Vegas Sands Corp. is a mix of base salary, bonuses, stock options, and other long-term incentives. For instance, the CEO's total compensation can be heavily weighted towards bonuses and stock/options, with salary making up a smaller percentage. This structure is designed to reward performance and incentivize executives to drive company value.

3.  **Executive Compensation Levels:**
    *   Compensation for top executives can be substantial. For example, the CEO's total yearly compensation has been reported around $21.85 million, with other key executives like the CFO also receiving millions in total compensation. While these figures are high, they are often benchmarked against similar-sized companies in the US market.

4.  **Incentive Alignment:**
    *   The substantial insider ownership, particularly by the Adelson family, strongly suggests that management's interests are aligned with shareholders. When a large portion of the company's equity is held by insiders, their financial well-being is directly tied to the stock's performance.
    *   The compensation structure, which includes bonuses and stock-based awards, further incentivizes executives to achieve company goals and increase shareholder value. This is a common practice to ensure that management is motivated by the company's financial success rather than solely personal gain.
    *   While specific details of incentive plans would be found in the DEF 14A filings, the overall structure points towards a system where executive rewards are linked to the company's performance, thereby encouraging actions that benefit shareholders.

## Long Thesis

Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) is poised for significant growth driven by its dominant position in the high-potential Asian markets of Macau and Singapore. The company's strategy of developing large-scale, integrated resorts that cater to a diverse customer base, including convention attendees and high-spending tourists, provides a strong foundation for revenue generation. Continued expansion in Singapore with a multi-billion dollar project, coupled with a revitalized and more competitive approach in Macau, is expected to drive substantial increases in earnings and market share. Furthermore, potential legalization of sports betting in Texas presents a considerable long-term growth opportunity. LVS's commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, alongside a seasoned management team focused on operational excellence and strategic investments, supports a positive outlook for long-term value creation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case for Las Vegas Sands Corp. assumes the following: 
1. Continued economic stability and growth in key Asian markets (Macau and Singapore), leading to sustained tourism and discretionary spending.
2. Successful execution of the $8 billion expansion project in Singapore, delivering projected increases in EBITDA and revenue.
3. Macau's gaming and tourism market continues its recovery and growth trajectory, allowing LVS to gain market share through its enhanced competitive strategy.
4. The company's ability to navigate regulatory environments and geopolitical risks in Asia without significant adverse impacts.
5. The potential legalization and successful integration of sports betting operations in Texas, contributing positively to future revenue streams.
6. Management's ability to effectively manage costs, optimize operations, and allocate capital efficiently to drive shareholder returns.
7. No major unforeseen global events (like pandemics) that severely disrupt international travel and consumer spending.
8. Continued strength in the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) segment, which diversifies revenue and attracts high-value customers.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

Here's a critique of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) long thesis, along with a potential bear case:

## Critique of the Long Thesis

1.  **Over-reliance on Asian Market Recovery:** The thesis heavily relies on the continued recovery and growth of Macau and Singapore. While these markets are important, they are subject to significant external factors like Chinese government policy, economic slowdowns in China, and regional travel trends, which could hinder recovery.
2.  **Singapore Expansion Execution Risk:** The $8 billion Singapore expansion, while a significant opportunity, carries execution risks. Delays, cost overruns, or lower-than-expected demand could negatively impact the projected EBITDA and revenue increases.
3.  **Macau's Increased Competition:** While the thesis mentions a "revitalized and more competitive approach in Macau," the market is intensely competitive with established players and new entrants. Gaining market share in such an environment will be challenging and may require significant investment, potentially impacting margins.
4.  **Geopolitical and Regulatory Uncertainty:** The assumption of navigating regulatory environments and geopolitical risks without significant adverse impacts is optimistic. Changes in Chinese policy, visa restrictions, or broader geopolitical tensions could directly affect LVS's operations and profitability in Asia.
5.  **Texas Sports Betting Speculation:** The potential legalization of sports betting in Texas is a highly speculative long-term opportunity. The timeline for legalization is uncertain, and even if legalized, the competitive landscape and regulatory framework could limit LVS's ability to capitalize on it effectively.
6.  **Unforeseen Global Events:** The assumption that there will be no major unforeseen global events like pandemics is a significant vulnerability. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the devastating impact such events can have on the travel, tourism, and gaming industries.
7.  **MICE Segment Dependence:** While the MICE segment diversifies revenue, its strength is also tied to global economic health and corporate spending, which can be cyclical and sensitive to economic downturns.

## Bear Case Thesis for Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)

1.  **Slowing Macau Recovery and Regulatory Headwinds:** The recovery in Macau may be slower than anticipated due to ongoing economic uncertainties in China and stricter regulatory oversight. Changes in gaming concession rules or VIP segment policies could negatively impact LVS's revenue and profitability.
2.  **Intensifying Competition in Key Markets:** LVS faces stiff competition from other integrated resort operators in both Macau and Singapore. The emergence of new properties or aggressive strategies by rivals could erode LVS's market share and pricing power.
3.  **High Capital Expenditures and Debt Burden:** The significant investments in new projects, particularly in Singapore, will require substantial capital. If revenue growth does not keep pace, this could strain the company's balance sheet and limit its financial flexibility.
4.  **Limited Diversification Outside Asia:** Despite divesting its Las Vegas Strip assets, LVS remains heavily concentrated in Asian markets. This geographical concentration exposes the company to significant risks related to regional economic downturns, political instability, and changing travel patterns.
5.  **Uncertainty of US Market Entry:** The pursuit of new ventures in the U.S., such as sports betting in Texas, faces considerable regulatory hurdles and intense competition. Success in these new, largely unproven markets is far from guaranteed and could dilute management focus.
6.  **Sensitivity to Global Economic Conditions:** As a luxury travel and entertainment provider, LVS is highly sensitive to global economic downturns. A significant recession could lead to reduced discretionary spending, impacting gaming revenue, hotel occupancy, and MICE business.

---

## Next Steps

Here are the next steps and important questions to investigate further for Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS):

1.  **Macau Market Share Dynamics:** Investigate the specific strategies LVS is implementing to regain market share in Macau and analyze the competitive responses from other operators. Understanding the granular details of this competitive shift is crucial.
2.  **Singapore Expansion Execution and Demand:** Research the progress and projected timelines for the $8 billion Singapore expansion. It's important to assess the potential demand for the new arena and convention space and how it aligns with market trends.
3.  **Texas Sports Betting Regulatory Landscape:** Conduct a deeper dive into the specific legislative hurdles and political support for sports betting legalization in Texas. Understanding the timeline and potential revenue implications will be key.
4.  **Impact of Chinese Economic Policies on Tourism:** Analyze how current and potential future economic policies in China might influence outbound tourism to Macau and Singapore. This includes looking at consumer confidence and travel regulations.
5.  **Debt Levels and Refinancing Risk:** Examine LVS's current debt levels and its strategy for managing upcoming debt maturities. High capital expenditures combined with debt could pose a risk if revenue growth falters.
6.  **Sustainability Initiatives and ESG Impact:** Research the tangible outcomes and market perception of LVS's sustainability programs (Sands ECO360). Strong ESG performance can increasingly influence investor decisions and brand reputation.
7.  **MICE Segment Growth Trends:** Investigate the long-term growth trends for the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) sector in Asia. Understanding future demand for convention facilities is vital for LVS's business model.
8.  **Management's Succession Planning:** While Robert Goldstein is currently CEO, it's prudent to understand the long-term succession plan for key leadership positions, especially given the company's history. This ensures leadership stability beyond the current tenure.
9.  **Customer Acquisition Cost and Loyalty Program Effectiveness:** Analyze the cost of acquiring new customers for LVS, especially in competitive markets like Macau, and assess the effectiveness of their loyalty programs in driving repeat business and increasing customer lifetime value.
10. **Impact of Online Gaming Competition:** Further investigate how the rise of online and mobile gaming platforms is affecting traditional brick-and-mortar casino revenue and LVS's strategies to mitigate this trend. This includes understanding any potential for LVS to engage in or partner with online gaming ventures.
