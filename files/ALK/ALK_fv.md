## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The valuation is anchored on Alaska Air Group's **"Alaska Accelerate"** plan, which includes the integration of Hawaiian Airlines and is a key driver for future growth and profitability.

### Business Engine Assumptions

1.  **Profit Target (Core Driver):** Management is committed to achieving a long-term target of **\$10.00 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) by 2027**. This is the central, non-negotiable anchor for the financial model up to 2027.
2.  **Incremental Profit:** The plan targets **\$1.0 Billion in incremental profit by 2027**. This is driven by **\$600 million in synergies** from the Hawaiian Airlines acquisition, premium cabin retrofits, loyalty program enhancements, and network optimization.
3.  **Revenue Growth/Capacity:** Full-year 2025 capacity growth is guided at approximately **2%**. The company is focused on yield-accretive growth through international expansion (e.g., to Tokyo, Seoul, Rome, Reykjavik) and premium cabin sales.
4.  **Margin Target:** The plan aims to regrow margins to a conservative **11% to 13% Pre-Tax Margin by 2027**. We will use the lower, more conservative **11% Pre-Tax Margin** for our model.

### Revenue Projection Justification

The revenue forecast needs to align with the EPS and margin targets.

*   **2024 Pro Forma Revenue Baseline (Estimated):**
    *   Q1-Q3 2025 Revenue (Reported: \$3.1B + \$3.7B + \$3.8B) = \$10.6 Billion.
    *   Assuming Q4 2025 revenue is flat with Q3 2025 revenue (\$3.8B), the projected **FY 2025 Revenue is \$14.4 Billion**.
    *   Given the 2025 capacity growth of $\approx 2\%$ and unit revenue trends, the Pro Forma 2024 Revenue is estimated to be approximately **\$13.84 Billion** ($\approx 14.4B / 1.04$ to account for organic growth + RASM improvements). *This figure serves as a conservative, market-aligned baseline to project the organic growth component.*

| Year | Revenue Calculation (USD Billions) | Year-over-Year Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$14.40 | 4.0% | Based on Q1-Q3 results and a flat Q4, reflecting guided $\approx 2\%$ capacity growth with unit revenue improvements. |
| **2026** | \$15.30 | 6.25% | Mid-point growth to reach 2027 EPS target. Driven by full-year integration of Hawaiian and initial synergy capture, premium cabin retrofits, and new international routes. |
| **2027** | \$16.20 | 5.88% | Final year of *Alaska Accelerate* plan to reach max synergies and EPS target. This implies **\$1.8B in total revenue growth from 2025 to 2027**, supported by the \$1B incremental profit initiatives. |
| **2028** | \$16.85 | 4.00% | Conservative organic growth rate, stepping down after the *Accelerate* plan concludes, driven by fleet expansion (787s for international) and loyalty program maturity. |
| **2029** | \$17.52 | 4.00% | Continued sustainable organic growth, in line with long-term GDP/industry growth. |
| **2030** | \$18.22 | 4.00% | Continued sustainable organic growth. |

## III. Margin and Net Income Projection

### Margin Assumptions

*   **Tax Rate:** I will use a conservative effective tax rate of **25%**.
*   **Net Income Margin (2027 Target):**
    *   Target Pre-Tax Margin (Conservative): 11.0%
    *   Tax-Adjusted Net Income Margin: $11.0\% \times (1 - 0.25) = **8.25\%**$

The Net Income Margin must also align with the **\$10.00 EPS target for 2027**:
*   Total Net Income in 2027 = $\text{\$10.00 EPS} \times 115.31 \text{ million shares} \approx \text{\$1.153 Billion}$
*   2027 Net Income Margin (Implied) = $\text{\$1.153B} / \text{\$16.20B Revenue} \approx **7.12\%**$
*   *Conclusion:* The implied $7.12\%$ Net Income Margin (based on management's EPS target) is more conservative than the $8.25\%$ calculated from the low-end Pre-Tax Margin target. **We will use the implied 7.12% margin for 2027 and a conservative ramp-up and maturity.**

| Year | Revenue (A) (USD Billions) | Net Income Margin (B) | Net Income (A x B) (USD Millions) | ROIC on Prior Year Cash (C) (USD Millions) | Total Net Income (A x B + C) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$14.40 | 2.50% | 360 | 0 | **360** |
| **2026** | \$15.30 | 5.00% | 765 | 13 | **778** |
| **2027** | \$16.20 | 7.12% | 1,153 | 27 | **1,180** |
| **2028** | \$16.85 | 6.80% | 1,146 | 41 | **1,187** |
| **2029** | \$17.52 | 6.50% | 1,139 | 55 | **1,194** |
| **2030** | \$18.22 | 6.25% | 1,139 | 68 | **1,207** |

### ROIC Justification

*   **Net Income into Cash:** We assume all net income for a given year is added to the cash pile for the following year.
*   **ROIC Rate:** Historical Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is cited around 3.52%. Given the projected significant profitability and strategic plan, the true ROIC is expected to be higher, but for conservatism, a constant **3.5% ROIC** is applied to the previous year's accumulated Net Income (cash) to generate additional non-operating income.
    *   $C_{\text{2026}} = \text{3.5\%} \times \text{\$360M (2025 Net Income)} \approx \text{\$13M}$

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### Discount Rate and Maturity Rate

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.5%**. This is a conservative WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) for an airline, reflecting the cyclical, capital-intensive nature of the industry and its current debt load. It is higher than a typical cost of debt but allows for a strong risk premium.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **3.0%**. This is a conservative, perpetual growth rate, slightly above long-term inflation but below the long-term GDP growth rate, representing a mature, stable business past the hyper-growth phase of the *Alaska Accelerate* plan.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow (Total Net Income) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (9.5%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 360 | $1 / (1.095)^1$ = 0.913 | 329 |
| **2026** | 778 | $1 / (1.095)^2$ = 0.834 | 649 |
| **2027** | 1,180 | $1 / (1.095)^3$ = 0.762 | 900 |
| **2028** | 1,187 | $1 / (1.095)^4$ = 0.696 | 826 |
| **2029** | 1,194 | $1 / (1.095)^5$ = 0.636 | 759 |
| **2030** | 1,207 | $1 / (1.095)^6$ = 0.581 | 701 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **4,164** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   **Last Cash Flow ($CF_{\text{2030}}$):** \$1,207 Million
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate ($g$):** 3.0%
*   **Discount Rate ($r$):** 9.5%

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{CF_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$1,207 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.095 - 0.03} = \frac{\$1,243.21 \text{M}}{0.065} \approx \text{\$19,126 \text{ Million}}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value (as of 2024):**

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \$19,126 \text{M} \times 0.581 \approx \text{\$11,113 \text{ Million}}
$$

### Total Equity Value

$$
\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Total Equity Value} = \$4,164 \text{M} + \$11,113 \text{M} + \$2,300 \text{M} - \$5,000 \text{M}
$$

$$
\text{Total Equity Value} = \$17,577 \text{ Million} - \$5,000 \text{ Million} = \text{\$12,577 \text{ Million}}
$$

---

## V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$12,577,000,000}{115,310,000}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} \approx \text{\$109.07}
$$

## Final Valuation Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **\$109.07** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$41.00** |

## VI. Justification and Market Assumptions

The calculated fair value of **\$109.07** is significantly higher than the current market price of **\$41.00**. This implies a substantial difference in the assumptions being made in this valuation versus those being made by the market.

**Justification for the Valuation:**
The valuation is strongly supported by the company's own explicit, publicly-stated, and fundamental targets: **\$10.00 EPS by 2027**. By using this target and a conservative ramp-up, the resulting Net Income figure (\$1.18 Billion) drives the majority of the value. The use of a conservative $3.5\%$ ROIC, a very high $9.5\%$ discount rate for a company projecting $7.12\%$ Net Income margin, and a low $3.0\%$ maturity rate further attempts to *de-risk* the model.

**Why the Market Assumption is So Different:**

The vast difference suggests the market is not giving any credence, or at least a very low probability, to the company achieving its aggressive **\$10.00 EPS by 2027** target. The market is likely pricing in one or more of the following deeply conservative or skeptical assumptions:

1.  **High Execution Risk of Synergies:** The \$1.0 billion in incremental profit (including \$600M in Hawaiian Airlines synergies) is a massive lift for the company. The market is likely skeptical of the company's ability to seamlessly integrate the two airlines and realize the full revenue and cost synergies, particularly given the recent operational headwinds and integration issues.
2.  **Cyclicality and External Shocks:** Airlines are highly sensitive to fuel prices, labor costs, geopolitical events, and economic cycles. The market is discounting future earnings by assuming a near-term recession or a significant spike in fuel/labor costs that would make the $7.12\%$ Net Income Margin (Pre-Tax Margin of 11%) unobtainable.
3.  **Below-Target EPS/High Discount Rate Implied:** To justify a \$41.00 stock price with the $115.31$ million shares and a $\$5.0 \text{ billion}$ debt, the market is effectively using a much lower long-term EPS.
4.  **Conservative DCF Conclusion:** This valuation's confidence in the management's publicly guided targets leads to a strong valuation. The market's price indicates a fundamental skepticism on the *sustainability* or *achievability* of the profit engine, or an application of a much, much higher perceived risk and discount rate. **The current market price is either a deep value opportunity based on management's own forecasts or a fair reflection of the high-risk, low-certainty nature of achieving those forecasts in the airline industry.**
