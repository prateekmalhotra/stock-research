### I. Financial Snapshot & Base Data

The base figures are derived from the most recent SEC filings and management's commentary. A conservative approach is taken for the Balance Sheet items due to reliance on summarized data and a need to be conservative.

| Metric | Source/Justification | Value (in Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | Conservative estimate below the Q1 2025 reported cash of \$34.7M to account for daily operational use. | **\$30.0 Million** |
| **Total Debt** | Conservative estimate. Management's stated goal is to pay down debt (60% of FCF allocation). The reported total liabilities for Q3 2025 were \$328.11M, a significant portion of which is debt. | **\$275.0 Million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | Based on recent financial reports. | **8.72 Million** |
| **FY 2024 Free Cash Flow (FCF)** | Used as the starting "Net Income" Cash Flow for the DCF, as it is a more stable measure of discretionary cash generation than GAAP Net Income, which was significantly impacted by non-cash impairment charges in 2024. FCF for the TTM ended Sep 30, 2024. | **\$10.84 Million** |

### II. The Business Engine and Revenue/Cash Flow Projections

The business engine for RICK is explicitly defined by management's "Back to Basics" capital allocation plan, which focuses on compounding Free Cash Flow (FCF) per share through a disciplined strategy of acquisitions, share buybacks, and debt reduction.

**Key Business Engine Assumptions (Derived from Earnings Calls):**

1.  **Growth Driver:** The primary driver is the acquisition of high-margin Nightclubs (targeting \$6M in Adjusted EBITDA annually) and the continued rationalization/expansion of the Bombshells segment.
2.  **Internal Growth Metric:** Management has explicitly guided for a target of increasing FCF per share by **10% to 15% on a compound annual basis**.
3.  **Conservative Projection:** For a conservative valuation, the *low end* of this guidance will be used:
    *   **Base FCF Growth Rate (New Income Growth):** **10.0%** per year.

#### A. Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

Management has a long-term goal of **\$400 million in revenue by FY2029**. I will use a simple, consistent growth rate to reach this conservative target, then continue that growth for the remaining year.

| Year | FY 2024 (Actual) | FY 2025 (Est.) | FY 2026 (Est.) | FY 2027 (Est.) | FY 2028 (Est.) | FY 2029 (Target) | FY 2030 (Est.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (MM)** | \$295.6 | \$315.6 | \$338.4 | \$362.8 | \$388.9 | **\$400.0** | \$412.0 |
| **YoY Growth** | - | 6.8% | 7.2% | 7.2% | 7.2% | 2.8% (To hit target) | 3.0% (Conservative T-Rate) |

*   **Justification:** The revenue CAGR from FY2024 to the FY2029 target of \$400M is ~6.4%. The model uses slightly higher growth in the mid-years to reflect new club acquisitions before flattening to a very conservative 3.0% growth rate in 2030.

#### B. Net Income (Cash Flow) Projection (2025 - 2030)

Per instructions, the projection uses a starting "Net Income" (proxy FCF) and applies the prescribed growth and ROIC model.

1.  **Projected Base Net Income (FCF Proxy):** FY2024 FCF of \$10.84 Million.
2.  **Growth Rate of Base Income:** 10.0% annually (low end of management guidance).
3.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The company has a history of generating strong returns on its capital expenditures (e.g., targeting 100% cash-on-cash return on club acquisitions in 3-5 years). I will use a conservative ROIC of **12.0%** on the cumulative cash balance, which is reasonable given the historical performance and investment strategy.

| Year | Starting Cash (A) | Base Net Income (B = Prev. B * 1.10) | ROIC on Prior Cash (C = A * 0.12) | **Total Net Income (B + C)** | Ending Cash (A + B + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | \$30.00 | \$10.84 | \$0.00 | **\$10.84** | \$40.84 |
| **2025** | \$40.84 | \$11.92 | \$4.90 | **\$16.82** | \$57.66 |
| **2026** | \$57.66 | \$13.11 | \$6.92 | **\$20.03** | \$77.69 |
| **2027** | \$77.69 | \$14.42 | \$9.32 | **\$23.74** | \$101.43 |
| **2028** | \$101.43 | \$15.86 | \$12.17 | **\$28.03** | \$129.46 |
| **2029** | \$129.46 | \$17.45 | \$15.54 | **\$32.99** | \$162.45 |
| **2030** | \$162.45 | \$19.19 | \$19.49 | **\$38.68** | \$201.13 |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The DCF analysis calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected Net Income (cash flows) using a conservative Discount Rate and a conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Value).

#### A. Rates and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative rate of **10.0%** is used. This is higher than the average cost of capital for a stable hospitality business but is justified given the business's regulatory/reputational risks and the recent stock volatility.
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%** is used, reflecting the long-term stable GDP-like growth of the hospitality sector.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (at end of 2030):**

TV = (Year 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
TV = (\$38.68 Million * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02)
TV = (\$39.45 Million) / 0.08
**Terminal Value (TV) = \$493.13 Million**

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year | Cash Flow (MM) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^n) | Present Value (MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$16.82 | 0.909 | \$15.28 |
| **2026** | \$20.03 | 0.826 | \$16.55 |
| **2027** | \$23.74 | 0.751 | \$17.83 |
| **2028** | \$28.03 | 0.683 | \$19.14 |
| **2029** | \$32.99 | 0.621 | \$20.48 |
| **2030** | \$38.68 | 0.564 | \$21.82 |
| **2030 (TV)** | \$493.13 | 0.564 | \$278.10 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$389.20 Million** |

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$389.20 |
| **PLUS: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$30.00 |
| **LESS: Total Debt** | -\$275.00 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$144.20 Million** |
| **Divide by Shares Outstanding** | / 8.72 Million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$16.54** |

---

### V. Justification and Market Disparity Analysis

#### Justification for the Fair Value of **\$16.54**

The calculated fair value of **\$16.54** is significantly lower than the current market price of approximately **\$24.50**. This conservative valuation is justified by the following factors:

1.  **Conservative FCF Growth Rate:** The model uses the *low-end* of management's own guidance (10.0% FCF per share growth). The market, or less conservative analysts, may be pricing in the *high end* of the 10-15% range or a growth rate that more directly hits the aggressive \$75M FCF target by FY2029, which implies a CAGR of ~48% from the FY2024 base. If the market assumes a higher, albeit riskier, growth rate of **15%**, the valuation would be higher.
2.  **Explicit Risks:** The market may be overly discounting the legal and operational risks that RICK currently faces, including the tax fraud indictment allegations against former executives and material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, which are highlighted in recent filings. My conservative discount rate attempts to account for this, but the market's current price suggests these risks are either dismissed or priced-in as already mitigated.
3.  **Low Terminal Value Growth:** The use of a conservative 2.0% perpetual growth rate severely limits the Terminal Value. The market is likely pricing in a higher long-term growth rate, perhaps 3.0-4.0%, which would significantly increase the TV and, consequently, the share price.
4.  **Capital Structure Assumptions:** The use of conservative (low) cash and (high) debt figures is designed to depress the final value. The market may assume a more favorable debt paydown schedule or a more aggressive divestiture of underperforming assets than the model accounts for, which would lead to a higher equity value.

**Conclusion on Market Assumptions:**

The market's current price of **\$24.50** implies that investors believe RICK will execute on the **higher end of its strategic growth plan** (12-15% FCF growth per share) and successfully navigate the legal/reputational risks without significant financial penalty.

*   To justify the current market price of **\$24.50**, the market is implicitly using an average annual Net Income (FCF) growth rate closer to **12.5%** or assuming a higher perpetual growth rate of around 3.0%, along with a lower Discount Rate. My valuation remains conservative by adhering to the lower end of management's guidance to create a margin of safety.
