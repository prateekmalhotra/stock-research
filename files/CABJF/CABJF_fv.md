### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

#### Business Engine Justification:
The core of Carlsberg's growth is articulated in its refreshed strategy, **"Accelerate SAIL."** The business engine is driven by:
1.  **Premiumization:** Strong volume growth in the premium portfolio (e.g., Carlsberg premium, 1664 Blanc, Brooklyn) which leads to a higher Revenue per Hectoliter ($Revenue/hl$). This strategy allows the company to offset cost inflation through price and mix improvements.
2.  **Geographic Expansion:** Continued robust growth in Asia (China, India, Vietnam) and CEEI (Central & Eastern Europe and India).
3.  **New Growth Categories:** Significant expansion into soft drinks and non-alcoholic brews, with the **Britvic acquisition** (expected to close Q1 2025) doubling soft drink exposure to approximately 30% of the portfolio. This acquisition is a major growth lever.

#### Revenue Growth Assumptions (Conservative):
Management has increased its long-term organic revenue growth ambition to a **4-6% CAGR**. To remain **conservative**, the model uses the lower end of this guidance for the initial years, declining gradually:

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (E)** | 4.00% | This is the lower end of the new long-term guidance (4-6% CAGR) and a reasonable rate considering the benefit of the Britvic acquisition in 2025 will be partially offset by macro uncertainty and currency headwinds in 2024. |
| **2025 (E)** | 4.50% | Reflects the full-year contribution of the Britvic acquisition and the focus on high-growth premium/soft drink segments. |
| **2026 (E)** | 4.00% | Reverting to a more modest, yet strategic-driven, long-term rate. |
| **2027 (E)** | 3.50% | Conservative slowdown. |
| **2028 (E)** | 3.00% | Conservative slowdown. |
| **2029 (E)** | 2.50% | Conservative slowdown. |
| **2030 (E)** | 2.00% | Approaching the Terminal Growth Rate. |

#### Margin and ROIC Assumptions:
*   **Net Income Margin:** Management guides for organic operating profit growth **above** the 4-6% revenue growth, driven by continued gross margin improvement. A conservative, gradual margin expansion is thus warranted.
    *   *2023 Margin:* 10.09% (as calculated above).
    *   *Assumption:* The Net Income Margin will start at 10.20% in 2024 and gradually improve to 11.00% by 2030, reflecting operational efficiencies and the positive mix effect of premium products and the high-margin soft drink business.
*   **ROIC:** The historical ROIC (continuing operations) of **15.2%** is used. This is a reasonable and historical metric to project additional income from retained earnings.

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

#### DCF Assumptions:
*   **Net Income (NI) Calculation:** $NI_{t} = (Projected Revenue_{t} * Projected Margin_{t}) + (Cash from Previous Year * ROIC)$
    *   $Cash$ in this calculation represents the accumulated net income from the previous year, which is assumed to be reinvested at the ROIC rate to generate additional income.
*   **Conservative Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate:** **1.5%** (A mature, defensive company like Carlsberg, growing slightly above inflation).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **8.0%** (A conservative, yet reasonable rate for a large, established consumer staples business with low leverage (NIBD/EBITDA 1.47x).

#### A. Projected Financials and Cash Flow (DKK Million)

| Year | Projected Revenue | Revenue Growth | Net Income Margin | NI from Operations | ROIC on Accumulated Cash | Total Net Income | Discount Factor (8.0%) | NPV of Net Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2023 (Actual)** | 73,585 | N/A | 10.09% | 7,425 | N/A | 7,425 | N/A | N/A |
| **2024 (E)** | 76,528 | 4.00% | 10.20% | 7,806 | (7,425 * 15.2%) = 1,129 | 8,935 | 0.9259 | 8,266 |
| **2025 (E)** | 79,977 | 4.50% | 10.40% | 8,318 | (8,935 * 15.2%) = 1,358 | 9,676 | 0.8573 | 8,309 |
| **2026 (E)** | 83,176 | 4.00% | 10.60% | 8,817 | (9,676 * 15.2%) = 1,471 | 10,288 | 0.7938 | 8,166 |
| **2027 (E)** | 86,086 | 3.50% | 10.70% | 9,211 | (10,288 * 15.2%) = 1,564 | 10,775 | 0.7350 | 7,921 |
| **2028 (E)** | 88,668 | 3.00% | 10.80% | 9,576 | (10,775 * 15.2%) = 1,638 | 11,214 | 0.6806 | 7,632 |
| **2029 (E)** | 90,880 | 2.50% | 10.90% | 9,906 | (11,214 * 15.2%) = 1,705 | 11,611 | 0.6302 | 7,318 |
| **2030 (E)** | 92,700 | 2.00% | 11.00% | 10,200 | (11,611 * 15.2%) = 1,765 | 11,965 | 0.5835 | 6,983 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flow (2024-2030)** | | | | | | | | **54,595** |

#### B. Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{Cash Flow_{2030} * (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$
*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{11,965 * (1 + 0.015)}{(0.080 - 0.015)}$
*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{12,144}{0.065} = 186,831 \text{ DKK Million}$

#### C. Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value

*   $NPV \text{ of } TV = TV_{2030} * \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   $NPV \text{ of } TV = 186,831 * 0.5835$
*   $NPV \text{ of } TV = 109,006 \text{ DKK Million}$

#### D. Total Equity Value

*   $\text{Total Enterprise Value} = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flow} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
*   $\text{Total Enterprise Value} = 54,595 + 109,006 = 163,601 \text{ DKK Million}$
*   $\text{Equity Value} = \text{Total Enterprise Value} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$
*   $\text{Equity Value} = 163,601 + 16,700 - 39,100 = 141,201 \text{ DKK Million}$

### IV. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

*   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$
*   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{DKK 141,201,000,000}}{134,114,000 \text{ shares}}$
*   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \text{DKK 1,052.84}$

### Fair Value Conclusion

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DKK)** | **DKK 1,052.84** |
| **Current Stock Price (CARL B, DKK)** | DKK 760.80 |
| **Current Stock Price (CABJF, USD)** | $114.95 |

**The calculated Fair Value of DKK 1,052.84 suggests an undervaluation of approximately 38.4% compared to the current market price of DKK 760.80.**

#### Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Value)

The significant difference between the calculated Fair Value and the Market Value implies that the market is making a more conservative set of assumptions than those derived from the company's own guidance.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions (More Conservative than Model):**

1.  **Lower Growth Rate:** The market is likely discounting management's **4-6% CAGR** guidance due to persistent global macro uncertainty, as noted by the CEO regarding the consumer environment. The market may be assuming the *organic* revenue growth will hover at the lower end or below, particularly after factoring out the one-time, acquisitive growth from Britvic. The model started at 4.0% and declined, which is already conservative, but the market may price in a higher risk of stagnation.
2.  **Zero/Slower Margin Expansion:** The market may not fully believe Carlsberg can execute the promised **gross margin improvement and operating profit growth above revenue growth** due to continued inflationary pressure and the need for high commercial investments ($S&M$ up >10% in 2024). If the market assumes the margin remains flat at 10.09% (2023 level) instead of improving to 11.00%, the valuation drops.
3.  **Higher Execution Risk for Acquisitions:** The **Britvic acquisition** and the full consolidation of operations in India/Nepal introduce integration and execution risk that the market is applying a discount for. The full synergy potential may not be materialized, or the non-beer segments may not grow as fast as projected.
4.  **Higher Discount Rate:** The market may be applying a higher **Discount Rate (WACC)** than the 8.0% used in the model due to global interest rate environment, geopolitical instability (e.g., Ukraine risk is mentioned in transcripts), and currency volatility, which has historically impacted reported results. A higher discount rate (e.g., 9.5%) would significantly reduce the NPV, bringing the fair value closer to the current price.

**My Case for the Higher Fair Value:**

The model's higher Fair Value is justified by adhering to the **management's own communicated strategy and financial targets**:
1.  **Strategy Alignment:** The core of the valuation follows the "Accelerate SAIL" strategy for growth via premiumization (higher $Revenue/hl$) and doubling down on the high-growth soft drinks segment (Britvic).
2.  **Conservative Inputs:** The revenue growth rate (4.0% to 2.0%) is at the low end of, or below, management's 4-6% CAGR ambition. The Terminal Growth Rate of 1.5% and the Discount Rate of 8.0% are deliberately conservative for a global, defensive staples business.
3.  **Demonstrated ROIC:** The model uses the historically demonstrated 15.2% ROIC, indicating the management's capability to generate value from reinvested earnings.

The current market price appears to undervalue the future free cash flow potential of the company, particularly the synergistic and growth potential embedded in the high-multiple Britvic and premium/Asia strategies. The discrepancy suggests an **opportunity**, assuming management can successfully execute on its stated strategy and deliver on its long-term growth and margin expansion targets.
