## Business Summary

RLX Technology Inc. is a leading provider of electronic cigarette and vaping products in China. The company’s core business model revolves around designing devices and selling consumable nicotine liquid pods, which generate recurring revenue. Its customers are adult consumers, almost entirely located within China. RLX uses an authorized B2B distribution network of exclusive partners and physical stores to get its products to market, rather than selling directly to consumers. Historically, revenue was heavily reliant on the continuous purchase of these non-rechargeable pods by users.

## Business Model Risk

The primary risk for RLX is its extreme dependency on the regulatory environment in China, which has proven to be highly unstable. A massive threat occurred in 2022 when the Chinese government nationalized the industry, imposing strict national standards and heavy excise taxes. This near-term risk directly caused the long-term risk of severely restricted flavor options (banning most popular non-tobacco flavors), which dramatically shrinks the potential consumer market and harms profitability. Since the government now controls distribution through a centralized platform, RLX faces ongoing danger that authorities could implement further measures, such as imposing even higher taxes or mandating sales limitations, that prioritize public health goals over the company’s earnings and market position, making future revenue highly unpredictable.

## Company History

RLX Technology Inc. (NYSE: RLX), which operates under the brand name **RELX**, is a company that develops, manufactures, and sells electronic vapor (e-vapor) products. It is the leading branded e-vapor company that operates within the strictly regulated Chinese market, while also expanding globally.

Here is a detailed history of the company from its founding to the present day:

### **Inception and Founding (2018 - 2020)**

1.  **Founding and Goal:** RLX Technology Inc. was founded in January 2018 in Beijing, China, by a team including CEO Kate Wang, with the core goal of developing a trusted e-vapor brand for adult smokers. Their mission centered on **harm reduction** by providing an alternative to traditional combustible cigarettes through superior products and scientific advances.

2.  **Initial Business Model and Products:** The company focused on closed-system e-cigarettes, which consist of a rechargeable device and replaceable, snap-in cartridges (or "pods") containing e-liquid. They quickly established an extensive integrated distribution network primarily through branded offline retail stores tailored to the Chinese market.

3.  **Major Tailwinds (Early Success):** The company was extremely fortunate to launch into a rapidly growing Chinese e-cigarette market with limited established competition. This allowed for a swift ascent, and the company quickly became the dominant player, capturing a substantial market share in China within just two years.

4.  **Innovation and Early Differentiation:** From the start, RLX invested heavily in research and development to create advanced vaping technology. Key innovations included proprietary ceramic heating technology and the development of a leak-proof pod system, which significantly improved the user experience and helped them stand out.

### **Major Milestones and Headwinds (2021 - Present)**

5.  **The IPO and Peak Valuation (2021):** The company completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in January 2021, raising approximately $1.4 billion. This event, which provided a massive influx of capital, marked the peak of their early success, though it occurred just as significant regulatory challenges began to emerge.

6.  **The Big Headwind: Chinese Regulation (2021-2023):** The single biggest challenge RLX faced was the introduction of stringent new national regulations by the Chinese government. These rules fundamentally reshaped the business environment by classifying e-cigarettes as traditional tobacco products.

7.  **Impact of Regulations:** The new rules included a ban on online sales, the introduction of a high consumption tax, and, most notably, a ban on all non-tobacco flavors for the domestic market. Because popular flavored products were a huge part of their early growth, these policies caused the company’s domestic revenues to plunge by over 80% from their high point.

### **Strategic Adaptation and Solutions (2022 - Present)**

8.  **Solution 1: Commitment to Compliance and R&D:** The company chose a strategy of compliance rather than defiance. They invested heavily in compliance infrastructure, secured one of the few national manufacturing licenses, and focused their domestic product line exclusively on government-approved tobacco flavors, ensuring they could continue operating legally.

9.  **Solution 2: The Global Pivot (Innovation in Strategy):** The most innovative and critical solution to survive the domestic market crackdown was a dramatic shift to **geographic diversification**. RLX focused on aggressive international expansion, targeting high-growth overseas markets like Southeast Asia and Oceania.

10. **Present-Day Transformation:** This international strategy was highly successful. As of recent reports, the company is no longer solely a China-centric business; international markets have become the primary engine for growth, accounting for a substantial portion of their net revenues. This transformation, moving from a single-market-dependent company to a global brand, demonstrates their resilience and adaptability.

11. **Current Goal and Outlook:** RLX Technology Inc. remains a leading global branded e-vapor company, leveraging its strong technology and R&D capabilities. Their current goal is to sustain profitability and growth by successfully navigating the complex, highly-regulated global landscape, focusing on product innovation within compliant boundaries, and defending its market share both at home and in its new international markets.

## Moat Analysis

RLX Technology Inc.'s core advantages, or "moat," stem less from technology alone and more from its dominant brand position, vast distribution network, and superior capital structure, all operating within a highly regulated market.

Here is an analysis of RLX Technology's moat and differentiation:

### **The Moat and Competitive Advantages**

1.  **Regulatory Compliance as a Barrier to Entry:** RLX operates as a "leading compliant player" in China's heavily regulated e-vapor market, where the government has banned flavored products and halted online sales. This regulatory environment acts as a significant, high-cost barrier that deters new competitors, especially smaller ones, and helps eliminate non-compliant competitors.
2.  **Extensive Offline Distribution Network:** Before the stringent regulations, RLX rapidly built an extensive offline distribution system, including "Branded stores plus" retail model, which is essential for reaching adult smokers in the mainland China market. This physical network is a difficult and expensive asset for new rivals to replicate.
3.  **Closed-System Customer Lock-in:** The company primarily sells closed-system rechargeable vaping devices, which require customers to buy recurring, proprietary prefilled cartridges ("pods"). This design creates a strong revenue-generating loop and high customer switching costs, as users must buy RLX-branded cartridges for their devices.
4.  **Massive Financial War Chest:** RLX possesses a massive amount of cash and investments (a "war chest," RMB 16.4 billion or $2.2 billion as of late 2025), giving it a strong financial advantage. This capital provides a buffer against regulatory changes and allows it to fund aggressive R&D, strategic acquisitions, and rapid international expansion.
5.  **Brand Dominance and Customer Loyalty:** By establishing its "RELX" brand early and aggressively in China, the company built significant brand recognition and early customer loyalty before the regulatory crackdown. This loyal base is crucial for maintaining market share in a consumer-facing industry.

### **Differentiation and Pricing Power**

1.  **Differentiation via R&D and Safety Focus:** The company invests heavily in research and development, focusing on product safety, quality control, and compliance with national standards. This investment goes into proprietary technologies like ceramic coil atomizers, which enhance the user experience and differentiate its products on performance and reliability.
2.  **Special Position as a Licensed Operator:** RLX's crucial position is rooted in being one of the few national players to secure the necessary manufacturing and sales licenses following the regulatory overhaul in China. This legal right to operate creates a near-monopolistic advantage over unlicensed domestic competitors.
3.  **Pricing Power is Constrained but Exists in the Premium Segment:** While the implementation of high consumption taxes and regulatory controls has impacted the company's overall pricing power, it maintains a competitive position in the **premium** segment of the market. Its brand strength and compliance allow it to command a higher price than non-compliant or inferior products.
4.  **Innovation is Continuous and Necessary:** The business requires constant innovation, especially post-regulation, to maintain its edge. R&D efforts are focused on improving battery life, enhancing flavor delivery (within legal limits), and developing new harm-reduction products like modern-oral nicotine lines for international markets.

### **Growth, Displacement Risk, and Customer Stickiness**

1.  **Reason for Initial Growth:** RLX grew rapidly by being an early mover in the Chinese e-vapor market with an aggressive expansion strategy and effective product development. It quickly captured a dominant market share through its extensive offline retail network before the major government intervention.
2.  **Risk of Displacement by Capital:** The company is relatively insulated from being easily displaced by a competitor with more capital due to the significant non-financial barriers. The existing distribution network, a large cash balance, and the hard-to-acquire regulatory licenses in China all make displacement extremely difficult, even with a larger budget.
3.  **Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The revenue model is inherently sticky and recurring because the customer base relies on constant purchases of proprietary cartridges for their reusable RLX devices. This cartridge-based system ensures a stream of recurring sales rather than a one-time transaction.
4.  **Moat-Building Strategy:** RLX is actively solidifying its moat by diversifying its revenue stream with rapid international expansion, which now accounts for a significant and growing portion of sales. This strategy hedges against future regulatory shocks in any single market and leverages its product and R&D capabilities globally.

## Catalyst Analysis

RLX Technology's stock catalysts are largely centered on its successful shift toward international markets, product innovation, and disciplined financial management, which mitigate the impact of the challenging regulatory environment in its home market, Mainland China.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 1-4 Quarters)

1.  **Continued International Revenue Growth:** The company's **globalization strategy** is delivering strong results, with international markets accounting for a significant portion of total revenue (70%-80% of Q3 2025 revenue). Management explicitly states they anticipate continued revenue growth through further expansion and market share capture abroad.
2.  **Product Innovation and Adaptation:** The successful launch of new products, such as the "Big Puff" disposable e-vapor products to adapt to specific regulatory changes and consumer trends, can provide immediate revenue boosts in international markets.
3.  **Increased Profitability and Operational Efficiency:** Recent earnings calls show improvement in the gross profit margin, driven by a favorable geographic revenue mix and margin enhancements in key international regions. The company also maintains a healthy negative cash conversion cycle, which shows efficient working capital management.
4.  **Shareholder Return Program:** The commitment to returning value to shareholders through **cash dividends** (recently declared in Q2 and Q3 2025) and an ongoing **share repurchase program** provides direct support for the stock price. Management has returned over $500 million to shareholders since the IPO.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 1 Year)

1.  **Expansion into Modern Oral Category:** The company is initiating a phased rollout of a **Modern Oral Product** in markets like Germany, which is a new and fast-growing category in the smokeless segment. This diversification is key to securing a long-term position in reduced-risk alternatives.
2.  **Potential Recovery in Mainland China:** While the Mainland China business is still heavily impacted by regulation (Q3 2025 revenue was only about 13% of Q2 2021 levels), any **gradual recovery or positive regulatory clarity** in this massive market would significantly increase revenue. Management noted a "gradual recovery" in the country in a recent earnings call.
3.  **Leveraging a Strong Cash Position:** With total financial assets of approximately $2.2 billion as of Q3 2025, RLX has a solid foundation for strategic investments, capital expenditures, or future mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to further accelerate its international expansion and innovation efforts.
4.  **Sustained Globalization Strategy Success:** **CEO Kate Wang** emphasizes that their strategy involves global compliance, data-driven localized strategies, and deepening strategic partnerships to reinforce their leadership in the dynamic e-vapor sector. This sustained execution should deliver long-term value.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of RLX Technology Inc.'s regulatory filings, including its Form 20-F, the management incentive and compensation structure strongly aligns the interests of the top leadership with the long-term performance of the company's shares.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for RLX Technology Inc. (RLX)**

1.  **Extremely High Insider Ownership and Voting Control:**
    *   The co-founder, Chairperson, and CEO, Ms. Ying (Kate) Wang, holds a substantial personal stake and, more critically, controls all of the company's Class B ordinary shares.
    *   Since each Class B share is entitled to ten votes compared to one vote for Class A shares, this gives the CEO **more than 50% of the total voting power**, granting her "controlled company" status.
    *   This structure means that the CEO's personal wealth and control are directly dependent on the sustained, long-term value of RLX Technology.

2.  **Compensation Heavily Weighted Toward Equity:**
    *   The company's compensation structure heavily relies on **share-based compensation** (stock options and restricted share units/RSUs) for its directors and executive officers.
    *   RLX recorded significant share-based compensation expenses of RMB 369.7 million in 2024, indicating a major component of executive pay is tied to equity awards that vest over time.
    *   This strong emphasis on equity ensures that managers benefit most when the company's stock price increases, aligning their financial outcomes with those of the broader shareholder base.

3.  **Shareholder-Friendly Capital Allocation:**
    *   Management has demonstrated an external focus on enhancing shareholder value through active capital management, including executing a **share repurchase program** and distributing **cash dividends**.
    *   These actions suggest a commitment to improving returns for all shareholders alongside the internal, equity-based incentives.

### **Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

The management of RLX Technology Inc. has **more than enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders** through the fundamental structure of ownership and compensation.

*   **Incentive for Shareholder Interest:** The very high, controlling stake held by the co-founder/CEO and the large component of equity-based compensation directly tie their personal financial success to increases in the long-term stock price and overall company value. For the CEO, lining her own pockets requires improving the value of her own dominant shareholding, which benefits all shareholders proportionally.
*   **Potential for Minority Shareholder Conflict:** Due to the "controlled company" status and the dual-class share structure, the company is not required to adhere to certain corporate governance standards, such as having a majority of independent directors. While the majority shareholder is incentivized for company value creation, this structure does present a risk that the interests of *minority* shareholders could be overruled or marginalized by the concentrated voting power of the co-founder.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of RLX Technology Inc.'s (RLX) price history and recent technical indicators:

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock's price is near the middle of its recent range, with a 52-week low of $1.66 and a 52-week high of $2.84.
2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** As of a recent close price of approximately $2.37, the stock is trading around **42.77%** above its 52-week low of $1.66.

4.  **Technical Analysis Outlook (Trading Low):** The technical analysis signals are generally mixed to negative. Multiple moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA100, MA200) often show "Sell" signals, suggesting a more bearish or strong sell outlook based on these indicators, which may imply the stock is not yet technically "low" enough to trigger a strong buy signal across the board.
5.  **Explanation for Recent Rises:** The stock was recently "up bigly" on a smaller scale following its **Q3 2025 financial results**, which announced net revenues were up 49% year-over-year.
6.  **Driver of Recent Growth:** This revenue growth was largely driven by the company's **international market expansion**, with international markets now generating 70-80% of revenues.
7.  **Positive Corporate Action:** RLX also announced a significant corporate action with the declaration of a **dividend**, which is often viewed positively by the market and can contribute to stock price stability or upward movement.
8.  **Valuation Insight:** Despite the technical warnings, some fundamental analysis suggests RLX may be trading below its intrinsic value, according to an updated version of the Benjamin Graham Formula.

## Long Thesis

RLX Technology Inc.'s future success hinges on its transformation from a China-dependent company into a global e-vapor leader. Near-term growth is driven by aggressive international expansion, which now accounts for the majority of sales and provides immediate relief from strict Chinese regulations. This global pivot, combined with effective cost control, is leading to higher revenue and better profitability right now. Long-term, RLX will leverage its massive cash reserve (over $2 billion) and specialized R&D to enter new high-growth categories, such as modern oral nicotine products, and secure market share in new regions (like Europe and the Middle East). Its business model ensures recurring revenue because loyal customers must continuously purchase proprietary nicotine pods for their devices. Additionally, the company is highly compliant in China, which protects its remaining domestic market share and allows it to gradually recover sales in the world's largest consumer base, while consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario assumes that the rapid international growth will continue without facing regulatory shocks as severe as those experienced in China. It assumes the company will successfully use its massive cash reserves to fund profitable growth and innovation, rather than poorly executed acquisitions. Crucially, it assumes the Chinese government will not impose further, crippling taxes or rules that extinguish the company's remaining compliant tobacco-flavored sales in its home market, allowing the domestic business to stabilize as a reliable, if smaller, profit generator.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for RLX Technology Inc. (RLX) provides a bullish framework based on international diversification and cash reserves. However, a deeper look at the market and regulatory context reveals several critical vulnerabilities and over-optimistic assumptions.

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Oversimplified Global Regulatory Risk:** The long thesis assumes international growth will continue "without facing regulatory shocks as severe as those experienced in China." However, the e-vapor industry is facing dynamic and fragmented global regulation, including potential prohibitions and increased taxation in markets like Europe and the Middle East, which could cripple new segments just as swiftly as the Chinese flavor ban did to the domestic business.

2.  **Uncertainty and Competition in New Categories (Modern Oral):** The thesis relies on a successful pivot to "new high-growth categories, such as modern oral nicotine products." While RLX has launched an "oral dissolvable film," its product format and market traction are unproven against the dominant and rapidly growing **nicotine pouch** segment (e.g., PMI’s ZYN, Altria's on!). Their product innovation is a *film*, not a pouch, placing them outside the established primary growth vector of the category and facing major, well-capitalized global tobacco competitors.

3.  **The Domestic Market is Permanently Impaired (Capped Recovery):** The belief that the domestic business can "gradually recover sales" overlooks the permanent structural damage inflicted by Chinese regulations. The 36% wholesale tax on e-vapor products has significantly compressed gross margins (down from ~50% pre-tax to ~27% in Q3 2024), and the national flavor ban limits products to a tobacco-only flavor profile. The domestic market is now a highly-taxed, non-flavored oligopoly where a "recovery" can only ever be a fraction of its former peak.

4.  **Quality of International Revenue and Illicit Competition:** While international sales now drive the majority of revenue, this growth is being achieved in markets where unlicensed disposable vape products are highly prevalent. This competition can pressure pricing, reduce margins, and expose RLX to potential brand and compliance risks if its legitimate, compliant products have to compete with cheap, illicit goods.

5.  **Capital Efficiency Risk (Cash Drag):** The "massive cash reserve (over $2 billion)" is cited as a strength. However, the continued accumulation of such a large cash pile relative to its market capitalization and growth investments suggests a severe **"cash drag"** and lack of high-return opportunities. While capital is being returned to shareholders, this slow deployment of capital, rather than investing it for transformative growth, indicates management may lack a viable, large-scale long-term growth engine to utilize its substantial resources.

## Bear Case Thesis

**RLX is a High-Cost, High-Regulation Chinese Stock With a Fragile Global Growth Engine and a Capital Deployment Problem.**

1.  **Revenues are Precarious and Low-Margin:** The company's revenue heavily relies on a fragmented and highly competitive international market (70%+ of revenue) that is susceptible to the same kind of unpredictable regulatory shocks—sudden flavor bans or punitive taxation—that destroyed its peak domestic profitability. High compliance costs and intense competition from illicit products further pressure the sustainability and quality of this growth.

2.  **Impaired Domestic Valuation:** The compliant domestic business is permanently disadvantaged, operating under the effective control of the state tobacco monopoly and burdened by a 36% sales tax. This caps the valuation of the domestic operation, making any future growth a slow, measured rebound from a much smaller profit base, not a return to past highs.

3.  **The "Pivot to New Categories" is a Longshot:** RLX's effort to enter the modern oral market with an "oral dissolvable film" is a late and tangential entry to a high-growth segment already dominated by global tobacco majors (PMI, Altria) with vastly superior distribution and established **nicotine pouch** brands. The required investment and regulatory hurdles in key markets like the U.S. (e.g., PMTA) make their success a high-risk, unproven long-term bet.

4.  **Value-Destruction Risk from Cash:** The $2+ billion cash reserve, while a safety net, represents an underutilized asset on the balance sheet. This cash creates an opportunity cost and a risk of poor capital allocation, either through low-yield, short-term investments or through expensive, poorly executed acquisitions in an attempt to buy growth or market share, as opposed to generating profitable organic expansion.

## Next Steps

Based on your thorough analysis, the company's strategy, and the significant known risks (China's permanent damage and global regulation), the next phase of investigation should pivot from *fact-finding* to *quantitative stress-testing* and *competitive benchmarking*.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should investigate.

### **I. Quantify the International Regulatory Risk (Stress Test)**

1.  **Modeling the UK Disposable Ban Impact:** Seek to quantify the initial revenue percentage derived from disposable products in international markets before the UK ban (June 2025). The company has stated it is pivoting to compliant "Big Puff" refillables and acquired the compliant UK retailer *Totally Wicked* to mitigate the impact. You must now model how much lost disposable revenue the TW acquisition and new refillable sales *actually* covered to stress-test the international growth forecast.
2.  **New Global Tax Exposure:** Investigate the specific financial implications of the new e-liquid excise tax proposed for the UK and other major growth markets (e.g., Ireland, Spain). This is an imminent headwind; you need to estimate the **additional Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** this new tax will impose and how much it will depress gross margins in key regions.
3.  **Asia-Pacific Regulatory Timeline:** Pinpoint the next likely regulatory moves in key Asian growth markets like Indonesia and the Philippines. Unexpected bans or punitive taxes in these large, fast-growing markets could be the *next* "China shock," and you need a timeline to assess the geographical risk.

### **II. Assess the Modern Oral Product Viability (Growth Deep Dive)**

4.  **Sales Traction for Oral Film:** Financial reporting contains no sales figures for the new oral dissolvable film. Search non-traditional sources (e-commerce sales rank data, industry distributor feedback, or consumer forums in the UK/US) to find *any* indication of early consumer adoption or competitive traction against the dominant **nicotine pouch** format (ZYN, on!).
5.  **Competitive Differentiation Analysis:** Research the consumer perception of nicotine *films* versus *pouches*. The long thesis relies on this segment; you need to confirm if the film's technology (bioavailability, mouthfeel, duration) offers a significant, compelling competitive advantage over the established pouch format that justifies the company's tangential product choice.

### **III. Analyze Capital Efficiency and Valuation**

6.  **Real Rate of Cash Deployment:** You know management is returning net profit and using cash for targeted acquisitions (like *Totally Wicked*). Determine the *total price* of the *Totally Wicked* acquisition and the total annual CapEx or R&D spending compared to the recurring **$2.2 billion cash reserve**. This will confirm if the cash is truly a strategic war chest for growth or simply a massive, underutilized asset (a "cash drag") that is currently being deployed only slowly through dividends/buybacks.
7.  **China Domestic Margin Recovery:** Create a model to estimate the *specific* gross margin of the **domestic China business** in the latest quarter (Q3 2025). This should be isolated from the high-margin international mix to assess the true profit profile of the permanently impaired, tobacco-flavor-only China segment and estimate its real, reliable base value.
8.  **Peer Valuation Benchmarking:** Conduct a detailed comparative analysis using peers such as **PMI (ZYN)**, **Altria (on!)**, and other publicly traded pure-play e-vapor companies. Compare RLX's **EV/Sales, Forward P/E**, and **Price-to-Cash (P/Cash)** ratios to determine if the stock is truly undervalued relative to its growth rate, or simply cheap due to high political/regulatory risk.
