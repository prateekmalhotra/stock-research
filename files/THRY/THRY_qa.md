## Business Summary

Thryv Holdings, Inc. primarily serves small and medium-sized local businesses (B2B), such as contractors, local service providers, and professional offices, mostly located in the US and Australia. Its core business model is built around a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, where clients pay a regular subscription fee to access an all-in-one digital toolbox that helps them manage appointments, billing, payments, and online marketing. This high-growth subscription software segment is strategically replacing the company’s legacy business, which historically relied on providing printed marketing services, like Yellow Pages directories, which now represent a diminishing but still significant source of overall revenue.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk involves managing the transition away from its higher-margin, but shrinking, legacy print business to the faster-growing SaaS platform. If the revenue from printed directories declines faster than the subscription revenue can make up the difference, it could seriously harm immediate earnings. A long-term threat is intense competition in the SMB software market, where large technology companies and specialized providers constantly innovate; Thryv must continuously invest heavily in its platform to retain relevance against strong rivals, a failure to do so could result in lost market position. Furthermore, because its customers are small businesses, Thryv is highly exposed to economic downturns; historically, during recessions, small businesses are often the first to cut non-essential software subscriptions, leading to higher customer cancellations and slower growth for the company.

## Company History

The history of Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) is a classic business story of transformation: moving from an old-economy print business to a modern technology company.

### 1. The Company's Inception and Founding Purpose

1.  **A Legacy in Print:** The company's origins are deeply rooted in the traditional phone book and Yellow Pages industry, with its historical timeline tracing back to companies like Southwestern Bell Media in 1999.
2.  **Formation of the Predecessor:** A major step in its history was the creation of **Dex Media** in 2014 through the merger of two large print and digital directory companies, Dex One and SuperMedia.
3.  **The Founding Vision:** The core business was initially a large local marketing and advertising company, built to connect consumers with local small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) through both print directories and early digital solutions.

### 2. The Critical Business Problem and Transformation

4.  **The Looming Headwind (The Problem):** The biggest problem the company faced was the swift and undeniable decline of the print advertising industry; as people increasingly turned to the internet and smartphones for local searches, the Yellow Pages model became outdated.
5.  **The Financial Crisis:** Due to the decline and heavy debt, the predecessor company, Dex Media, had to file for financial restructuring (Chapter 11 bankruptcy) in 2016 to clean up its balance sheet and survive.
6.  **The Pivot to Software:** Recognizing this existential threat, the company leadership, notably CEO Joe Walsh, made a strategic decision to completely pivot the business model away from the declining print industry and toward a cloud-based **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** model.

### 3. Innovative Solutions and Rebranding

7.  **The Innovative Solution (The Thryv Platform):** The company developed its flagship product, the **Thryv platform**, an all-in-one software solution designed specifically for small businesses.
8.  **What the Platform Does:** This platform aims to simplify running a small business by combining tools like customer relationship management (CRM), online scheduling, payment processing (ThryvPay), social media management, and reputation monitoring into a single piece of software. The simple goal is to help small businesses "get the job, manage the job, and get credit" for their work.
9.  **Rebranding and New Identity:** In 2017, the company merged with another directory publisher, YP Holdings, to become DexYP, and then officially rebranded to **Thryv Holdings, Inc.** in 2019, cementing the shift from a print-directory company to a software company focused on helping small businesses "thrive".
10. **Going Public:** In October 2020, Thryv Holdings, Inc. listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, completing its transformation into a publicly traded software company.

### 4. Tailwinds and Headwinds

11. **Major Tailwind (Market Opportunity):** The company was fortunate to have a significant **tailwind** in the large and relatively untapped market of small and medium-sized businesses that needed modern digital tools but were overwhelmed by complex, piecemeal software solutions.
12. **Another Tailwind (External Factor):** The COVID-19 pandemic also served as a **tailwind** by accelerating the need for local businesses to adopt digital solutions, making remote and virtual customer interactions essential, which drove demand for Thryv's cloud-based platform.
13. **Continued Headwind (The Drag):** The most significant **headwind** has been the ongoing decline of its original **Marketing Services** segment (the Yellow Pages business), which still accounts for a large portion of its revenue but has been steadily shrinking and requires a difficult, multi-year transition.
14. **Current Strategy and Future:** To deal with this, Thryv has committed to a plan to fully phase out the Marketing Services business by 2028 and become a pure-play SaaS company. This transition is challenging, however, and has resulted in issues like shareholder skepticism, a significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge, and a recent SEC inquiry related to its client conversion strategy.

## Moat Analysis

Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) has built its competitive advantage, or "moat," by successfully transitioning a legacy business with deep small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) relationships into an all-in-one SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. The moat is less about a single revolutionary technology and more about **high customer switching costs** and a unique distribution advantage.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and differentiators:

### 1. Unique Differentiating Position (The All-in-One Advantage)

*   **Single, Comprehensive Platform:** Thryv's core difference is its "do-it-all" software platform, which bundles multiple essential functions like customer relationship management (CRM), online scheduling, marketing automation, and payment processing (ThryvPay) into one solution.
*   **Targeted Simplicity:** This all-in-one design is specifically tailored for local small businesses (like plumbers or local service providers) who do not have the time, budget, or technical knowledge to stitch together five or six separate, specialized software tools.
*   **Efficiency for the SMB Owner:** By consolidating these tools, Thryv helps its clients centralize their operations, communication, and customer data, giving small business owners a streamlined workflow and freeing up valuable time.

### 2. Special Pricing Power and Market Position

*   **Demonstrated Pricing Power:** The company shows pricing power, evidenced by a **19% year-over-year increase in SaaS Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)** in recent quarters, suggesting customers are willing to spend more because they perceive the integrated platform as a superior value.
*   **Value-Driven Pricing Model:** Thryv uses a location-based pricing model rather than the common per-user model, which makes the solution cost-effective for small businesses with several employees operating from a single location.
*   **ThryvPay for Cost Advantage:** Its payment processing feature, ThryvPay, includes the ability for small businesses to automatically charge a small convenience fee to the customer, which helps the business owner offset or eliminate their own processing costs—a direct and compelling financial incentive that competitors may not offer.

### 3. Reason for Growth and Historical Advantage

*   **Legacy Distribution Channel:** Thryv's roots trace back to the former Yellow Pages business (through its Marketing Services segment), which is the primary reason for its initial growth and large customer base.
*   **An Efficient Client Acquisition Engine:** The declining legacy Marketing Services segment (print and digital ads) serves as a ready-made, highly efficient sales pipeline to cross-sell the high-growth SaaS platform to existing, long-standing SMB clients, many of whom have trusted the company for decades.
*   **Strategic Transformation:** The company's growth is driven by a successful strategic shift, replacing declining print revenue with high-margin, recurring SaaS revenue, turning a traditional business into a modern software company.

### 4. Customer Stickiness, Recurring Contracts, and Displacement

*   **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The core business is subscription-based, providing highly desirable **recurring revenue**. The customer contracts are sticky, demonstrated by a Net Revenue Retention (NRR) rate of 94% (as of Q3 2025), which means customers are, on average, retaining or slightly growing their spending.
*   **High Switching Costs (The True Moat):** Once a small business begins running its entire operation—CRM, scheduling, invoicing, and marketing—through a single platform, the cost, time, and effort required to move to a new system is substantial. This deep integration is a major deterrent for customers to switch, creating a strong moat.
*   **Displacement by Capital:** While a well-capitalized competitor (like a tech giant) could build a similar product, they would find it difficult to displace Thryv easily because they would have to overcome the **high switching costs** and replicate the **decades-long, trusted sales relationship** with millions of local SMBs that Thryv inherited from its legacy business.

### 5. Moat Creation and Investment in R&D

*   **Constant Innovation (R&D):** The company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge. It is actively investing in **R&D** and strategic acquisitions (like Keap) to expand features and defend against competitors.
*   **AI-Driven Upgrades:** Thryv is integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the platform's value, for instance, by offering AI-generated social media content to help time-strapped small business owners manage their digital presence more easily, which in turn boosts customer spending (ARPU).
*   **Ecosystem Moat:** The company is intentionally creating an ecosystem where the value of the platform increases with the use of each additional tool (e.g., using scheduling leads to in-platform payments, which feeds data to the CRM). This product-led upselling strategy strengthens the moat by further integrating the platform into the client's day-to-day operations.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) are primarily centered on its ongoing transformation from a legacy marketing services provider to a pure-play Software as a Service (SaaS) company.

### Near-Term Catalysts (6-12 Months)

1.  **Accelerated SaaS Revenue and Margin Growth:** The company's core SaaS business is the main driver, with third-quarter 2025 revenue increasing by 33% year-over-year and SaaS Adjusted Gross Margin improving to 73.0%. Continued strong quarterly growth in this high-margin segment should improve investor confidence and stock valuation.
2.  **Improved Management Execution:** CEO Joe Walsh acknowledged that the slight miss on Q3 2025 SaaS guidance was due to "purely an execution issue" on their part, not external economic factors. A swift and demonstrable improvement in sales execution in the upcoming quarters would directly address a key recent investor concern and serve as a major near-term catalyst.
3.  **Capitalizing on Existing Customer Base (ARPU):** The strategy to increase the average revenue per user (ARPU) is working, with SaaS monthly ARPU expanding 19% year-over-year in Q3 2025. This growth, driven by selling more products and services to current customers, is an immediate and efficient path to higher revenue and a catalyst for the stock price.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)

1.  **Full Transition to Pure-Play SaaS Model:** The company is strategically focused on exiting its lower-margin Marketing Services segment by 2028, turning the business into a streamlined, high-growth SaaS platform. Successful completion of this transformation and the eventual removal of the "drag" from the legacy business should lead to a higher valuation multiples comparable to pure SaaS peers.
2.  **Strategic Focus on Higher-Value Clients:** Management is targeting slightly larger businesses, which they state are "less churn-prone and offer better margins." This focus on larger customers is a long-term strategy to improve the platform's Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) and reduce customer attrition, creating more stable and profitable growth.
3.  **Platform Expansion through Innovation and M&A:** The company continues to invest in new features, including the integration of AI-driven tools (like social captioning and review responses) and new vertical-specific offerings ("Thryv for HVAC"). Furthermore, strategic acquisitions, such as the addition of Keap for email marketing, are expanding the platform's capabilities and its customer base for future upsell.
4.  **Strengthening Financial Position through Deleveraging:** The consistent generation of free cash flow, reported at \$22 million in Q3 2025, is being used to pay down debt and deleverage the business. Management explicitly states this is "positioning us with a stronger balance sheet," which is a long-term catalyst for financial stability and reduced interest expense.

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Catalysts

*   **CEO Joe Walsh on Strategy:** Management's 2025 strategy is centered on "deepening relationships with our existing customers" and "capitalizing on the opportunities AI gives our team to power small business growth," which they are measuring through the rise in ARPU.
*   **CEO Joe Walsh on Revenue Potential:** The CEO noted in a recent call, "We could still take this business from whatever it is, a little less than \$500 million revenue we're running at right now to \$800 or \$900 million revenue just by doing what we've talked about, growing the ARPU in the base."
*   **Focus on Profitability:** The management team is committed to transitioning from a "capital-intensive growth model to a more sustainable, cash-generative framework," highlighted by the generation of net income and free cash flow.

## Management Incentive

The management incentive and compensation structure for Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) appears to be designed with significant mechanisms to align the interests of its executives and directors with those of its shareholders.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

1.  **High Insider Ownership (Alignment with Shareholders):** Directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially owned **10.8%** of the common stock as of an early 2023 filing, which is a strong level of insider holding. Furthermore, the CEO and an affiliated major shareholder previously held approximately **55.3%** of the common stock, indicating a high degree of control and vested interest in long-term stock value.

2.  **Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines (Increased Commitment):** The company mandates that its CEO own common stock equal to **six times (6x)** their base salary, while other Executive Committee members must own **three times (3x)** their base salary. Non-Employee Directors are also required to own stock equal to **three times (3x)** their annual cash retainer.

3.  **Equity Retention Requirements (Long-Term Focus):** Until the mandatory ownership guidelines are met, executives and directors are required to retain **50%** of the net shares acquired from their compensatory equity awards (like stock options, RSUs, and PSUs) granted since 2022. This locks in a portion of their wealth to the company's long-term stock performance.

4.  **Compensation Structure is Heavily Equity-Weighted (Pay-for-Performance):** The compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is largely comprised of short-term incentive pay linked to financial performance and **long-term equity incentive compensation** (stock awards). For example, the CEO's total compensation for 2024 fiscal year included $3.0 million in equity compared to $2.41 million in total cash compensation, demonstrating a greater emphasis on share value creation than on fixed salary.

5.  **Performance-Based Incentives (Shareholder Return Focus):** The compensation structure ties annual incentive payouts to the "overachievement of target incentive and performance against **pre-determined Company financial performance measures**." The long-term incentive plan includes **performance awards** with vesting conditions that can be tied to metrics like Total Shareholder Return (TSR), which directly aligns management's reward with the return experienced by common stockholders.

### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

Based on the analysis of the DEF 14A filings and related data, **Thryv Holdings, Inc. management has substantial incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

The strong conclusion is supported by:
*   **High Insider Ownership:** The management and directors have a material stake in the company's success.
*   **Mandatory Ownership Multiples:** The high stock ownership requirements (6x base salary for the CEO) and the **50% retention rules** ensure that their personal wealth is heavily dependent on sustained increases in the company's stock price.
*   **Equity-Heavy Compensation:** The large proportion of compensation delivered in equity, particularly performance-based awards, directly links executive reward to the creation of shareholder value over the long term.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY) following major news, here is an analysis of its price history and technical position.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock experienced a significant price drop on October 30, 2025, closing as low as $7.86, which is dramatically outside its previous 52-week range. The established 52-week trading range before this drop was between a high of **$20.92** and a low of **$10.03**.

2.  **Trading Low (Technical Analysis):** The stock is currently trading at a **new 52-week low**, which is a highly bearish technical signal and indicates it is trading at a "low" based on its yearly history. The price of $7.86 is trading approximately **21.6% below** the previous 52-week low of $10.03, signifying a major breach of previous support levels.

3.  **Technical Indicators:** From a technical perspective, the stock is showing negative signals, including "sell signals" from both short-term and long-term Moving Averages, as the price is significantly below its 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages.

4.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Since the stock price recently dropped to $7.86, it is effectively **0% above** its *current* 52-week low, as the current price now represents the new low for the period.

5.  **Reason for Big Drop (Bigly Down):** The stock fell more than 25% (one source reported a 32.86% decline) on October 30, 2025, following the release of disappointing third-quarter results. This massive drop was driven by investor concerns after the company reported Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues that missed its guidance and adjusted EBITDA that fell below the guided mid-point.

6.  **Underlying Concern:** Analysts linked the poor performance to concerns about the SaaS revenue growth decelerating to single digits in the fiscal year 2026, overshadowing otherwise strong Marketing Services revenues. Despite the drop, some analysts still maintained a "Buy" rating, viewing the stock as "much too cheap" for a profitable SaaS segment, even with a reduced price target.

## Long Thesis

Thryv is a rapidly transforming company that is shifting from a dying print business (Yellow Pages) into a highly profitable, cloud-based software provider for local small businesses. The long-term bull case is that investors are currently pricing the company like a collapsing old media firm, but its core software division is growing fast (over 30% annually) and has excellent profit margins (over 70%). The near-term growth driver is unique: Thryv is successfully cross-selling its comprehensive 'all-in-one' software platform to its millions of existing customers inherited from the legacy business. Because this software handles everything from scheduling and payments to customer management, it’s extremely sticky, driving up the revenue it earns from each client (ARPU). In the long term, by 2028, the company plans to completely shed the shrinking, lower-margin print business. Once this transition is complete and the 'drag' is removed, the market will recognize Thryv as a pure-play, high-growth SaaS company with high switching costs, leading to a much higher stock valuation reflective of its true software peers. The current deeply discounted stock price, caused by a recent quarterly miss, offers a strong entry point for this successful transformation story, supported by management actively paying down debt.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions for this bull case are: 1) The growth and high profit margins of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) division must accelerate or at least maintain their current rate (30%+ YoY). 2) Management must successfully execute the gradual wind-down of the legacy print business without triggering mass customer churn or excessive cost increases. 3) The 'all-in-one' platform must continue to successfully fend off competition and increase the average spending per customer (ARPU) by integrating new features, like AI. 4) The company must continue to generate significant free cash flow and actively use it to pay down debt, strengthening the balance sheet and reducing financial risk. 5) The recent sales execution issues cited by management must be resolved quickly.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and points of weakness in the bullish thesis for Thryv Holdings, Inc. (THRY), based on recent financial and operational data.

## **Bear Case Thesis: The Transition is Margin-Dilutive, and Organic SaaS Growth is Subpar**

The long thesis overstates the health and organic growth of the core Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business, while underestimating the drag and execution risk associated with the legacy wind-down and a fiercely competitive landscape. The company's reliance on acquired growth and the negative net revenue retention (NRR) signal that the product is currently not "extremely sticky," threatening the long-term valuation arbitrage story.

---

### **Critique and Identification of Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **SaaS Growth is Misleading and Non-Organic:** While the reported SaaS revenue growth of 33% year-over-year (YoY) sounds strong, this figure is heavily buoyed by the Keap acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the organic core SaaS growth is significantly lower at 14% YoY, which fundamentally challenges the bull case assumption that the segment will "accelerate or at least maintain their current rate (30%+ YoY)."
2.  **SaaS is Not "Highly Profitable" on an EBITDA Basis:** The bull case touts the SaaS division as "highly profitable," but the Q3 2025 SaaS Adjusted EBITDA margin was only 16.9%. In contrast, the "dying, lower-margin" Marketing Services segment had a higher Adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% in the same quarter, meaning the planned transition is currently a dilutive event to the overall profitability of the company.
3.  **The "Extremely Sticky" Claim is Contradicted by Churn:** The most significant flaw is the poor Seasoned Net Revenue Retention (NRR), which stood at 94% in Q3 2025. An NRR below 100% means existing customers are either churning or spending less than the remaining customers are increasing their spend, directly refuting the core assumption that the platform is "extremely sticky" and successfully driving up Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) at a healthy rate.
4.  **Execution Risk and Regulatory Uncertainty:** The recent quarterly miss was attributed to "challenges in execution," and a major unmentioned risk is the ongoing cooperation with an **SEC Division of Enforcement subpoena** related to client platform conversion. This introduces significant financial, legal, and reputational risk that can divert management attention and capital away from the necessary SaaS transition and debt paydown efforts.
5.  **Competitive Pressure and Commoditization:** The "all-in-one" platform must successfully fend off both specialized "best-of-breed" tools (like HubSpot for CRM/marketing or Square for payments) and lower-cost competitors (like Zoho), many of which offer a free tier. The company is positioned in a highly competitive middle ground where competitors can peel off customers with better point solutions or less complex, more user-friendly interfaces.
6.  **Legacy Customer Migration Risk is High:** The transition of legacy print/digital marketing clients to the modern SaaS platform is specifically causing "temporary noise in SaaS metrics" and is the primary cause for the dip in NRR. This indicates the risk of mass customer churn or a permanent lowering of the average customer quality is material and could derail the projected 2028 "pure-play" valuation uplift.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the analysis and the new data from the search results, the following are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further. The key is to fully reconcile the alarming recent financial metrics (14% organic growth, 94% NRR in Q3) with the long-term, more positive management guidance.

### Next Steps and Important Questions for Further Investigation

#### **1. Reconcile Recent Decline with Long-Term SaaS Targets**
*   **The Question:** Why was the *Q3 2025* organic SaaS growth only 14% and NRR 94%, when the **Management's Medium-Term Outlook** projects organic growth of $\sim 20\%$ and NRR was recently reported at $103\%$ in Q2 2025?
*   **The Action:** Specifically search for the causes of the Q3 *deceleration* in organic growth and the dip in NRR, as management previously attributed the Q3 miss to "execution issues." Investigate if the $94\%$ NRR is a *seasoned* NRR (as NRR can vary by cohort). The resolution of this gap is critical to the bull case.

#### **2. Quantify the Financial Risk of the SEC Subpoena**
*   **The Question:** The SEC subpoena is related to the "strategic conversion" of legacy Marketing Services clients to the SaaS platform. What are the potential financial and legal liabilities associated with this inquiry, including the cost of compliance, potential fines, and any required changes to their sales practices?
*   **The Action:** Search for analyst commentary, legal expert opinions, or any subsequent company filings (beyond the 8-K) that attempt to *quantify* the financial impact or estimate a timeline for the resolution of the SEC Division of Enforcement subpoena.

#### **3. Confirm Debt Refinancing and Financial Headroom**
*   **The Question:** Management is focused on deleveraging, but a significant portion of the *Prior Term Loan* was due in March 2026. Did the company successfully refinance this, and what is the effective *cost of debt* (interest rate) on the remaining debt?
*   **The Action:** Look for a more recent update (post-June 2024 filing) on the total debt and whether the rumored **private credit refinancing** for the remaining syndicated debt was completed, as this materially affects future interest expense and free cash flow.

#### **4. Deep Dive into the SaaS Profitability Roadmap**
*   **The Question:** The legacy Marketing Services business (25% Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q3 2025) is currently *more* profitable than the core SaaS business (17% Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q3 2025). What specific actions are planned, and how is management projecting to reach the medium-term SaaS Adjusted EBITDA margin goal of $\sim 20\%$ and an eventual margin of $25\%$ or higher, comparable to pure-play peers?
*   **The Action:** Search for specific details on operating expense rationalization in the SaaS segment (e.g., Sales & Marketing efficiency, R\&D spending plans, realization of Keap synergies) that will drive the margin expansion.

#### **5. Evaluate the "All-in-One" Product Moat vs. Competition**
*   **The Question:** How does the combined Thryv/Keap platform truly stack up against "best-of-breed" competitors like HubSpot (for CRM/Marketing) or Square (for Payments/Scheduling) for the $4,000-\$8,000$ ARPU target customer?
*   **The Action:** Search for recent, independent third-party reviews, competitive teardowns, or user forums that discuss the **functionality and usability** of the combined Keap automation and Thryv platform, specifically in areas like the newly launched vertical-specific offerings (e.g., "Thryv for HVAC"). This assesses the true strength of the "moat."
