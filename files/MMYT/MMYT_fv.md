This valuation of MakeMyTrip Limited (MMYT) stock is conducted using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, projecting Net Income as a proxy for free cash flow to equity, based on the principle of conservative business engine analysis and management commentary from the latest SEC filings and earnings call transcripts.

All financial figures are in millions of US Dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted. MMYT’s fiscal year (FY) ends on March 31.

## 1. Current Financial Position (as of Dec 31, 2025)

The base financial figures are drawn from the latest available SEC filings (Q3 FY26 6-K and related reports).

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source/Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $830.0 | Cash, cash equivalents, and term deposits (Q3 FY26) [cite: 4 in step 2] |
| **Total Debt (to subtract)** | $230.0 | Principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, the most direct interest-bearing debt to subtract. |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | $98.85$ million | Calculated: Q3 FY26 Adjusted Net Profit ($51.4M) / Adjusted Diluted EPS ($0.52) [cite: 4, 5 in step 3] |
| **FY 2025 Revenue (Base)** | $978.0$ | Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2025 (from search steps) |
| **Current Stock Price (approx.)** | $56.25$ | Approximate price as of Feb 13, 2026. |

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (FY2026 - FY2030)

MMYT's business engine is driven by three key factors based on management commentary:
1.  **Strong underlying demand in the Indian travel market,** evidenced by 20%+ volume growth in key segments like Hotels and Packages, despite temporary macro headwinds in domestic air travel [cite: 3, 4, 10 in step 3].
2.  **Increased penetration into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities** in India, broadening the customer base [cite: 1, 3 in step 3].
3.  **Expansion into higher-margin segments** such as Hotels & Packages, Bus Ticketing, and rapidly scaling Ancillaries (insurance, tours & activities), which showed +45.5% YoY adjusted margin growth in Q3 FY26 [cite: 10 in step 3].

We will use a conservative top-down revenue growth projection that reflects the high underlying volume growth but bakes in a rapid deceleration due to market maturity and conservative assumptions.

**Revenue Engine Assumptions:**
*   **FY 2026 (Projection):** The TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) revenue ended December 31, 2025, was approximately $1,040M. For a full-year FY26 projection, we use a conservative 18% growth over the FY25 base, reflecting strong momentum but caution on short-term air constraints.
*   **Decay:** The rate is reduced by 3-2% annually, moving toward a conservative terminal rate, acknowledging a maturing, but still growing, market dominance.

| Fiscal Year (Ends Mar 31) | Projected Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2025 (Actual Base)** | N/A | $978.0$ |
| **FY2026** | 18.0% | $1,154.0$ |
| **FY2027** | 15.0% | $1,327.1$ |
| **FY2028** | 12.0% | $1,475.2$ |
| **FY2029** | 10.0% | $1,622.7$ |
| **FY2030** | 8.0% | $1,752.5$ |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projection

The company's reported Net Income (IFRS) is highly volatile due to large non-cash adjustments, primarily the non-cash interest expense on zero-coupon convertible notes [cite: 5, 7, 11 in step 3]. However, the core operating business shows improving profitability, with Adjusted Operating Margin rising to 1.82% of Gross Bookings in Q3 FY26 [cite: 4 in step 3].

*   **Conservative Net Income Margin (Long-Term):** We use a highly conservative Net Income Margin of **6.0%**. This is below the FY25 reported Net Income Margin of 9.71% [cite: 7 in step 4] and reflects potential future volatility and increased marketing spend (5.6% of GBV in Q3 FY26) [cite: 4 in step 3].
*   **ROIC Assumption:** We will assume a conservative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **10.0%** on retained cash, which is a conservative midpoint of the reported TTM figures (6.12% to 18.04%) [cite: 1, 2 in step 4].

The rule is applied as: Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year (at 6.0% margin) + ROIC * (Net Income from previous year that went into cash).

### Projected Net Income Calculation

| Fiscal Year | Projected Revenue | Net Income (6.0% Margin) | ROIC on Prior Year NI | Total Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2025 (Base)** | $978.0$ | $58.7$ *(Used for ROIC calc)* | N/A | **$95.0$** |
| **FY2026** | $1,154.0$ | $69.2$ | $9.50$ *(10.0% of $95.0)* | **$78.7$** |
| **FY2027** | $1,327.1$ | $79.6$ | $7.87$ *(10.0% of $78.7)* | **$87.5$** |
| **FY2028** | $1,475.2$ | $88.5$ | $8.75$ *(10.0% of $87.5)* | **$97.3$** |
| **FY2029** | $1,622.7$ | $97.4$ | $9.73$ *(10.0% of $97.3)* | **$107.1$** |
| **FY2030** | $1,752.5$ | $105.2$ | $10.71$ *(10.0% of $107.1)* | **$115.9$** |

*Note: For FY2026 ROIC, we use the actual FY2025 Net Income of $95.0M for a conservative ROIC addition.*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### DCF Assumptions (Conservative)

| Metric | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | 10.0% | Conservative rate for a high-growth/high-volatility technology stock, higher than WACC estimates (6.91%-9.01%) [cite: 1, 2 in step 4]. |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (g)** | 2.5% | Slightly above long-term inflation, highly conservative for a dominant player in the fast-growing Indian market. |

### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (Gordan Growth Model)

Terminal Cash Flow = FY2030 Net Income * (1 + g) = $115.9$ * (1 + 0.025) = $118.8$ million
Terminal Value = Terminal Cash Flow / (r - g) = $118.8 / (0.10 - 0.025)$ = $1,584.0$ million

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Fiscal Year | Projected Net Income (NI) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (PV) of NI |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2026 (t=1)** | $78.7$ | $0.909$ | $71.5$ |
| **FY2027 (t=2)** | $87.5$ | $0.826$ | $72.3$ |
| **FY2028 (t=3)** | $97.3$ | $0.751$ | $73.1$ |
| **FY2029 (t=4)** | $107.1$ | $0.683$ | $73.1$ |
| **FY2030 (t=5)** | $115.9$ | $0.621$ | $72.0$ |
| **Terminal Value (t=5)** | $1,584.0$ | $0.621$ | $983.8$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$1,345.8$** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :---: |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Equity Value)** | $1,345.8$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | $+830.0$ |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $-230.0$ |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$1,945.8$** |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | $98.85$ million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$19.68$** |

## Fair Value and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :---: |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$19.68** |
| **Current Market Price (approx.)** | **$56.25** |

### Justification for the Difference

The calculated Fair Value of **$19.68** is significantly lower than the current market price of **$56.25**. This suggests that the market is making far more aggressive assumptions about MMYT's future growth and/or profitability than this conservative DCF model.

**Reasons for the Valuation Disparity (Why the Market is More Optimistic):**

1.  **Market is Pricing in Higher Growth/Longer Runway:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** Revenue growth is decelerated quickly from 18% (FY26) down to 8% (FY30) with a conservative terminal growth of 2.5%.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market is likely pricing in a **20-25% growth rate** for the next 5+ years, reflecting the overall high growth and massive potential of the Indian travel market, driven by rising disposable incomes and the shift from unorganized to organized/online booking. A more aggressive model with 20% growth for the first three years and a 4.0% terminal rate would yield a higher value.

2.  **Market is Using Higher Long-Term Margins:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** A conservative long-term Net Income Margin of **6.0%**.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market may be assuming the company can achieve margins in line with more mature global OTA peers like **Booking Holdings (PCLN)** or **Expedia (EXPE)**, whose operating margins are substantially higher. If MMYT's Adjusted Operating Margin (currently ~1.82% of Gross Bookings) can translate into a 10%-12% Net Income Margin in the long term through aggressive operating leverage, the valuation would increase substantially. The market is betting on the high-margin segment (Hotels/Packages/Ancillaries) becoming a much larger part of the mix, leading to massive margin expansion.

3.  **Market Valuation of Cash and Debt (Non-Cash vs. Cash Flow):**
    *   The market is likely ignoring the non-cash interest accounting effect on reported Net Income and valuing the company based on a significantly higher Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) that more closely resembles the Adjusted Net Profit ($51.4M in Q3 FY26 alone).
    *   The market is also implicitly placing a higher value on the **$830M of Cash** by assuming a higher deployment ROIC or a strategic value to the cash horde for acquisitions.

**Conclusion:**
The conservative model provides a large Margin of Safety and indicates that the current stock price implies a scenario of sustained, high-double-digit growth (20%+) and a much higher long-term profitability (10%+ Net Margin) than our conservative assumption of 6.0%. **The market is clearly valuing MMYT as a compounding high-growth technology stock in a massive emerging market (India), betting on a long runway of market share capture and margin expansion over the next decade.** Our valuation is fundamentally different from the market's due to the mandated conservatism in growth and margin assumptions.
