## 1. Initial Financial Data

The initial financial data is extracted from the latest available SEC filings (Form 6-K and 20-F) as of the current date (November 2, 2025).

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source (Latest Filings) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$80.00** | Various Market Data (As of Oct 2025) [cite: 1, 4 - from step 2] |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **95.38 Million** | 6-K (Q1 FY2026, July 22, 2025) |
| **Total Liquid Cash (C)** | **$835.4 Million** | 6-K (Q2 FY2026, Sept 30, 2025): Cash & equiv. + term deposits |
| **Total Debt (D)** | **$1,100.0 Million** | 6-K (Q2 FY2026): Debt portion of convertible notes due 2030 [cite: 12 - from step 3] |

### Net Cash / (Net Debt) Calculation
$$Net \ Cash / (Net \ Debt) = C - D$$
$$Net \ Cash / (Net \ Debt) = \$835.4 \ M - \$1,100.0 \ M = (\$264.6 \ Million)$$

**Conclusion:** MakeMyTrip has a net debt position of **$264.6 million**, primarily driven by the significant **$1.1 billion** in zero-coupon convertible notes recognized as debt on the balance sheet following the repurchase of Class B shares from Trip.com in July 2025 [cite: 12 - from step 3, 8].

## 2. Business Engine and Financial Projections

### Business Engine Analysis (Based on Last 4 Earnings Calls)

MakeMyTrip's growth is fundamentally driven by the robust, long-term secular growth of the Indian travel and tourism market [cite: 4 - from step 3].

1.  **Macro Tailwinds:** Management consistently points to rising disposable income, significant infrastructure upgrades, and a fundamental shift in consumer behavior to spend more on "experiential travel activities" as key drivers [cite: 4 - from step 3, 8].
2.  **Core Segments & Margin Expansion:** The company's strategy is focused on growing its higher-margin segment, Hotels and Packages, and expanding its presence in the fast-growing **International Outbound** market (International Air Ticketing revenue was up over 33% and International Hotels revenue up over 65% in FY2025). This segment diversification and mix-shift toward international/packages allows for improved margins.
3.  **Operating Leverage:** Management is committed to "driving operational efficiency and leveraging our fixed cost base". This is evidenced by the Adjusted Operating Margin expanding from 1.56% of Gross Bookings in FY2024 to 1.71% in FY2025 (FYE March 31) [cite: 6 - from step 2].

The model will project revenue growth and net margin expansion based on these drivers, assuming the long-term trend holds despite short-term "exceptional external events" that impacted Q1 FY2026 [cite: 4 - from step 3, 8]. **Adjusted Net Profit** (a non-IFRS metric closely tracked by management and reflecting normalized profitability) is used as the proxy for annual operating cash flow in an asset-light model.

### Revenue and Margin Projections (USD Millions)

| Year | Revenue (USD M) (R) | Y-o-Y Growth Rate | Adjusted Net Profit Margin (NPM) | Net Income / Cash Flow (NI) | Prior Year Cash Balance (C-1) | ROIC % | ROIC Income (R) | Projected Net Income (NI + R) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Actual/Base)** | $978.3 | 25.0% | 18.2% | **$178.2** | N/A | N/A | N/A | **$178.2** |
| **FY2026 (Projection)** | $1,174.0 | 20.0% | 18.5% | $217.2 | $835.4 | 4.0% | $33.4 | **$250.6** |
| **FY2027** | $1,385.3 | 18.0% | 19.0% | $263.2 | $1,086.0 | 4.0% | $43.4 | **$306.6** |
| **FY2028** | $1,593.1 | 15.0% | 19.5% | $310.6 | $1,392.6 | 4.0% | $55.7 | **$366.3** |
| **FY2029** | $1,809.9 | 13.6% | 20.0% | $362.0 | $1,758.9 | 4.0% | $70.4 | **$432.4** |
| **FY2030** | $2,027.1 | 12.0% | 21.0% | $425.7 | $2,191.3 | 4.0% | $87.7 | **$513.4** |

***Note:** Revenue for FY2025 and Adjusted Net Profit Margin of 18.2% are calculated from the reported $978.3M Revenue and $178.2M Adjusted Net Profit for the year ended March 31, 2025.*

### Justification of Assumptions

*   **Revenue Growth Rate (20.0% to 12.0%):** A conservative tapering from the 25% Y-o-Y growth of FY2025 is assumed. The 20% for FY2026 is slightly conservative given the Q1 '26 slowdown, followed by moderation to a robust 12% terminal growth, reflecting India's status as an emerging market with massive long-term travel potential.
*   **Net Margin (18.2% to 21.0%):** An expansion of 280 basis points over six years (approx. 47 bps per year) is very conservative, given management's focus on operational leverage and the market-mix shift to high-margin segments like international and packages. This shows a commitment to profitability.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Since MMYT is asset-light, the accumulated cash is conservatively assumed to generate a **4.0%** return, which is a reasonable and conservative return for liquid/short-term, low-risk investments (e.g., term deposits/short-term bonds) that a company would utilize for its cash hoard.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This reflects a premium over a broad market average (e.g., 7-8%) due to the emerging market risk of India, but is also realistic for a high-growth, market-dominant technology company with a solid balance sheet (excluding the convertible note debt).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate - Very Conservative):** **3.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative long-term growth rate, lower than the long-term US GDP average, reflecting the eventual maturation of the Indian travel market and a reduction from the 12% final projected growth rate.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Free Cash Flow for a service company with minimal capital expenditure is proxied by the projected Net Income.

| Year | Projected Net Income (NI + R) (USD M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (USD M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $250.6 | 0.9174 | $229.9 |
| **2027** | $306.6 | 0.8417 | $257.9 |
| **2028** | $366.3 | 0.7722 | $282.9 |
| **2029** | $432.4 | 0.7084 | $306.3 |
| **2030** | $513.4 | 0.6499 | $333.7 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **$1,410.7** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030)

$$Terminal \ Value = \frac{Cash \ Flow_{2030} \times (1 + Terminal \ Growth \ Rate)}{Discount \ Rate - Terminal \ Growth \ Rate}$$

$$Terminal \ Value = \frac{\$513.4 \ M \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.09 - 0.03} = \frac{\$528.8 \ M}{0.06} = \$8,813.3 \ Million$$

### NPV of Terminal Value

$$NPV \ of \ Terminal \ Value = Terminal \ Value \times Discount \ Factor_{2030}$$

$$NPV \ of \ Terminal \ Value = \$8,813.3 \ M \times 0.6499 = \$5,727.8 \ Million$$

### Total NPV of Future Cash Flows

$$Total \ NPV = NPV \ of \ Projected \ Cash \ Flows + NPV \ of \ Terminal \ Value$$
$$Total \ NPV = \$1,410.7 \ M + \$5,727.8 \ M = \mathbf{\$7,138.5 \ Million}$$

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value of Stock Calculation

$$Fair \ Value \ of \ Equity = Total \ NPV + Current \ Liquid \ Cash - Total \ Debt$$
*Note: This formula is simplified to* $Fair \ Value \ of \ Equity = Total \ NPV + Net \ Cash / (Net \ Debt)$

$$Fair \ Value \ of \ Equity = \$7,138.5 \ M + (\$835.4 \ M - \$1,100.0 \ M)$$
$$Fair \ Value \ of \ Equity = \$7,138.5 \ M - \$264.6 \ M = \mathbf{\$6,873.9 \ Million}$$

### Fair Value Per Share

$$Fair \ Value \ Per \ Share = \frac{Fair \ Value \ of \ Equity}{Shares \ Outstanding}$$

$$Fair \ Value \ Per \ Share = \frac{\$6,873.9 \ Million}{95.38 \ Million} = \mathbf{\$72.07 \ per \ share}$$

## 5. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

### Fair Value Conclusion

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **$72.07** |
| **Current Market Price (MMYT)** | **$80.00** |

The calculated fair value of **$72.07** is **9.9% lower** than the current market price of $80.00.

### Justification of Discrepancy

The market is valuing MakeMyTrip at a slightly higher price than this conservative DCF model, implying the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future growth and/or profitability.

**Why the Market is More Optimistic (Likely Market Assumptions):**

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** The market may be using a higher terminal growth rate than the conservative **3.0%** used in this valuation. Given that India's GDP growth is projected to be robust for decades, the market likely models a terminal growth rate closer to **4.0% to 5.0%**, which would significantly increase the Terminal Value and the fair value per share.
    *   *Example:* A **4.0%** terminal growth rate and a **9.0%** discount rate yields a Fair Value Per Share of **$98.81**, which is significantly higher than the current market price. This suggests the market is expecting a **$72.07** value with a higher growth rate and/or a lower discount rate than used in this analysis.

2.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may view MMYT as a more stable, higher-quality asset in the emerging Indian market, justifying a lower risk premium and, therefore, a lower discount rate (e.g., **8.0%** instead of 9.0%). A lower discount rate inflates the present value of all future cash flows.
    *   *Example:* Using an **8.0%** discount rate and a **3.0%** terminal growth rate results in a Fair Value Per Share of **$92.15**, which is also higher than the current market price.

3.  **Higher Margin Expansion (Adjusted Net Profit Margin):** The market may be factoring in a faster and higher realization of operating leverage. Given the rapid growth in the high-margin International segment (Hotel revenue up 65%+ in FY2025), the market might anticipate the Adjusted Net Profit Margin reaching **25%** by FY2030, a figure that would substantially increase the final valuation.

**Conclusion:** The calculated fair value of **$72.07** is a reasonable, conservative estimate based on modest revenue growth moderation and slow margin expansion. The current market price of **$80.00** suggests the market is anticipating *either* a slightly higher long-term terminal growth rate (**~4.0%**) for the Indian travel sector *or* a slightly lower risk profile (lower Discount Rate) for MakeMyTrip than modeled in this conservative valuation.
