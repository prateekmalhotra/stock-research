## The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited (NTB) Stock Valuation

### 1. Initial Financial Data & Current Market Value

The valuation begins with key balance sheet data, the share count, and the most recent net income figures, all derived from the latest public disclosures.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions, unless noted) | Source/As of Date | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$46.67** | November 5, 2025 | Market value for comparison. |
| **Total Liquid Assets (Initial Cash)** | **$9,200 M** | September 30, 2025 | Represents "highly liquid position," including cash, bank deposits, reverse repurchase agreements, and liquid investments, which aligns with the required liquid assets definition. |
| **Total Debt** | **$100 M (Estimated)** | September 30, 2025 | A conservative estimate for non-deposit, interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., subordinated debt). The company has been redeeming subordinated debt, suggesting a low and manageable balance. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | **43.54 Million** | December 31, 2024 | Most recent explicit figure for common shares outstanding from the 2024 Annual Report. |
| **TTM Net Income** | **$227.8 M** | Q4 2024 - Q3 2025 | Sum of GAAP Net Income for the four most recent quarters: $59.6M (Q4 '24) + $53.8M (Q1 '25) + $53.3M (Q2 '25) + $61.1M (Q3 '25). |

### 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2026 - 2030)

The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited's core business engine is two-fold: **Net Interest Income (NII)** from its loan and investment portfolios, and **Non-Interest Income (NII)** from its wealth management (Trust, Private Banking, Asset Management) and fee-based banking services.

*   **Core Business Driver:** The bank primarily operates in well-capitalized, stable offshore markets (Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands/UK). Revenue growth is driven by **deposit costs/interest rate environment** (for NII) and **global wealth activity/asset flows** (for Non-Interest Income).
*   **Management Commentary & Trends (Q4 2024 - Q3 2025):**
    *   **NII/NIM:** NIM stabilized or increased slightly in recent quarters (e.g., 2.73% in Q3 2025, up from 2.64% in Q2 2025), driven by a lower cost of deposits and the benefit of a subordinated debt redemption. This indicates a shift from a rising deposit cost environment to a more favorable or stable one. Management commentary suggests an end to deposit cost increases as central banks reduce market rates.
    *   **Non-Interest Income:** Remains a stable and capital-efficient source of revenue, benefiting from increased card volume, fee income from asset management, and foreign exchange revenue. Q3 2025 Non-Interest Income was $60.6M ($153.3M total revenue - $92.7M NII).
    *   **Loan Growth:** The loan portfolio remained relatively flat at $4.5 billion at September 30, 2025. Management maintains a conservative credit posture, preferring residential mortgages.

#### Revenue Engine Assumptions (Conservative)

| Revenue Component | 2025 Estimate (Annualized) | 2026 - 2028 Growth | 2029 - 2030 Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Interest Income (NII)** | $368 M ($92M x 4) | **2.0%** | **1.5%** | Conservative growth assuming stable, high-rate environment subsides, partially offset by deployment of cash and higher yielding asset reinvestment. The Q3 2025 run rate ($92.7M) is used as the base. |
| **Non-Interest Income (NII)** | $242 M ($60.5M x 4) | **3.0%** | **2.5%** | Higher growth rate reflecting the stability and capital efficiency of the fee-income business (Trust, Asset Management). This is a core focus area for growth. The Q3 2025 implied run rate ($60.6M) is used as the base. |
| **Total Revenue** | **$610 M** | | | |

#### Projected Annual Revenue (USD Millions)

| Year | NII Projection | Non-Interest Income Projection | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TTM Q3 2025** | $365.1 M | $239.5 M | **$604.6 M** |
| **2026** | $372.4 M (2.0% Gr.) | $249.2 M (3.0% Gr.) | **$621.6 M** |
| **2027** | $379.8 M (2.0% Gr.) | $256.7 M (3.0% Gr.) | **$636.5 M** |
| **2028** | $387.4 M (2.0% Gr.) | $264.4 M (3.0% Gr.) | **$651.8 M** |
| **2029** | $393.2 M (1.5% Gr.) | $271.0 M (2.5% Gr.) | **$664.2 M** |
| **2030** | $399.1 M (1.5% Gr.) | $277.8 M (2.5% Gr.) | **$676.9 M** |

### 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

*   **Core Efficiency Ratio (Non-Interest Expense/Total Revenue):** The Q3 2025 Core Efficiency Ratio was **56.2%**. The core non-interest expense run rate has been relatively stable at around $88 million per quarter. I will use the **57.0%** Core Efficiency Ratio, which is slightly higher (more conservative) than the Q3 2025 figure to account for future investments and inflation.
*   **Income Tax Rate:** NTB's operating jurisdictions often have low or no corporate tax. I will assume a conservative effective tax rate of **15%** (slightly higher than a typical offshore bank's rate, but below the global minimum tax rate which is currently a risk for the industry).
*   **Net Income Margin:** Using the 57.0% core efficiency ratio and 15% tax rate provides a pro-forma net income margin: $(1 - 57.0\% \text{ Operating Expense}) \times (1 - 15\% \text{ Tax Rate}) = 36.55\%$. I will use a conservative net income margin of **35.0%** for the projections.

#### Projected Net Income and Accumulated Cash (USD Millions)

The user specifies a reinvestment assumption: *Net Income (NI) for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage based on the past to get additional income for the next year.*

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** NTB's core return on average tangible common equity (ROATCE) was 25.5% in Q3 2025. This is an extremely high return. For a conservative forward-looking ROIC on retained earnings, I will assume a significantly lower, but still robust, **Conservative ROIC of 5.0%** for all future years, based on the bank's ability to redeploy capital into high-quality, interest-earning assets.

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | NI from Operations (B) = A * 35% | Previous Year's Cash (C) | ROIC on Cash (D) = C * 5.0% | **Total Net Income (B + D)** | **Cash to Next Year (C + Total NI)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Run Rate)** | $604.6 | 35.0% | $211.6 | $9,200 (Initial) | $460.0 | **$671.6** | **$9,871.6** |
| **2026** | $621.6 | 35.0% | $217.6 | $9,871.6 | $493.6 | **$711.2** | **$10,582.8** |
| **2027** | $636.5 | 35.0% | $222.8 | $10,582.8 | $529.1 | **$751.9** | **$11,334.7** |
| **2028** | $651.8 | 35.0% | $228.1 | $11,334.7 | $566.7 | **$794.8** | **$12,129.5** |
| **2029** | $664.2 | 35.0% | $232.5 | $12,129.5 | $606.5 | **$839.0** | **$12,968.5** |
| **2030** | $676.9 | 35.0% | $236.9 | $12,968.5 | $648.4 | **$885.3** | **$13,853.8** |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

This valuation uses the projected net income as the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for the purposes of this specific DCF model structure requested.

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative WACC/Discount Rate for a profitable, low-beta (0.61), geographically diversified bank, acknowledging its offshore and regional bank risk profile.
*   **Maturity (Terminal) Rate (Conservative):** **3.0%**. This represents the long-term, stable, perpetuity growth rate for the entire business beyond 2030, a highly conservative figure given the bank's historical performance.

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (1/(1+0.10)^t) | **Net Present Value (NPV)** (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** (t=1) | $711.2 | 0.9091 | $646.6 |
| **2027** (t=2) | $751.9 | 0.8264 | $621.4 |
| **2028** (t=3) | $794.8 | 0.7513 | $597.1 |
| **2029** (t=4) | $839.0 | 0.6830 | $573.0 |
| **2030** (t=5) | $885.3 | 0.6209 | $549.7 |
| **Sum of Projected NPV (2026-2030)** | | | **$3,087.8 M** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)

The terminal value calculation uses the perpetual growth model:
$$
\text{Terminal Value (at end of 2030)} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2031}}}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Growth Rate}}
$$
$$
\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2031}} = \text{Projected Net Income}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate}) = \$885.3 \text{ M} \times (1 + 0.03) = \$911.96 \text{ M}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{\text{2030}} = \frac{\$911.96 \text{ M}}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{\$911.96 \text{ M}}{0.07} = \$13,028.0 \text{ M}
$$
$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value}_{\text{2030}} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{Year 5}} = \$13,028.0 \text{ M} \times 0.6209 = \mathbf{\$8,088.3 \text{ M}}
$$

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of Projected NPV (2026-2030) | $3,087.8 M |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $8,088.3 M |
| Current Total Liquid Assets | $9,200.0 M |
| **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$20,376.1 M** |
| Less: Total Debt | $100.0 M |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$20,276.1 M** |
| Divided by: Shares Outstanding | 43.54 M |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$465.71** |

### Fair Value Result and Justification

**Fair Value per Share: $465.71**
**Current Market Price: $46.67**

The calculated Fair Value of **$465.71** is significantly higher (nearly 10 times) than the Current Market Price of $46.67.

#### Justification for Disparity

The extreme difference between the calculated Fair Value and the Market Price stems entirely from the user's explicit model constraints, which are structurally unsuited for a bank's financial statements:

1.  **Treatment of Cash/Deposits:** The model requires treating **all liquid assets ($9.2 Billion)** as "Initial Cash" and carrying forward **all Net Income** as **retained cash** (which then generates further ROIC income). For a bank, the majority of "cash, bank deposits, and liquid investments" are directly offset by **Customer Deposits**, which are the bank's main source of funding (liabilities). The model effectively ignores the bank's core liability—customer deposits—in the Enterprise Value calculation.
    *   **Bank's Enterprise Value (EV) Calculation (Industry Standard):** EV typically focuses on Tangible Common Equity (TCE) or Tangible Book Value (TBV) plus the present value of future earnings, or uses a Residual Income Model.
    *   **Model's Impact:** By adding the full $9.2 billion of liquid assets and $13.8 billion of retained cash from Net Income, the model double-counts this capital, as it is largely funded by the excluded customer deposits (a liability).

2.  **Unrealistic Cash Accumulation and ROIC:** The model assumes $9,200 million of current cash and $4.6 billion of additional cash from NI by 2030, all generating a **5.0% ROIC** (which is treated as a form of cash flow). In reality, a bank's **total assets** (which are funded by liabilities, primarily customer deposits) generate its interest income, not just the retained net income.

**What the Market is Assuming (The Correct Model):**

The market is using a valuation that properly accounts for the bank's structure.

*   **Valuation Base:** The market is likely valuing NTB closer to its Tangible Book Value per Share (TBV) of **$25.06** (as of Q3 2025), plus a multiple for its high profitability (high ROATCE of 25.5%).
*   **Price-to-Tangible Book Value (P/TBV):** The current market value of $46.67 is a P/TBV multiple of approximately **1.86x** ($46.67 / $25.06). This is a realistic multiple for a highly profitable offshore bank with a high core ROATCE of over 25%.
*   **P/E Multiple:** The current P/E ratio is 9.91 (implied from the Q3 2025 earnings release data), which is reasonable for a regional bank.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated fair value is fundamentally flawed for a bank due to the constraints of the DCF model specified, which does not correctly incorporate a bank's balance sheet structure (deposits are liabilities, not debt to be subtracted from an enterprise value derived this way). The market price of **$46.67** is justified based on a strong valuation relative to its tangible book value ($25.06) and its high, peer-leading core profitability (ROATCE 25.5%).
