## Business Summary

NovaGold Resources Inc. is a mineral development company focused solely on advancing one major asset: the Donlin Gold Project in Alaska, USA, which is one of the world's largest undeveloped gold deposits. NovaGold’s business model is not based on selling gold today, but on demonstrating the future economic viability of this project by securing government permits and completing necessary engineering studies. The company operates in partnership with Barrick Gold, sharing the costs of development. Since NovaGold is not currently a producer, it generates almost no revenue from sales. Its success relies entirely on the gold market and the company's ability to raise capital from global institutional and retail investors who believe the massive mine will eventually be built and generate high profits.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is permitting risk, as the company is entirely reliant on obtaining crucial government approvals in the United States to start construction. These regulatory processes are lengthy, complex, and prone to delays or legal challenges, which push back the start date and increase expenses. Since NovaGold generates no income, it must repeatedly raise capital by issuing new shares, which dilutes the value and ownership stake of existing shareholders. The main long-term risks center on immense capital costs. Building a mine of this scale in a remote Alaskan location often results in massive cost overruns compared to initial estimates—a historical issue in the mining industry—which could make the project uneconomic. Furthermore, the future value of the entire company is dependent on the volatile global price of gold; if prices drop significantly, the expected profits diminish dramatically, potentially harming the company’s market position before a single ounce of gold is produced.

## Company History

NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG) is a Canadian gold exploration and development company whose history has been marked by a transition from a diversified explorer to a company singularly focused on developing one of the world’s largest and highest-grade gold deposits.

### The Company's Roots and Core Goal

1.  **Inception and Initial Focus:** NovaGold was founded in 1984 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, initially under the name NovaCan Mining Resources. Its goal was to explore and develop a variety of mineral properties across North America.

2.  **Early Operations:** In its early years, the company was able to develop and operate the small, low-grade Murray Brook Mine in Nova Scotia from 1989 to 1992, producing gold and silver.

3.  **The Singular Focus:** Today, the company’s entire strategy revolves around its flagship asset, the **Donlin Gold Project** in Alaska. NovaGold's main mission is to safely and responsibly develop and operate Donlin Gold to create significant long-term value for its shareholders.

4.  **The Donlin Gold Project's Significance:** The Donlin Gold Project is considered one of the largest known undeveloped gold deposits in the world, with approximately 39 million ounces of gold resources. Its high-grade nature means the rock contains a relatively large amount of gold, which can make for lower operating costs once the mine is running.

### Headwinds (Problems) and How NovaGold Dealt With Them

5.  **Operational Setbacks:** An early challenge was the Rock Creek Mine in Alaska, which the company defaulted on financial obligations for, forcing it to close shortly after its brief opening in 2008. This demonstrated the high risks involved in bringing new mines into production.

6.  **The Partnership Headwind:** For many years, a major challenge, which the company itself called a "headwind," was a strained or "fraught relationship" with its former 50/50 joint venture partner, Barrick Gold, over the development path for Donlin Gold. This disagreement created an **impass** and slowed the project's progress.

7.  **Innovative Solution: Strategic Asset Sales:** To focus on its core project and provide the necessary funding, NovaGold successfully sold its interest in the Galore Creek project for a significant amount (over $500 million) to a major mining company, providing substantial capital. This move streamlined the company, allowing it to put all its resources toward Donlin Gold.

8.  **The Ultimate Solution: A Pivotal Transaction (Present Day):** The most recent and decisive move to overcome the partnership challenge occurred in 2025. NovaGold, in a deal with Paulson Advisers LLC, acquired Barrick Gold's entire 50% stake, significantly increasing its own economic interest in the Donlin Gold Project from 50% to 60%.

9.  **Current Challenge: Financing:** The largest remaining hurdle is the significant cost required to build the mine, which is estimated to be approximately **$7.4 billion**. The company is a pre-production business, meaning it currently earns no revenue from mining and must secure large-scale funding for construction.

### Tailwinds (Fortunate Advantages) and Competitive Strengths

10. **Geographic Advantage:** The Donlin Gold project is located in Alaska, United States, which is considered a **politically stable** and mining-friendly jurisdiction, offering a more secure environment for investment than some other regions globally.

11. **Collaborative Approach:** To secure the necessary permits and social license to operate, NovaGold made a strategic decision to build strong, collaborative relationships with the local indigenous communities, including the Native Alaskan corporations who own the surface and subsurface rights to the land.

12. **Favorable Gold Market:** The project benefits from a **tailwind of rising gold prices**, which directly improves the project's economics and makes the massive construction cost more appealing to investors and lenders.

13. **New Strategic Partner:** The new partnership with Paulson Advisers LLC, a prominent gold-focused investor, has provided both substantial funding and a clear, unified path forward to advance the project quickly. This move removed the main partnership headwind and gave the company a strong direction.

14. **Current Status and Goal:** NovaGold is now positioned as a high-leverage gold company focused on advancing the Donlin Gold Project through the final stages of engineering and feasibility studies, with the ultimate goal of transitioning into one of the world’s major gold producers.

## Moat Analysis

NovaGold Resources Inc.'s (NG) moat is unique because the company is a **pre-production, development-stage business** focused almost entirely on a single, irreplaceable physical asset: the Donlin Gold project in Alaska. Its competitive advantage, or "moat," is therefore based on the exceptional quality and strategic position of this massive gold deposit, rather than on sales, technology, or network effects.

Here is an analysis of NovaGold's moat and differentiation:

1.  **World-Class Asset as the Moat:** The core of NovaGold's moat is the Donlin Gold project itself, which is considered one of the largest, highest-grade, and most prospective undeveloped open-pit gold deposits in the world. The combination of massive scale (approximately 39 million ounces of gold resources) and high grade (roughly double the industry average) in an open-pit setting is exceptionally rare.

2.  **Differentiation by Grade and Cost Advantage:** The high gold grade of the Donlin Gold deposit (about 2.24 grams per tonne, compared to an industry average of around 1.03 grams per tonne for similar deposits) is its primary technical differentiator. This grade advantage is expected to translate into significantly lower projected operating costs per ounce, which would position it in the lower half of the industry cost curve, giving it a powerful, defensible economic advantage once in production.

3.  **Jurisdictional Safety and Permitting:** A critical part of its differentiation is the project’s location in Alaska, a politically stable and established mining jurisdiction. This stability mitigates the high geopolitical risks common to large-scale mining projects in other parts of the world, providing a competitive edge that is nearly impossible for competitors with assets in less stable regions to replicate.

4.  **No Special Pricing Power (Commodity):** NovaGold does not have special pricing power because gold is a globally traded commodity, meaning its product sells at the prevailing market price. The company’s financial success is leveraged to the price of gold, but its unique asset only grants a *cost* advantage (higher profit margins), not the ability to set the selling price.

5.  **Customer and Contract Structure (Pre-Revenue):** Since NovaGold is a development-stage company, it does not have "customers" or sticky, recurring contracts in the traditional sense. Its "contracts" are primarily long-term joint venture agreements and property rights, with the current focus being on advancing feasibility and technical studies.

6.  **Barriers to Displacement by Capital:** The project's unique combination of scale, grade, and location acts as a significant barrier, making it hard to displace. While a company with more capital could attempt to build a new mine, they cannot replicate the natural resource endowment of Donlin Gold or easily acquire the federal and state permits that NovaGold has secured. The required massive initial capital investment, coupled with securing the necessary permits, acts as a barrier to entry that takes decades to overcome.

7.  **Historical and Ongoing Moat Creation:** The company's strategy has been to simplify its focus and de-risk the asset, which is the main source of its growth and valuation. This was demonstrated by consolidating its ownership interest in Donlin Gold and partnering with major institutional investors, thereby securing the necessary long-term financial backing to advance the project toward a production decision.

8.  **R&D and Innovation:** The company's moat is not built on network effects or high R&D spending in the typical technological sense. Its work focuses on resource conversion drilling, geotechnical engineering, and updating feasibility studies, which are standard, critical steps for converting a massive gold deposit into an operational mine. The company's edge comes from the *quality of the asset*, not constant technological innovation.

---

## Catalyst Analysis

NovaGold Resources Inc.'s stock catalysts are primarily tied to the development milestones of its core asset, the Donlin Gold project in Alaska, which it now owns 60% of in partnership with Paulson Advisers LLC (40%).

***

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-24 Months)

1.  **Advancing the Updated Feasibility Study:** The new ownership structure is focused on immediately moving forward with an updated Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) to replace the one from 2011, which management deems "out of date." The selection of a top-tier engineering firm is expected by the end of 2025, which will officially kick off the two-year study process.
2.  **Resource Conversion and Exploration Success:** The recently completed 15,000-meter drill program, and an approved additional 3,000 meters, is designed to convert resources into reserves and potentially expand the deposit. Positive, high-grade drill results can create market momentum and confirm the project's economics.
3.  **Strong Financial Position:** The company significantly strengthened its treasury by raising approximately \$234 million in net proceeds in Q2 2025. This large cash balance funds the ongoing development activities for the Donlin Gold project and reduces the near-term risk of needing to raise more capital.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Completion of the New Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS):** This is the most significant long-term milestone, targeted for the end of 2027, which will provide updated mine costs, construction plans, and a clearer economic picture for the massive Donlin Gold project.
2.  **Construction Decision and Project Financing:** Following a positive BFS, the decision by the partners to start mine construction would be a major catalyst, signaling that the project is moving from a development stage to a construction stage.
3.  **Gold Price Environment:** As a development-stage company with one of the world's largest unmined gold deposits, NovaGold's valuation is highly leveraged to the price of gold. Sustained increases in the gold price can enhance the project's future profitability and Net Present Value (NPV).
4.  **First Gold Production:** The ultimate long-term catalyst is the beginning of gold production, which is estimated by management to be early next decade, following an estimated four years of construction and engineering. The mine is expected to produce over one million ounces of gold per year over a 27-year mine life.

***

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Catalysts (Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Focus on the Donlin Gold Transaction:** In recent calls, CEO Greg Lang and Chairman Dr. Thomas S. Kaplan emphasized the acquisition of Barrick's stake as a pivotal moment that removed a previous "deadlock" and established an aligned partnership with Paulson Advisers.
*   **Tier One Asset Status:** Management repeatedly stresses that Donlin Gold is a "Tier One" asset due to its large size (39 million ounces) and high gold grade (more than double the industry average for similar open-pit projects), located in Alaska, a safe and secure jurisdiction.
*   **Core Strategy: Value Maximization through Development:** The explicit strategy is not to mine immediately, but to advance the project by completing the updated Feasibility Study with the new partner, thereby maximizing its value for shareholders by preparing it for a construction decision.
*   **Permitting and Community Relations:** Management highlights that the project has secured most of the necessary federal and state permits, and they maintain a strong focus on defending those permits and continuing a positive relationship with local Alaska Native Corporations.

Kaplan** becoming Chairman in 2011 and Lang becoming CEO in 2012, was a major organizational shift. This change was part of a Board strategy to "unlock the value of NovaGold's substantial assets" by refocusing *solely* on developing the Donlin Gold project and spinning off or selling other properties like NovaCopper (now Trilogy Metals) and the Galore Creek stake.

3.  **Track Record of Technical Delivery and Promises:** Management has delivered on technical and operational promises by executing highly successful, multi-year drill programs (e.g., 2020-2022, 2025) that yielded high-grade gold intercepts, which both partners (Barrick and NovaGold) acknowledged as some of the best for an open-pit gold project industry-wide. Furthermore, the company has consistently maintained a focus on financial discipline, often keeping its corporate general and administrative costs below guidance.

4.  **Board and Investor Alignment:** Chairman Dr. Thomas S. Kaplan is a high-profile natural resources investor and his firm, The Electrum Group, is the largest shareholder of NovaGold, indicating a significant and aligned vested interest in the company’s success. The Board and executive compensation model is heavily weighted toward long-term equity incentives, tying the management team's financial performance to the long-term appreciation of the stock price and the project's development.

5.  **Shareholder Popularity:** The management team, including CEO Lang and the Director nominees, was overwhelmingly re-elected at the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, reflecting strong and continued support from the investor base for the company's strategy.

### **Key Decisions and Future Strategy**

6.  **Transformational Donlin Gold Ownership Shift (June 2025):** The most significant recent decision was the $1 billion acquisition of Barrick Gold's 50% stake in Donlin Gold LLC. This move increases NovaGold's ownership to **60%** (up from 50%) and introduces a new, highly respected partner, **Paulson Advisers LLC**, which acquired a 40% interest.

7.  **New Strategic Partnership as Endorsement:** The new partnership with Paulson Advisers, led by "illustrious gold investor" John Paulson, is viewed by the company as a strong endorsement of the Donlin Gold project's value proposition. This deal solidifies a new partnership with a party that shares NovaGold’s long-term development vision.

8.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** NovaGold's singular and unwavering strategy is the **responsible and sustainable development of the Donlin Gold project** in Alaska, aiming for a construction decision. The Donlin Gold project is positioned as a **Tier-One** asset, one of the world's largest undeveloped gold deposits, with a projected 27-year mine life producing an average of approximately one million ounces of gold annually.

9.  **Immediate Project Advancement:** The immediate focus for the new 60/40 partnership is to advance the project to the next phase, which includes a revamped effort to update the **Feasibility Study** and to accelerate the drill program toward resource conversion and expansion. The management considers its success by measuring progress toward these key milestones and maintaining a strong treasury to fund its share of activities.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of NovaGold Resources Inc.'s (NG) proxy statements and executive compensation data, the following points address management incentives and alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation (NG)**

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Direct and Affiliated Ownership is Substantial:** Insider ownership by the leadership is a key factor in aligning interests. The CEO, Gregory Lang, holds an ownership stake of approximately 0.5% of the company's shares.
2.  **Major Shareholder Alignment:** The Chairman of the Board, Dr. Thomas Kaplan, is also the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of The Electrum Group LLC, whose affiliates hold a substantial number of Common Shares, further aligning a key board member's financial success with the company's stock performance.
3.  **High Equity Requirement for Directors:** Directors are required to be compensated with at least half of their annual retainer in Deferred Share Units (DSUs), which are converted into common shares only upon the director's retirement, mandating significant long-term equity exposure.

#### **Compensation Structure**

4.  **Compensation is Heavily "At Risk":** The executive compensation package is structured to target a high portion (between 58% and 65%) to be paid in long-term equity incentives (LTI) that vest over time. This makes a majority of their potential earnings directly dependent on the sustained long-term value of the stock.
5.  **Focus on Long-Term Project Development:** As a development-stage company, NovaGold's executive compensation does not rely on typical metrics like production or cash flow, which are irrelevant at this stage. Instead, performance is measured by progress in advancing its flagship Donlin Gold project, share price performance, and financial stewardship.
6.  **Anti-Hedging Policy in Place:** The company has adopted a "no hedging, no pledging" policy for directors and employees. This prevents them from selling call options or using other instruments to protect themselves from a decrease in the stock's value, ensuring they feel the full impact of any share price decline alongside other shareholders.

#### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

7.  **Strong Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest:** The compensation structure is strongly biased toward long-term equity, which is "at risk" and tied to the stock price and the successful development of the primary asset. This structure, combined with the anti-hedging policy and high equity participation, indicates a strong incentive for management to act in the best long-term interest of the shareholders, rather than just lining their own pockets through short-term gains.
8.  **Shareholder Support:** The executive compensation program has historically received strong advisory approval from shareholders, suggesting the company's owners generally view the incentives as reasonable and effective.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for NovaGold hinges entirely on successfully transitioning its single asset, the Donlin Gold Project in Alaska, from a vast undeveloped resource into one of the world's largest operating gold mines. Near-term growth is driven by reducing project risk: the company eliminated its internal deadlock by securing a new, highly aligned partner (Paulson Advisers) and raised significant cash to fund essential development work. This unified leadership will rapidly advance the updated Feasibility Study and drilling programs, validating the project's economics and pushing the stock price higher as key technical milestones are met. The long-term upside is based on the asset's exceptional quality. Donlin is massive and high-grade, promising high profit margins once operational. Successfully completing the Feasibility Study, securing the necessary $7.4 billion in construction financing, and eventually starting production in a politically stable region will transform the company into a major gold producer, unlocking immense value currently tied up in potential.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The global price of gold must remain high or continue to rise to justify the massive construction cost and ensure high future profitability. NovaGold and its partner must successfully secure the estimated $7.4 billion required for mine construction without excessively diluting existing shareholders. The updated Feasibility Study (expected by 2027) must confirm strong project economics and attractive costs. All necessary federal and state operating permits must remain valid and successfully defended against potential legal challenges. Finally, the estimated construction costs must not escalate dramatically, which would make the project uneconomic.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG) presents a narrative of transition and de-risking, but it significantly downplays or outright ignores critical financial, operational, and regulatory obstacles. The core flaws are centered on the sheer scale of the required capital, the significant permitting and legal uncertainty, and the inherent risk of a single, non-producing asset.

Here are the holes and faults in the NovaGold bull case:

### Critique and Identified Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Massive and Escalating Capital Cost Risk (Capex)**
    *   The project's estimated initial capital cost of **\$7.4 billion** is already one of the largest in the gold sector, and the company's CEO has publicly acknowledged that the forthcoming updated Feasibility Study will likely push this figure even higher due to industry-wide inflation.
    *   The long thesis's assumption that "estimated construction costs must not escalate dramatically" is already being challenged by management's own outlook, making the ultimate financing burden potentially unsustainable.

2.  **Severe Financing and Dilution Risk**
    *   NovaGold is a development-stage company with no operating cash flow. While the company recently secured approximately \$234 million in a share offering (net proceeds) for the recent Barrick buyout, its existing treasury remains only a fraction of the necessary \$7.4+ billion construction cost.
    *   Securing the multi-billion dollar construction financing will almost certainly require massive further equity issuances or high-cost debt financing, making the assumption of raising \$7.4 billion "without excessively diluting existing shareholders" highly unrealistic.

3.  **Permitting Instability and Regulatory Risk**
    *   The premise that "All necessary federal and state operating permits must remain valid and successfully defended" is actively compromised. Multiple, high-profile legal challenges from Tribal governments and environmental groups are currently moving through state and federal courts.
    *   A federal judge has already ruled that the project's Federal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was flawed for failing to consider a more catastrophic tailings spill scenario, directly challenging the integrity of a key federal authorization.

4.  **Extended Timeline and Purely Potential-Based Valuation**
    *   The "Near-term growth is driven by reducing project risk" narrative is relative; the updated Feasibility Study is projected to take about two years and cost \$80–\$100 million, with a production start not anticipated until the early next decade.
    *   This long timeline means the stock will continue to trade as a high-risk exploration/development vehicle for 5-7+ years, reliant purely on investor confidence and exploration successes, rather than proven financial metrics.

5.  **Partner and Alignment Mischaracterization**
    *   The prior "internal deadlock" was broken by the exit of Barrick Gold, a major global miner. While Paulson is aligned, Barrick's willingness to sell its 50% stake for \$1 billion can be interpreted as a lack of conviction from a world-class operator that it had other, more capital-efficient projects to focus on, raising questions about Donlin's economic viability at that scale.

---

### Bear Case Thesis for NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG)

The investment thesis for NovaGold is one of **Perpetual Development Risk**, where the market continually prices in the project's massive potential while ignoring the cumulative, recurring costs and unresolvable political-regulatory hurdles required to realize it.

1.  **Crippling Capital and Dilution Overhang:** The Donlin Gold Project is poised to be an **\$8+ billion** construction project, dwarfing NovaGold's current market capitalization and cash position. The company's only path to raising its multi-billion dollar share of capital will involve multiple, highly dilutive equity raises that will destroy shareholder value before a single ounce of commercial gold is produced.
2.  **Embedded Regulatory Risk from Unresolved Litigation:** Despite the claim of a "politically stable region," the project faces persistent and valid legal challenges to its core permits, including its water rights, gas pipeline, and environmental approvals, that will cause repeated, multi-year delays. These challenges force the company to spend tens of millions annually on *permit defense* rather than construction, extending the timeline and increasing the total carrying cost.
3.  **Commodity Price Dependency with No Hedge:** NovaGold is a "pure play" on the Donlin Gold Project, meaning its valuation is entirely exposed to the price of gold, which must not just remain high but must **continue to rise** to justify the escalating construction cost. A material correction in the gold price would immediately render the massive project uneconomic, severely de-valuing the stock.
4.  **"Paper Gold" Value Trap:** The stock's value is based on the large, high-grade reserve which will remain "paper gold" for the foreseeable future. Investors holding the stock are essentially financing a high-burn, development-stage company for at least another half-decade before a shovel can break ground on a multi-billion dollar construction, making the time value of money and the opportunity cost extremely high.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis and the results from the initial investigations, here are the most important remaining questions and next steps to investigate, focusing on quantifying the risks identified in the Bear Case.

### **Key Unanswered Questions and Next Steps**

#### **1. Quantifying Permitting Delay and Legal Risk**

*   **Determine the SEIS Timeline:** The court has mandated a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to study a catastrophic tailings spill, which has halted construction activities related to the challenged federal permits. **Investigate the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) typical timelines for an SEIS process on a project of this scale.** This will help estimate how many months or years the project timeline will be *pushed back* from the currently stated "early next decade" production target.
*   **Track Alaska Supreme Court Rulings:** Your analysis noted the Alaska Supreme Court is expected to rule on challenges to the project's water rights and pipeline Right-of-Way in 2025. **Actively monitor for these specific court decisions.** A ruling against Donlin could introduce a new phase of environmental/design work and potentially require the company to spend millions more on permit defense and redesign.

#### **2. Modeling the Impact of Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Inflation**

*   **Create an Updated NPV Model (Sensitivity Analysis):** The 2021 Technical Report provided an After-Tax Net Present Value (NPV) of **\$3.0 Billion** at a \$1,500/oz gold price and 5% discount rate, with initial CapEx at **\$7.4 billion**.
    *   **Find or build a sensitivity analysis for a higher CapEx:** Model the NPV impact assuming a \$8.0 billion, \$8.5 billion, and \$9.0 billion CapEx (as acknowledged by the CEO).
    *   **Determine the "Threshold Gold Price":** Calculate the gold price required to achieve an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of, for example, 15% or 20% at the escalated CapEx figure. This will show the true **leverage vs. risk** trade-off.
*   **Search for Analyst/Management CapEx Range:** While the CEO admitted CapEx will likely rise, **search for the latest analyst reports or management's most recent guidance on a potential *range* for the new CapEx.** This will help you anchor your new NPV model.

#### **3. Assessing Partner Financing and Long-Term Operational Commitment**

*   **Examine Paulson's Construction Financing Track Record:** John Paulson is a legendary gold investor, but funding a multi-billion dollar construction is different from buying an equity stake. **Search for evidence of Paulson Advisers or John Paulson personally funding or taking a major construction financing role (debt or equity) in a greenfield mine project with a CapEx of over $2 billion.** Your initial search hinted at a role in the smaller **Perpetua Resources** project, which could be a proxy for their intent, but Donlin is 5-6x the size.
*   **Investigate Long-Term Capital Raising Strategy:** Beyond the $136 million cash on hand, NovaGold and Paulson need *billions* more. **Search for explicit commentary from NovaGold or Paulson management on their intended *method* for raising the project's construction capital (e.g., debt financing from a consortium of banks, streaming/royalty deals, or further equity raises).** This will directly address the "Severe Financing and Dilution Risk" in the bear case.

#### **4. Evaluating Native Corporation Support Nuance**

*   **Differentiate Native Corporation Stances:** Your analysis notes NovaGold collaborates with the two landholders (Calista Corporation and The Kuskokwim Corporation - TKC) but faces opposition from multiple other Tribes (e.g., Mother Kuskokwim Tribal Coalition). **Clarify the precise position of TKC, the surface rights owner.** Are the two land-owning corporations unified in their current support, or is there any internal dissent within the land-owning Native Corporations that could affect the Surface Use Agreement (SUA)? This is a critical social license risk.
