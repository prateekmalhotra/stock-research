## Business Summary

Instacart operates a technology platform that connects customers with freelance personal shoppers who pick up groceries and other goods from local retail stores and deliver them directly to the customer's home. It acts as the digital middleman between the consumer and the physical store. The company's customer base consists primarily of households across the United States and Canada who value the convenience of delivery. Instacart earns revenue in three main ways: by charging customers various delivery and service fees, selling subscription memberships (Instacart+), and most importantly, selling advertising space to large food and consumer goods companies to promote their products directly within the Instacart app. This advertising revenue stream is crucial to the overall business model.

## Business Model Risk

Instacart faces major near-term risks from intense competition. Many large grocery retailers have been building their own in-house delivery systems, potentially cutting Instacart out as the middleman. If these competitors offer cheaper or faster service, Instacart will lose market share and may be forced to lower fees or increase spending, which directly harms profits. A significant long-term threat involves the company's reliance on independent, freelance shoppers (the 'gig economy' model). Instacart saves massive amounts of money by treating these workers as contractors rather than employees, but if courts or new government regulations require the company to classify them as full employees, its operating costs would dramatically increase. This labor risk has historically plagued the entire gig economy sector, and the possibility of adverse legislative changes remains a major cause for concern. Additionally, since delivery fees are often seen as a luxury, any economic downturn or high inflation could lead customers to save money by shopping for themselves, directly impacting order volumes and earnings.

## Company History

Maplebear Inc. is the corporate legal name for the popular technology company **Instacart**. It operates as the largest online grocery delivery and pickup platform in North America.

Here is a detailed history lesson on Maplebear Inc. (Instacart), from its beginnings to the present day.

### The Inception and Founding Goal (2012–2014)

1.  **A Problem to Solve:** Maplebear Inc. was founded as Instacart in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen, and Brandon Leonardo in San Francisco. Mehta was inspired by the personal inconvenience of needing groceries but not having a car, recalling the struggle of taking a bus in the cold for groceries while growing up in Canada.
2.  **The Core Mission:** The central goal was to make grocery shopping "effortless" and bridge the growing gap between consumers who wanted convenience and local grocery stores that lacked a seamless online delivery solution.
3.  **The Original Model:** The company created a simple online platform where customers could order from their favorite local grocery stores. Instacart did not own the inventory, stores, or delivery trucks; instead, it used a network of independent contract workers, called "personal shoppers," to pick up and deliver the orders.
4.  **The Name:** The company’s legal name, Maplebear Inc., is a symbolic nod to its founder’s background and location: "Maple" represents Canada, and "Bear" refers to the bear on the California state flag.

### Problems and Headwinds on the Journey

1.  **Early Competition and Partner Risk:** A major challenge was the risk that a grocery partner could become a competitor. This threat became real when Amazon acquired Whole Foods, a major Instacart partner, and quickly pulled its stores from the Instacart platform to build its own delivery service.
2.  **The Labor and Shopper Controversy (Headwind):** Throughout the late 2010s, Instacart faced significant backlash from its network of personal shoppers over pay practices. A key controversy involved a new payment model where shoppers alleged Instacart used customer tips to cover their guaranteed minimum payment, essentially using tips to subsidize the company's costs rather than giving them to the shoppers as an extra bonus.
3.  **The Pandemic Chaos (Headwind and Operational Challenge):** Despite a massive demand increase, the early COVID-19 pandemic period was chaotic. Instacart was initially unprepared to handle the staggering surge in orders, leading to long customer wait times and inventory issues (like items being out of stock). They also faced public worker strikes over the lack of safety gear and requests for hazard pay during the peak of the crisis.
4.  **The Profitability and Valuation Drop:** For years, the company faced a history of losses, typical of high-growth tech firms. While it eventually achieved a period of profitability before its 2023 Initial Public Offering (IPO), its private valuation had dropped from a peak of \$39 billion during the pandemic to under \$10 billion at the time of the IPO, signaling investor concern about slowing growth and long-term earnings potential.

### Innovative Solutions and Tailwinds that Fueled Growth

1.  **The COVID-19 Tailwinds:** The single largest boost to the business was the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced millions of people to use grocery delivery for the first time. This gave Instacart what its CEO described as "five years of growth packed into one year," establishing its brand as an essential service.
2.  **Labor Solutions and Adaptations:** To manage the labor crisis, Instacart reversed its controversial tip policy, retroactively compensating shoppers for past underpayments. They also rapidly onboarded hundreds of thousands of new shoppers during the pandemic to meet demand and implemented operational solutions like allowing customers to select a general item (e.g., "any toilet paper") when specific brands were sold out.
3.  **The Major Strategic Pivot (Instacart Platform):** To counter competition and partnership risk, Instacart shifted its business from being just a delivery app to a "grocery technology company" by launching the **Instacart Platform** in 2022. This platform provides the very tools and technology that grocery retailers need to run their own independent online and in-store operations.
4.  **New Revenue Streams (Carrot Ads):** As a critical part of this platform, Instacart developed its **Carrot Ads** business. The company leverages the valuable data it gathers on customer purchases to sell targeted advertising space to large Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) brands, turning a significant portion of its revenue away from low-margin delivery fees toward high-margin advertising income.
5.  **Digitizing the Physical Store:** The platform extends beyond online orders by offering products like **Caper Carts**, which are AI-powered smart shopping carts that allow customers to scan, track spending, and check out right from the cart inside the physical store. This helped retailers, especially independent ones, keep up with major competitors like Amazon.

### Maplebear Inc. Today (Present Date)

1.  **Public Company Status:** Maplebear Inc., doing business as Instacart, completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in September 2023 and trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker CART.
2.  **Current Goal:** The company's goal has evolved from simple convenience to being the foundational technology provider for the entire North American grocery industry, helping retailers digitize their businesses both online (through white-label e-commerce storefronts) and in-store (through smart hardware).
3.  **Diversified Business:** Today, Instacart's success relies heavily on this two-sided business model: its traditional **Consumer Marketplace** (the delivery app you know) and its high-growth **Instacart Platform** and advertising business, which together make the company a deep-rooted partner to, rather than just a platform for, grocers.

## Moat Analysis

Maplebear Inc. (CART), which operates as Instacart, has built a significant market position not by fundamentally changing the low-margin grocery business, but by becoming the essential technology and logistics partner for retailers. Its moat is rooted in its extensive network and its strategic shift from a pure delivery service to a retail technology and advertising platform.

### **The Core Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Dominant Retailer Network:** Instacart's primary advantage is its massive network of over 1,800 retail partners, covering roughly 85% of U.S. grocers, which is difficult for a competitor to replicate quickly. This scale is what makes it unique from competitors; rivals like DoorDash or Uber Eats started with restaurant delivery, while Amazon's grocery offering is more focused on its own or owned stores.

2.  **Powerful Network Effect:** The platform benefits from a two-sided network effect.
    *   **For Customers:** The more grocery stores and retailers that partner with Instacart, the more appealing and useful the app is to customers, offering greater choice and coverage.
    *   **For Retailers:** As more customers use the platform, it becomes a crucial source of sales and a necessary online presence for grocers who lack their own robust e-commerce system.

3.  **The High-Value Customer Base:** Instacart appeals to a specific, high-value customer who prioritizes time and convenience over cost, which is a key part of its growth story. These customers are less price-sensitive and spend more on groceries than the average shopper, enabling the company to maintain high gross margins despite competitive pressures.

### **Pricing Power and Special Market Position**

4.  **Pricing Power from Convenience:** Instacart can charge its users a premium—including delivery fees, service fees, and sometimes product markups—because its customers are willing to pay for the massive time savings and convenience. This ability to maintain higher prices for a specific demographic is a form of pricing power, despite facing competition from lower-cost options like Walmart or in-store shopping.

5.  **Dominance in Third-Party Delivery:** The company holds a significant majority of the market share in the *third-party* grocery delivery sector, giving it a powerful position when negotiating with consumer product brands and retailers.

6.  **High-Margin Ad Platform:** The company has created a special position by transitioning its business to become a profitable **Retail Media Network** (advertising business), which is now a major differentiator. Since customers have high purchase intent when they open the app, brands pay Instacart to put their products and ads in front of shoppers, providing a high-margin, less-volatile revenue stream.

### **Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk**

7.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts:** The vast majority of its business is recurring, not one-time.
    *   **Customer Stickiness:** Instacart users, particularly those with an annual Instacart+ membership, show strong loyalty and retention rates, partially driven by the psychological principle of "sunk costs" once they've paid the annual fee.
    *   **Retailer Stickiness:** Contracts with major retailers are becoming stickier as Instacart integrates a wider suite of technology services (like its in-store tech) beyond just delivery, making it harder for the retailer to switch providers.

8.  **Displacement Risk from Capital:** The business is vulnerable to competitors with massive capital, such as Amazon and DoorDash, who can aggressively bundle services or offer lower prices to steal market share. Grocers themselves also pose a risk, as they might use Instacart to learn the process and then invest in their own in-house delivery capabilities.

9.  **Investing in Innovation and R&D:** Instacart is actively investing in innovation to create a defensible moat that goes beyond just the delivery service. They must constantly innovate to maintain their edge by offering a more complete solution to grocers.

### **Past and Present Moat-Building Strategy**

10. **The "Connected Stores" Strategy:** Instacart's recent strategy to ensure a solid moat is to move *inside* the grocery store. Products like AI-powered **Caper Carts** (smart shopping carts) and **Carrot Tags** (digital shelf labels) integrate Instacart’s technology into the physical store experience, making it an indispensable operating system for retailers. This makes it a tech partner for both online and in-store shopping, not just a delivery app.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on a review of recent earnings calls (Q4 2024, Q1 2025, Q2 2025) and investor updates, here are the key catalysts that could increase Maplebear Inc. (CART) stock price.

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Strong Profitability and Share Buybacks:** The company has been consistently beating expectations on adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income, showing solid operating performance and financial discipline. Management has also been executing a significant share buyback program, which can directly support the stock price by reducing the number of outstanding shares.
2.  **Growth in Advertising and Data Revenue:** The revenue from advertising and data is growing faster than the core Gross Transaction Value (GTV) and has reached an annual run rate of over \$1 billion. This is a higher-margin business, and its continued acceleration is a key catalyst for improving overall company profitability.
3.  **Increased User Engagement and Retention:** Management highlights that initiatives like lower basket minimums for Instacart+ members and new features are successfully driving stronger user growth, higher order frequency, and better customer retention, especially among new users.
4.  **Successful CEO Transition and Strategic Continuity:** The recent CEO transition is seen as a smooth shift with the new leader emphasizing *continuity* in the strategy of profitable growth and deepening retailer relationships. A new CEO successfully executing an established, profitable plan can be a positive signal to the market.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)

1.  **Expansion of the Enterprise Technology Platform:** This is a major long-term focus, where Instacart acts as a technology partner for grocers, selling tools like "Caper Carts" (smart shopping carts) and "Storefront Pro" (e-commerce solutions). Management views this expansion, especially internationally after the Wynshop acquisition, as key to securing recurring, higher-margin revenue streams and deepening retailer "stickiness."
2.  **Focus on Affordability and Price Parity:** Management is prioritizing efforts to make Instacart more affordable for customers through loyalty program integrations, acceptance of government benefits like SNAP, and incentivizing retailers to offer price parity (same prices as in-store). This strategy aims to accelerate the broader long-term adoption of online grocery shopping.
3.  **Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Efficiency and Innovation:** Management repeatedly points to AI as a core driving force, being used to improve order fulfillment speed, accuracy, and customer experience. The long-term catalyst is the potential for AI to drive significant, sustainable efficiency gains across the business, lowering costs and boosting margins.
4.  **Accelerating Market Share in a Large Industry:** Instacart holds a leading position in the massive \$1.2 trillion U.S. grocery market. The long-term catalyst is the continued, slow-but-steady shift of grocery shopping from physical stores to online, with Instacart positioned to capture the majority of this growth by extending its category leadership.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Maplebear Inc. (CART)'s available proxy statement (DEF 14A) information on management incentives and compensation, here is the conclusion regarding their alignment with shareholder interests.

---

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Maplebear Inc. (CART)

#### **Compensation Structure & Alignment (Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest)**

1.  **Heavy Reliance on Equity-Based Pay:** Maplebear Inc. (Instacart) grants the majority of its Named Executive Officers' (NEOs) total direct compensation in the form of equity awards, primarily Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and for the CEO, Performance Stock Units (PSUs). This structure effectively makes executive pay "at-risk" and aligns a significant portion of their potential earnings with the long-term success of the company's stock price.
2.  **Performance-Tied Equity:** A key incentive for the CEO is tied directly to superior stock price performance. The CEO's 2022 Performance Stock Unit (PSU) award was modified to have explicit, aggressive stock price goals ranging from **$43.32 per share to $86.64 per share**. Achieving these high thresholds is a direct win for shareholders and demonstrates a strong pay-for-performance model at the top.
3.  **Low Cash Incentive:** The company typically **does not maintain a formal annual cash bonus plan** for its NEOs, meaning short-term cash incentives are minimal or non-existent. This choice de-emphasizes short-term, easily manipulated operational goals in favor of sustained, long-term performance reflected in the stock.
4.  **Governance & Risk Mitigation:** The company implements **Stock Ownership Guidelines** and a **Clawback Policy**, which are corporate governance features designed to require executives to maintain a material stake and allow the board to recover incentive pay in cases of misconduct or financial restatement.

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors (Higher the Better)**

1.  **Limited Individual CEO Ownership:** The direct ownership of the former CEO (Fidji Simo) was reported to be **0.16%** of the company's shares, valued at approximately $16.36 million. While the dollar value is substantial, the percentage is relatively low for a CEO of an early-stage public company, suggesting a lower personal capital stake than what is generally considered "higher the better."
2.  **No Clear Aggregate Control:** While the aggregate beneficial ownership percentage for all directors and executive officers as a group is not explicitly available, the low individual CEO ownership suggests the *management team* as a whole may not hold a controlling stake, which is often a sign of high commitment. However, the influence of pre-IPO venture capital funds and other early investors with large stakes is often a bigger factor for newly public companies.

#### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

Maplebear Inc.'s management is largely **incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**, particularly concerning long-term value creation.

The compensation structure, with its **heavy weight on performance-contingent equity (PSUs tied to stock price)** and the **absence of a formal cash bonus plan**, directs management's focus toward the sustained appreciation of the stock price, which is the primary interest of shareholders. The low percentage of individual CEO ownership is a point of caution, but the rigorous performance targets for the equity grants act as a powerful counter-incentive against simply lining their own pockets through time-vested awards or easily achieved metrics.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of the price history and technical indicators for Maplebear Inc. (CART), here are the key points:

1.  **Current Price and Range Overview:** The stock's 52-week trading range is a high of \$53.50 and a low of \$34.87. A recent closing price was around \$39.68 (as of October 25, 2025).

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Maplebear Inc. (CART) is currently trading approximately **13.80%** above its 52-week low of \$34.87.

3.  **Technical Analysis Assessment:** Based on technical indicators from major platforms, the stock is showing mixed signals, but with a leaning toward short-term bearishness.
    *   One analysis suggests a current overall **"sell"** technical rating, with Moving Averages indicating a "strong sell" signal.
    *   Conversely, other daily technical analyses are in a **"Neutral"** position, with moving averages specifically showing a "Buy" outlook.
    *   The price is closer to the bottom of its 52-week range, indicating it is trading low relative to its recent yearly performance, but the technical trend may suggest further downward pressure or consolidation.

4.  **Big Drops/Rises Explanation:** The stock's all-time high of \$53.50 was set in the first few months of 2025, from which it has dropped significantly to its current level near the low end of the range. This multi-month decline indicates that any initial post-IPO enthusiasm (IPO was in September 2023) may have waned.

5.  **Recent Earnings and Analyst Activity:** The company recently reported an earnings beat, with a quarterly EPS of \$0.41, surpassing the consensus estimate of \$0.39, and a revenue beat as well. Despite the positive earnings news, several analysts recently reduced their price targets for the stock in October 2025, which can contribute to downward pressure and cautious investor sentiment.

## Long Thesis

Maplebear Inc. (Instacart) is no longer just a delivery service; it is transitioning into an essential and highly profitable technology partner for the entire grocery industry. The bull case rests on the idea that the company has secured its profit engine (near term) and is building an impenetrable competitive shield (long term). In the near term, strong company profits are primarily driven by its fast-growing, high-margin advertising business (selling ad space to brands inside the app), which generates much more revenue per order than low-margin delivery fees. This financial strength allows Instacart to manage costs and return cash to shareholders. Long term, Instacart is becoming indispensable by providing the digital infrastructure for grocers, both online and inside the physical store (through smart shopping carts and e-commerce tools). By integrating its technology deeply across 85% of U.S. grocery stores, Instacart ensures it captures the majority of the massive grocery market as it slowly shifts from physical to digital shopping, making it extremely difficult for competitors or the grocers themselves to cut Instacart out.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions for this bull case to succeed are: 1) The high-profit advertising business must continue to grow significantly faster than the lower-margin delivery business. 2) Grocery retailers, particularly smaller ones, will continue to rely on Instacart's technology platform instead of successfully building their own comparable, affordable, in-house delivery and e-commerce solutions. 3) The high-value customer base (Instacart+ members) remains loyal and continues to prioritize convenience over small price differences, ensuring order volume remains high. 4) Instacart successfully maintains its current business model reliance on independent contract workers (the 'gig economy' model), avoiding massive cost increases from mandatory reclassification as full employees.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

## Critique and Bear Case Thesis for Maplebear Inc. (CART)

The long thesis for Instacart is vulnerable to flaws related to competitive pressure, the maturation of its core business lines, and regulatory risk to its operating model.

### Flaws and Holes in the Bull Case Thesis

#### **1. Misaligned Near-Term Profit Engine Growth**
*   **Bull Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The core assumption that the high-profit advertising business "must continue to grow significantly faster than the lower-margin delivery business" is not consistently supported by recent financial data.
*   **Corroborating Fact/Critique:** In Q3 2024, Instacart's advertising and other revenue grew 11% year-over-year, which was **in line with** its Transaction revenue (delivery/fees) growth of 12% year-over-year. The lack of significant outperformance in the high-margin segment undermines the claim of a fast-accelerating profit engine being the primary near-term driver of strength.

#### **2. Understated Retailer Self-Cannibalization and "Competitive Shield" Weakness**
*   **Bull Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The belief that grocers will "continue to rely" on Instacart and that its deep integration creates an "impenetrable competitive shield" overlooks the critical shift among major retailers.
*   **Corroborating Fact/Critique:** Major competitors like Walmart ($Walmart, with Spark Delivery), Target (Shipt), Kroger (Ocado partnership), and Amazon (Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods) are significantly investing in, or already own, comprehensive in-house delivery and e-commerce platforms. This is driven by grocers' desire to own the customer relationship, control valuable purchasing data, and eliminate the price difference/fees associated with third-party platforms like Instacart. This pursuit of in-house solutions directly erodes Instacart's long-term dominance as an indispensable partner, especially with larger chains.

#### **3. Increasing Competition and Customer Acquisition Costs**
*   **Bull Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The idea of capturing the "majority of the massive grocery market" is challenged by a highly fragmented and aggressive competitive landscape.
*   **Corroborating Fact/Critique:** The market is now crowded with deep-pocketed general delivery players like DoorDash and Uber Eats, both of which have rapidly expanded into the grocery space via partnerships. This intense competition is driving up customer acquisition costs (CAC) for Instacart, as evidenced by rising CAC and a reported quarter-over-quarter retention rate of 61%, suggesting high customer churn. High churn and rising CAC negate the profitability benefit of a loyal "high-value customer base."

#### **4. Significant Regulatory Threat to the Gig Economy Cost Model**
*   **Bull Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The assumption that Instacart will "successfully maintain its current business model reliance on independent contract workers" and avoid "massive cost increases" faces substantial legal and legislative headwinds.
*   **Corroborating Fact/Critique:** Local and state governments, such as Seattle, have successfully enacted "Pay Up" laws mandating minimum wage and benefits for gig workers, which has already led to Instacart adjusting operations and facing worker/customer frustration due to rerouting. Furthermore, Instacart has paid large settlements in California (e.g., $46.5 million) over past worker misclassification lawsuits, demonstrating the tangible cost of this legal risk. A forced nationwide reclassification of shoppers as employees could increase labor costs by an estimated 20% to 30%, which would severely compress Instacart's already thin transaction margins and impact overall profitability.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for Maplebear Inc. (CART)

Maplebear (Instacart) is a highly-valued delivery middleman whose long-term revenue and margin growth are at risk due to an intensified competitive environment and a highly precarious cost structure. The company’s moat, presented as an indispensable "technology partner," is being rapidly eroded as its largest and most profitable retailer partners aggressively pursue in-house e-commerce, delivery, and automated fulfillment to control their customer relationships, data, and margins. This erosion, coupled with increasing regulatory pressure on its core low-cost gig economy labor model—which could mandate a shift to a significantly more expensive employee model—creates a high risk of sustained margin compression and decelerating revenue growth. The high-margin advertising business, while strong, is not growing fast enough to offset the potential loss of Gross Transaction Volume (GTV) or the potential spike in labor costs, suggesting Instacart is a transitional player whose value will be captured by either its retailer partners or aggressive third-party competitors like DoorDash and Uber Eats.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the core of the bull-bear debate hinges on whether Instacart's high-margin advertising/tech business can outgrow the risks posed by competition and regulation.

The initial search results provided recent (Q2 2025) financial metrics and context for the analyst price target cuts, which helps address some of the Bear Case concerns.

Here are the important questions left unanswered and the next steps for further investigation:

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

#### **1. Quantify the Instacart Platform (Moat Defense)**
*   The Bear Case argues that large retailers are building their own systems. The Long Thesis relies on the **Instacart Platform** being sticky.
*   **Investigate:** Are the retail banners adopting the Instacart Platform (Storefront Pro, Caper Carts, FoodStorm) primarily smaller, independent grocers, or are major chains signing up for a full suite of services?
    *   *Need to find* evidence of large, named, and influential retailers that have adopted the full "Instacart Platform" suite (beyond just the delivery partnership).
    *   **Search Query Example:** `Instacart Platform major retailer clients full suite`

#### **2. Re-test the Advertising Growth Thesis (Profit Engine)**
*   Q2 2025 results show advertising (12% YoY) is **modestly outpacing** GTV (11% YoY), but the difference is small. The Bear Case mentioned Q3 2024 was "in line."
*   **Investigate:** What is the **long-term growth trajectory** and management's long-term target for the advertising take-rate (Ad revenue as a % of GTV), which currently sits at a relatively flat 2.8%? High-growth companies are expected to show greater acceleration in their highest-margin segment.
    *   *Need to find* explicit long-term targets or commentary on the *expected rate of acceleration* for this ratio.
    *   **Search Query Example:** `Instacart long term advertising take-rate target` or `Instacart ad revenue as a percentage of GTV growth forecast`

#### **3. Pinpoint the Reasons for Price Target Cuts (Market Sentiment)**
*   The stock price is near its 52-week low, and analysts like Stifel and Jefferies recently cut targets despite the Q2 2025 earnings beat.
*   **Investigate:** What are the *specific core drivers* of this investor pessimism? Analyst reports often point to:
    *   **A.** Increasing competition/declining market share (especially against DoorDash/Uber in small baskets).
    *   **B.** Near-term pressure on incremental margins (due to spending on affordability/Instacart+).
    *   **C.** Concerns over high Stock-Based Compensation (SBC), which offsets GAAP net income.
    *   **Search Query Example:** `reasons for Jefferies Stifel Instacart price target cut` (Need to look for the full analyst reports' arguments)

#### **4. Quantify the Labor/Gig Economy Risk**
*   The Bear Case estimates a potential 20-30% labor cost hike from reclassification. This is a massive, existential risk.
*   **Investigate:** What is Instacart's reported **shopper pay and incentives cost** as a percentage of its total revenue or GTV? This figure provides the "base" number for the potential 20-30% cost increase, allowing you to quantify the full financial impact on margins.
    *   **Search Query Example:** `Instacart shopper pay and incentives as percentage of revenue`

#### **5. Assess Competitive Risk in "Small Basket" Orders**
*   Instacart is addressing competition from DoorDash/Uber with a lower Instacart+ basket minimum.
*   **Investigate:** Is Instacart's market share *actually holding* in the convenience/small-basket category against competitors like DoorDash (which is heavily focused on this market)? High customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer churn/retention of 61% are still concerns.
    *   *Need to find* recent (2025) market share data for third-party grocery delivery broken down by **basket size** or specific competitor comparison (e.g., DoorDash vs. Instacart grocery share).
    *   **Search Query Example:** `DoorDash vs Instacart grocery market share small basket 2025`
