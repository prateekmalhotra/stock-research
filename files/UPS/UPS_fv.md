### 2. Revenue Projection: The UPS Business Engine

UPS's revenue engine is fundamentally driven by two core components: **Average Daily Volume (ADV) Growth** and **Revenue Per Piece (RPP) / Pricing Quality**. The projections are built on a conservative outlook, integrating management's latest guidance on cost reduction and volume recovery.

**Management Commentary & Business Engine Assumptions:**

*   **2024 Base Revenue:** The starting point for projections is the company's fiscal 2024 full-year revenue guidance of approximately **$\$91.1$ billion**.
*   **Volume (ADV):** The U.S. Domestic segment showed a return to positive volume growth in Q2 and Q3 2024, the first in several quarters. This trend is expected to continue as the economic environment normalizes and the company focuses on *revenue quality*.
*   **Pricing (RPP):** UPS is successfully implementing **revenue quality** initiatives and strong base pricing to increase RPP, especially in its premium segments, while managing a mix shift toward lightweight, short-zone parcels (e.g., SurePost).
*   **International:** The segment showed revenue and profit growth in Q3 2024, driven by export strength, despite a weak macro environment in Europe and Asia. Nearshoring in the Americas is a new growth area.

**Revenue Growth Assumptions (2025-2030):**

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $5.0\%$ | A conservative initial step-up reflecting a full year of domestic volume recovery, continued strong base pricing/RPP growth, and the lapping of the prior year's labor contract challenges. This is below the long-term e-commerce growth trend, acknowledging continued economic headwinds. |
| **2026** | $4.5\%$ | Volume growth moderates slightly but remains healthy, with ongoing gains from strategic revenue quality initiatives (RPP). |
| **2027** | $4.0\%$ | Slowing down slightly, representing a conservative long-term growth rate below its primary competitor's target, factoring in the company's "Better, not Bigger" strategy focusing on profitable volume. |
| **2028** | $3.5\%$ | Continued moderation towards the long-term GDP and general logistics market growth rate, remaining conservative. |
| **2029** | $3.0\%$ | Approaching maturity rate. |
| **2030** | $2.5\%$ | Final projection year, approaching terminal growth. |

**Projected Revenue (USD Millions):**

| Year | 2024 (E) | 2025 (P) | 2026 (P) | 2027 (P) | 2028 (P) | 2029 (P) | 2030 (P) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $91,100$ | $95,655$ | $99,969$ | $103,968$ | $107,607$ | $110,835$ | $113,506$ |

### 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection

**Net Income Margin Assumptions:**

*   **2024 Base Margin (E):** Management is guiding for a Consolidated Operating Margin of $\sim10.0\%$ (the low end of their guidance) and a U.S. Domestic Operating Margin of $10\%$ by the end of 2024. Historically, UPS's net income margin is typically $70\%-80\%$ of its operating margin due to non-operating income (like pension income) and a competitive tax rate. Taking a conservative approach, a **Net Income Margin of $\mathbf{7.5\%}$** is estimated for 2024.
*   **Margin Expansion (2025-2030):** Management has stated a commitment to driving **$\$1$ billion in cost savings** by the end of 2024 and leveraging ongoing productivity initiatives. The labor contract headwind is expected to abate after 2024. As revenue grows and operational efficiency gains are realized, the net income margin is conservatively projected to expand by a modest **$\mathbf{20}$ basis points** (0.20\%) per year, reflecting the company's premium provider strategy and cost discipline.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**

*   **ROIC (Conservative):** The rule mandates using a reasonable ROIC based on the past to calculate additional income. The historical ROIC for a company like UPS has fluctuated but has often been in the mid-to-high teens. To be **conservative** and reflect the post-contract, higher-cost operating environment, a flat **ROIC of $\mathbf{5.0\%}$** is used.

**Net Income Calculation ($NI_{t} = (Revenue_{t} \times NI\text{ }Margin_{t}) + (NI_{t-1} \times ROIC)$):**

| Metric (USD Millions) | 2024 (E) | 2025 (P) | 2026 (P) | 2027 (P) | 2028 (P) | 2029 (P) | 2030 (P) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Revenue** | $91,100$ | $95,655$ | $99,969$ | $103,968$ | $107,607$ | $110,835$ | $113,506$ |
| **B. Net Income Margin** | $7.50\%$ | $7.70\%$ | $7.90\%$ | $8.10\%$ | $8.30\%$ | $8.50\%$ | $8.70\%$ |
| **C. Operating NI (A x B)** | $6,833$ | $7,365$ | $7,898$ | $8,421$ | $8,931$ | $9,421$ | $9,875$ |
| **D. ROIC on Prior NI (NI $\mathbf{_{t-1}}$ $\mathbf{\times}$ 5.0%)** | N/A | $342$ | $385$ | $427$ | $470$ | $510$ | $547$ |
| **E. Total Net Income (C + D)** | $6,833$ | $\mathbf{7,707}$ | $\mathbf{8,283}$ | $\mathbf{8,848}$ | $\mathbf{9,401}$ | $\mathbf{9,931}$ | $\mathbf{10,422}$ |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** A **$\mathbf{9.0\%}$** discount rate is chosen, reflecting a WACC for a large, established, mature company with moderate debt and a higher-than-average beta due to cyclicality. This is a conservative WACC compared to many analyst estimates.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth):** A very conservative terminal growth rate (**$\mathbf{2.0\%}$**) is used, reflecting growth just slightly above long-term inflation, for a mature market leader.

**DCF Calculation (Net Income = Free Cash Flow for DCF Purpose):**

| Year | Total Net Income (D) (Millions) | Discount Factor ($\mathbf{9.0\%}$) | NPV of Cash Flow (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $7,707$ | $0.917$ | $7,065$ |
| **2026** | $8,283$ | $0.842$ | $6,975$ |
| **2027** | $8,848$ | $0.772$ | $6,839$ |
| **2028** | $9,401$ | $0.708$ | $6,659$ |
| **2029** | $9,931$ | $0.650$ | $6,455$ |
| **2030** | $10,422$ | $0.596$ | $6,215$ |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | $\mathbf{40,208}$ |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{Cash Flow_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\$10,422 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02}$$
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\$10,630}{0.07} \approx \$151,857 \text{ million}$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value:**
$$NPV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$
$$NPV(TV) = \$151,857 \times 0.596 \approx \mathbf{\$90,517} \text{ million}$$

**Total Enterprise Value (EV) / Equity Value (Millions):**
$$EV = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$$
$$EV = \$40,208 + \$90,517 = \mathbf{\$130,725} \text{ million}$$

***

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total Enterprise Value} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$
$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$130,725 + \$6,500 - \$21,500 = \mathbf{\$115,725} \text{ million}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Total Shares Outstanding}}$$
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$115,725,000,000}{853,369,558} \approx \mathbf{\$135.61}$$

***

## Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$135.61** |
| **Current Market Price (Nov 4, 2025)** | **\$93.25** |
| **Difference** | **$+45.4\%$** |

**Justification for Discrepancy (Why the Market is Different):**

The calculated Fair Value of $\mathbf{\$135.61}$ is $\mathbf{45.4\%}$ higher than the current market price of $\$93.25$. This significant gap suggests the market is making much more **bearish** assumptions about the future performance and risk profile of UPS than those used in this conservative DCF model.

The key assumptions where the market likely differs are:

1.  **Revenue Growth Rate:** The model assumes a volume recovery coupled with successful RPP/quality initiatives, leading to an average revenue growth of $\sim3.7\%$ (from 2025 to 2030). The market is likely pricing in a near-stagnant or even declining core volume environment due to the ongoing shift of lower-margin packages (e.g., from USPS integration), the loss of Amazon business, and a prolonged weak global economic environment. The market may assume $\sim1.0\%-2.0\%$ growth, closer to the final maturity rate, for a longer period.
2.  **Margin Expansion & Cost Headwinds:** The model conservatively assumes net income margin expansion from $7.7\%$ to $8.7\%$ over the forecast period, driven by cost-saving programs ("Fit to Serve," etc.) and operational leverage promised by management. The market is likely far more skeptical about the company's ability to offset the **long-term, elevated labor costs** from the new Teamster's contract with productivity gains. The current price may reflect a belief that the net income margin will remain relatively flat or be permanently impaired (e.g., stuck around the $7.0\%-7.5\%$ range).
3.  **Risk and Discount Rate:** The model uses a **$\mathbf{9.0\%}$** discount rate. The high uncertainty and volatility experienced by the stock, particularly around the labor contract negotiations, volume issues, and the CEO transition/strategic shift (divestiture of Coyote, etc.) means the market is likely applying a much **higher implied discount rate** to account for this execution risk. A discount rate of $11\%$ to $12\%$ would be needed to bring the Fair Value closer to the market price.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value analysis suggests that **UPS is undervalued** based on the conservative business engine model derived from management's stated goals and historical performance. The market is discounting the company heavily, likely due to a pessimistic view on its ability to overcome the post-contract labor cost structure and successfully execute its volume recovery and cost-saving initiatives over the long term. If UPS demonstrates consistent execution in 2025 and beyond by hitting its $10\%$ U.S. domestic operating margin target and delivering on the cost-saving guidance, the stock should move toward the calculated intrinsic value.
