## Business Summary

United Parcel Service (UPS) is a global delivery and logistics company that operates the crucial network connecting sellers and buyers around the world. Its core business model involves picking up packages and freight (large cargo), transporting them using a vast fleet of planes and trucks, sorting them in massive centralized hubs, and delivering them quickly to the final destination. UPS’s customer base is geographically diverse but concentrated in the U.S. and Europe. It serves large businesses, such as manufacturers, retailers, and major online sellers (B2B), as well as millions of residential customers who buy goods online (B2C). The company generates the majority of its revenue from two main areas: domestic and international package delivery, which relies on high volume and efficient routing, and specialized supply chain solutions, which manages complex warehousing and logistics for large corporations. The business profits by maximizing the number of packages moved through its established, fixed transportation infrastructure.

## Business Model Risk

The business model faces significant near-term and long-term threats that can rapidly impact earnings. In the near term, the most critical risk is labor disruption; UPS relies heavily on unionized workers (the Teamsters), and a failure to reach a contract agreement can trigger a strike. A strike, such as the one that occurred in 1997, completely halts operations, causing billions in losses and permanently pushing customers to competitors like FedEx. This risk is always high when union contracts near expiration. Another immediate threat is sensitivity to costs; because UPS uses enormous amounts of jet fuel and diesel, its profit margins are quickly eroded when global fuel prices or general inflation (labor, parts) rise suddenly. Long-term risks center on competition and economic vulnerability. Fierce competition from rivals and, critically, from major customers (like Amazon) who are building their own sophisticated delivery networks reduces UPS’s volume and limits its ability to raise prices. Furthermore, since package volume directly correlates with consumer health and global manufacturing output, a widespread recession causes people to buy fewer goods, immediately hitting UPS’s revenue. Finally, global regulatory pressure to transition its enormous fleet to electric vehicles presents a long-term risk requiring massive, costly capital investment.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), tracing its path from a small messenger service to the global logistics leader it is today.

### **Part 1: Inception and Foundational Goal (1907 – 1950s)**

1.  **Founding a Reliable Messenger Service (1907):** The company was founded in Seattle, Washington, by 19-year-old James E. Casey and Claude Ryan, using a borrowed $\$100$ to start the "American Messenger Company."
2.  **The Original Business Goal:** Initially, their main service was delivering messages, running errands, and delivering retail packages for department stores. The core business philosophy, established by Casey, was simple: "Only promise what you can deliver, and make sure you deliver what you promise," setting the standard for absolute reliability.
3.  **The Shift to Package Delivery (1913):** As telephones and cars became common, they shifted their focus entirely to package delivery for retail stores, changing the name to Merchants Parcel Delivery.
4.  **The Birth of the Brand (1919):** They expanded to Oakland, California, and adopted the name **United Parcel Service (UPS)** to reflect that they were a "united" business of various mergers. The now-famous brown color was introduced for their trucks and uniforms because it looked professional and hid the dirt of the era better than other colors.

---

### **Part 2: Headwinds, Breakthroughs, and National Expansion (1950s – 1980s)**

5.  **Headwind: The Retail Problem (1950s):** A major challenge arose when customers started using their own cars to take purchases home from department stores, drastically cutting demand for UPS's core service.
6.  **Innovative Solution: The Common Carrier System:** UPS responded by transforming itself into a "common carrier," meaning they started delivering packages for *all* customers—businesses and private citizens—instead of just department stores. This put them in direct competition with the U.S. Postal Service.
7.  **Major Regulatory Headwind:** Achieving this common carrier status across the country was a decades-long struggle, requiring more than 100 applications to state and federal regulators.
8.  **The "Golden Link" Breakthrough (1975):** This long regulatory fight finally ended in 1975, when UPS was granted permission to serve every address in the 48 contiguous United States. This milestone, known as the "Golden Link," established the nationwide ground network that remains UPS's backbone today.
9.  **Tailwind: Air Deregulation:** A major boost came with the air cargo deregulation of the late 1970s, which freed package delivery companies from strict government control over air routes and pricing, opening the door for time-sensitive, overnight delivery.
10. **The Launch of UPS Airlines (1988):** To capitalize on this air opportunity, and the growing demand for fast shipping, UPS launched its own dedicated cargo airline. This gave the company full control over its entire global network, from ground to air.

---

### **Part 3: Innovation and Labor Challenges (1990s – 2000s)**

11. **The Automation and Logistics Revolution:** UPS built **Worldport** in Louisville, Kentucky, which serves as the massive, central hub for its global air network. This facility is one of the world's largest automated sorting centers, processing millions of packages a day on over 150 miles of conveyor belts, allowing for extremely fast overnight air service.
12. **The Introduction of Package Tracking (1994):** UPS pioneered the use of electronic tracking, which gave customers the ability to monitor their package’s journey in real-time, completely changing customer expectations for the delivery industry.
13. **Headwind: The 1997 Teamsters Strike:** A significant challenge was the 15-day nationwide strike by 185,000 union employees. The primary issues were the company's heavy reliance on lower-wage part-time workers and their attempt to withdraw from the union's pension plan.
14. **Labor Resolution and Impact:** The strike was widely seen as a victory for the union, costing UPS hundreds of millions of dollars. The company agreed to convert 10,000 part-time jobs into full-time positions and secured the workers' pension plan, reinforcing the power of its unionized workforce.
15. **The ORION Software Innovation:** To squeeze every bit of efficiency from its ground operations, UPS developed **ORION** (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation). This advanced software calculates the most efficient route for every driver's daily deliveries, saving millions of miles in driving and millions of gallons of fuel.

---

### **Part 4: The E-commerce Era and Modern Strategy (Present Day)**

16. **Major Tailwind: The E-commerce Boom:** The explosion of online shopping, which began in the late 1990s and accelerated massively in the 21st century, became UPS's single largest tailwind, continuously driving massive growth in package volume.
17. **Headwind: New Competition and Costs:** The rapid growth of e-commerce brought new challenges, notably intense competition from players like Amazon, who began building their own package delivery network (Amazon Logistics). This pushed UPS to manage the increasing cost of residential (home) delivery.
18. **Modern Strategic Pivot:** UPS's current strategy is to be "Better not Bigger" by prioritizing high-profit, specialized deliveries. This includes focusing on higher-margin customers like small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and expanding into complex, high-value logistics, such as healthcare and "cold chain" delivery for medicines.
19. **Goal Today:** UPS's core goal remains connecting the world through "intelligent logistics." It has evolved from a local messenger service to a global supply chain manager, using its massive physical network (trucks, planes, hubs) and cutting-edge technology (AI, drones) to move goods for over 220 countries and territories.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is one of the widest and most durable in the logistics industry, built primarily upon massive physical infrastructure, technological superiority, and strong customer integration.

### **Analysis of the UPS Moat**

1.  **Massive Physical Network (High Barrier to Entry):** UPS's moat is rooted in its extensive, worldwide ground and air delivery network, which includes a large fleet of vehicles and aircraft, as well as thousands of operating facilities. The sheer capital required to replicate this scale—estimated to be billions of dollars for a competitive infrastructure—creates an enormous, practically insurmountable barrier for new companies, even those with significant capital.
2.  **Economies of Scale and Cost Advantage:** Due to its massive network and high volume of packages (billions annually), UPS achieves durable cost advantages, making its cost-per-package lower than smaller competitors. The ability to operate more efficiently on a grand scale is a core competitive edge that is difficult for rivals to overcome.
3.  **Physical Network Effects:** The network itself becomes more valuable to all customers—both shippers and receivers—as it expands and serves more locations globally. A denser network means faster, more reliable, and more ubiquitous service, which attracts more customers, further increasing the network's value in a virtuous cycle.

### **Differentiation and Market Position**

4.  **Strategic Focus on Profitable Shipments:** UPS is strategically differentiating itself by moving away from low-margin, high-volume shippers (like some business with Amazon) toward high-value customers in sectors like healthcare logistics and small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This pivot stabilizes profit margins and diversifies revenue streams.
5.  **Specialized Healthcare Logistics:** The company has acquired specialized capabilities in the healthcare sector, which requires temperature-controlled storage and complex compliance with regulations like FDA guidelines. This specialization creates a significant regulatory barrier for rivals and offers a high-margin, sticky service.
6.  **Pricing Power:** UPS possesses strong pricing power due to its market leadership, reputation for reliability, and specialized service offerings. It utilizes a sophisticated, value-based pricing strategy that includes tiered options and peak season surcharges, allowing it to price based on the value delivered to the customer, not just the cost of service.
7.  **Ground Shipping Specialization:** Historically, UPS's competitive advantage has been in its freight and ground shipping services, where it maintains a large market share and fleet size, contrasting with competitors that might specialize more in air or residential mail.

### **Customer Stickiness and Contract Nature**

8.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** Substantially all of UPS's revenue comes from transportation and delivery contracts, which are a continuous, recurring need for businesses of all sizes. The customer retention rate is high, suggesting the cost and complexity of switching to a new carrier—including integrating new technology systems—creates significant switching costs for clients.
9.  **Enhancing Customer Retention with Digital Tools:** The company has created platforms like "UPS My Choice" to give consumers premium delivery flexibility and control, which boosts satisfaction and actively works to improve customer retention.

### **Innovation and Displacement Risk**

10. **Necessity of Constant Innovation:** UPS must constantly innovate to maintain its edge against its major rivals and adapt to new technologies and e-commerce trends. The company views technology and operations research as a core part of its competitive strategy.
11. **Technology as a Moat Builder (ORION System):** Significant technology investments have been made, such as the On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation (ORION) system, which uses complex operations research to optimize delivery routes. This system provides a consistent advantage by reducing operating costs and enhancing efficiency.
12. **Future-Proofing Investments:** UPS is actively investing in next-generation delivery technologies, including electric vehicles, drones, and exploring blockchain for supply chain transparency. These investments aim to lower its carbon footprint and operational costs, securing its future competitive position.
13. **High Difficulty of Displacement:** While competitors with greater capital could theoretically challenge UPS, displacing it is incredibly difficult because of the decades of investment in its integrated, globe-spanning physical and technological network. The barriers are not just financial, but also regulatory and logistical.
14. **Reason for Historical Growth:** The company grew into a global leader by recognizing market opportunities, such as the demand for global logistics, and making the strategic, capital-intensive decision to build its own airline for overnight and global shipping, rather than relying on commercial passenger airlines.

## Management Record

This analysis of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) management is structured for an investor's perspective, focusing primarily on the current CEO, Carol Tomé, and the strategic direction under her leadership.

### **Current CEO: Carol B. Tomé (Appointed 2020)**

1.  **Hiring and Background:** Carol Tomé became the CEO in June 2020, making her UPS's first female CEO and its first external CEO, a significant break from the company's tradition of promoting from within.
2.  **Pre-UPS Track Record:** She served as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of The Home Depot for nearly two decades (1995-2019), where she helped the company navigate the financial crisis and oversaw a 450% increase in shareholder value during her tenure.
3.  **Start of Tenure:** Her leadership began at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, immediately thrusting her into managing a global logistics crisis and positioning UPS for the delivery of the eventual COVID-19 vaccine.

### **Strategic Vision and Key Decisions**

4.  **Core Strategy:** Tomé is the architect of the "Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven" strategy, often summarized as a focus on being **"Better, Not Bigger."**
5.  **Focus on Profitability:** A key strategic decision was to prioritize profitable volume over sheer volume growth, a shift from previous management's focus on chasing market share.
6.  **Reducing Amazon Reliance:** Management announced a deliberate decision to accelerate the volume "glide down" with their largest customer, Amazon, aiming to reduce that volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026, as it was deemed less profitable.
7.  **High-Growth Market Focus:** The strategy involves aggressively growing share in premium segments like **Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs)**, aiming to grow this segment significantly, and expanding into the high-growth **healthcare logistics/cold chain** sector.
8.  **Labor Relations Success:** A critical win was the successful negotiation of a five-year contract with the Teamsters in 2023, which provided "win-win-win" certainty for the company, employees, and customers, avoiding a major strike.
9.  **Network and Efficiency Initiative:** The "Efficiency Reimagined" and "Network of the Future" initiatives aim to reconfigure the U.S. network, reduce the cost-to-serve, and generate approximately $1 billion in cost savings, including plans to close about 10% of buildings and expand automation to 400 facilities by the end of 2028.
10. **Cultural and People Initiatives:** She immediately altered company culture by changing long-standing restrictive policies, such as those regarding employee facial hair, tattoos, and natural hairstyles, to help UPS become an "employer of choice."

### **Management Performance and Shareholder Value**

11. **Delivery on Promises (Past):** In 2021, the company lived up to its long-term promises, achieving full-year results with decent revenue growth and a significant increase in operating profit (up 50% on a GAAP basis).
12. **Shareowner Returns:** Management has emphasized returning capital to shareholders, affirming its commitment to a stable and growing dividend, and returning billions of dollars through dividends and share repurchases.
13. **Recent Challenges and Investor View:** More recently, despite strategic shifts, UPS has faced revenue weakness and margin pressure due to market-wide soft demand, high labor costs following the new contract, and the planned reduction of Amazon volume.
14. **Analyst and Insider Sentiment:** Some analysts have downgraded the stock or issued a "Hold" rating due to near-term trading difficulties and the lack of a clear demand recovery in the B2B segment, though the CEO has shown confidence through significant insider stock purchases.

### **Previous Management Transition**

15. **Reason for Change:** The decision to hire Carol Tomé, an outsider, came after the Board, working with a third party, developed a "CEO scorecard of the future" that highlighted the need for new skills and attributes that the existing leadership team (under former CEO David Abney) did not fully meet, given the changing logistics industry landscape.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (UPS) recent definitive proxy statements (DEF 14A), here is an overview of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

1.  **Monetary Alignment is Present:** While the percentage is small for a company of UPS's size, the CEO's direct stock ownership is substantial in dollar value (e.g., approximately \$16–\$17 million for Carol Tomé). This represents a significant personal stake that directly rises and falls with the stock price.
2.  **Low Percentage of Total Shares:** The CEO's direct ownership is a very small fraction of total shares outstanding (e.g., approximately 0.023%). Although the dollar value is high, the overall control from insider ownership is minimal when viewed as a percentage of the company.

#### **Executive Compensation Structure**

3.  **Heavy Pay-for-Performance Skew:** UPS's compensation philosophy is designed to align a significant portion of executive pay with company performance, with the vast majority of total compensation being "at risk." The CEO's pay, for example, is heavily weighted toward stock awards and other incentives (over 90% in the most recent reported year) and only a small fraction is a fixed base salary.
4.  **Balanced Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Metrics:** The Long-Term Incentive Performance (LTIP) plan rewards executives over a three-year performance cycle using a balanced mix of metrics that support both operational and investor returns. Key metrics include Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, with Total Shareholder Return (TSR) acting as a modifier.
5.  **Risk Mitigation and Long-Term Focus:** The company prohibits executive officers and directors from hedging or pledging their UPS stock. This is a critical governance measure that ensures executives bear the full economic risk of stock ownership, thereby encouraging a long-term perspective.

#### **Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

6.  **Incentives are Predominantly Shareholder-Aligned:** The structure is fundamentally aligned with shareholder interests because the large majority of executive wealth is tied to long-term equity awards that only vest upon the achievement of objective financial (EPS, Free Cash Flow) and market-based (TSR modifier) metrics.
7.  **Potential for Discontent Exists:** Despite the well-designed structure, some sources indicate that the CEO's total compensation is significantly above the industry median, which has created a point of shareholder friction, especially given a period of negative shareholder returns and declining EPS. This suggests the link between pay and performance, while present, may not always satisfy shareholders in tough years.
8.  **Overall Assessment:** UPS's management team has a strong, policy-backed incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders, primarily due to the high percentage of at-risk, performance-vesting equity, the use of TSR/EPS/FCF metrics, and the prohibition on hedging. The management team's personal holdings are also substantial in dollar terms, further solidifying the alignment.

## Price History

Based on recent price history and technical analysis, here is an analysis of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS).

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading very close to its recent lows. With a recent close price of approximately **$84.41** (as of September 23, 2025) and a 52-week low of **$82.00**, the stock is trading approximately **2.94%** above its 52-week low.
2.  **Is UPS Trading Low (Technical Analysis)?** Yes, the stock is considered "beaten-down" and is trading near multi-year or pre-pandemic price levels. Technical indicators, like the overall rating on TradingView, show a prevailing "Sell" signal for the short-term (today to one month).
3.  **Potential for a Bounce:** Despite the negative short-term rating, the stock is trading near a longer-term support level, which some analysts believe increases the likelihood of a multi-week bounce. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also moving toward "oversold" levels, which can sometimes precede a price reversal.
4.  **Big Drop Explanation (Past Year):** The stock has seen a significant price drop, falling by more than **30%** year-to-date and over **36%** in the past year. This decline is mainly due to the logistics sector's struggle with lower volumes, a slowdown in e-commerce from the pandemic highs, and broader macroeconomic uncertainties.
5.  **Major Specific Headwinds:** Two major recent events contributed to the drops: in January 2025, the stock fell significantly after UPS announced a proactive move to substantially **cut low-margin volume with its largest customer, Amazon**, to improve overall profitability. Additionally, a nearly 10% drop occurred in July 2025 when the company **missed earnings expectations** and, citing a "dynamic and evolving trade environment," declined to provide full-year revenue guidance.
6.  **Valuation and Dividend:** The sharp decline has resulted in UPS offering a high trailing dividend yield of over **7.8%**, a factor that attracts some investors to the stock at its current low valuation.

## Long Thesis

The stock is currently trading at very low levels because of temporary problems, specifically the high cost of a new union contract and a recent slowdown in global shipping volumes. The bull case argues that United Parcel Service is now executing a massive, strategic turnaround that will lead to significantly higher, more stable profits in the coming years. In the near term (next 12-18 months), major cost-cutting initiatives and automation upgrades will save billions of dollars, leading to a strong return to profit growth. In the long term, management is intelligently shifting the company away from cheap, high-volume packages (like large Amazon shipments) toward higher-profit, specialized customers, specifically small businesses and complex healthcare logistics (like refrigerated medicine delivery). Because UPS owns an irreplaceable global delivery network, this strategic focus on 'Better, Not Bigger' will allow it to achieve premium pricing and superior profit margins, causing the stock, currently cheap, to recover sharply.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case depends on several key things happening perfectly: 1) Management must successfully meet its aggressive target of achieving billions of dollars in cost savings by automating its network and cutting staff. 2) The global economy must avoid a severe recession, allowing package volume to recover in the second half of the year. 3) UPS must successfully win enough high-profit business from small companies and healthcare clients to replace the volume it is purposefully shedding from low-margin customers. 4) The company's massive investment in healthcare logistics must secure a leading market position and generate the expected high profit margins.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for UPS has several critical assumptions and inherent risks that form a strong bear case, primarily related to execution risk, labor cost inflation, and aggressive competition.

### Flaws and Holes in the Bull Thesis (Critique)

1.  **Cost Savings are a Necessary Offset, Not Pure Profit Growth:** The "billions of dollars in cost savings" from automation and layoffs are largely an attempt to *neutralize* the massive, structural cost increase from the new five-year Teamsters union contract, estimated to add as much as **$20 billion in new operating expenses** over its life. The aggressive cost-cutting, including a targeted **$1 billion in savings** for 2024 and laying off 12,000 management employees, is therefore defensive and may not translate to a "strong return to profit growth" on a net basis as quickly as expected.

2.  **Labor Risk Remains High Despite the Contract:** The new union contract introduces significant long-term labor cost risk, and execution of management's cost-saving plans is already contested. The Teamsters Union has challenged UPS's voluntary separation and buyout programs, which are central to the cost-cutting strategy, creating a risk of legal penalties, labor disputes, and damage to workforce trust that could undermine operational stability.

3.  **The High-Profit Volume Shift is Slow and Painful:** The strategy to pivot to "Better, Not Bigger" requires purposefully shedding massive, low-margin volume (e.g., **Amazon plans to cut its UPS volume by over 50% by 2026**) and replacing it with higher-margin business. This transition is challenging, evidenced by the U.S. domestic revenue per piece decreasing due to a mix shift toward lighter packages and shorter zones, despite a slight overall volume recovery. Winning the highly fragmented small and medium-sized business (SMB) volume is a slow and competitive grind.

4.  **Healthcare Logistics Margins Are Under Pressure:** The "massive investment" in specialized healthcare logistics is not guaranteed to generate "superior profit margins" immediately. The broader Supply Chain Solutions segment, which includes this focus area, saw a significant **decrease in operating profit** year-over-year in Q2 2024, with an operating margin of only 7.3%, reflecting broader market pressures.

5.  **Competitive Threat from Amazon is Structural and Irreversible:** The bull case's reliance on UPS's "irreplaceable global delivery network" is challenged by Amazon's continued, strategic build-out of its own vast internal logistics network. Amazon's internal volume being reduced is a permanent structural headwind that will keep a lid on pricing power, capacity utilization, and future growth potential in the core e-commerce B2C segment.

---

### Bear Case Thesis: Structural Headwinds Offset Operational Gains

The near-term cost-cutting narrative is a mirage, as structural cost inflation from the union contract and irreversible volume loss from competition will neutralize its benefits, leading to prolonged margin pressure and limited growth.

1.  **The Cost-Labor-Automation Treadmill:** UPS is on a high-stakes treadmill where the multi-billion dollar costs from the new Teamsters contract will perpetually outpace the incremental gains from automation and management layoffs, leading to a flat or slow-growing net operating profit for the next 18-24 months.

2.  **Structural Volume Declines and Market Share Pressure:** The loss of significant volume from low-margin customers (like Amazon) is a permanent revenue headwind that cannot be quickly or fully offset by the slow, expensive process of onboarding enough high-margin SMB and healthcare customers, leaving the network with excess capacity and lower revenue utilization.

3.  **Pricing Power is Eroding Due to Competition:** In a soft economic environment with slow package volume recovery, the necessity of raising prices to cover union wage increases gives rivals like FedEx and a rapidly expanding Amazon Logistics an opportunity to undercut UPS on price and permanently capture market share.

4.  **The Valuation Trap of a "Turnaround":** The stock is not cheap relative to its *future* normalized earnings, as the "strategic turnaround" to higher margins is an expensive, multi-year process fraught with execution risk and labor instability, making the stock appear cheap on cyclically high past earnings, but expensive on lower, future normalized earnings.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis you've completed, the core of the bull/bear debate for UPS is centered on **execution risk** against powerful structural headwinds (labor cost inflation and Amazon's self-delivery network).

The next step is to investigate the most recent quarterly results (Q2 2025 and earlier mentions of Q3/Q4 2025) to quantify the current state of this battle and address the specific assumptions in your long thesis.

Here are the most important questions and investigation steps to take next:

### **1. Quantifying the Labor Cost vs. Efficiency Gain (The Profit Margin Battle)**

The key to the bull case is that cost savings will *outpace* the new union costs. We need a hard number on the net impact.

*   **Current Net Impact of Labor Costs:** Search for the Q2 2025 or most recent full quarter financial report and press release. Specifically, how much did the "increased compensation and benefits expense in our U.S. Domestic Package segment under our Teamsters contract" impact operating expenses and margin year-over-year?
*   **Progress of Cost-Cutting Initiatives:** Your data mentions a target of a $3.5 billion reduction in expenses for 2025. Investigate management's most recent guidance on how much of that has been realized to date (e.g., as of Q2 2025 or Q3 2025 update) and whether they are still on track for the full-year target.
*   **The Buyout Program's Success:** Search for updates on the voluntary separation/buyout programs, which are a central part of the cost-cutting plan. How many employees accepted the offer, and has the Teamsters Union's potential opposition had any material financial or operational impact?

### **2. Tracking the Strategic Pivot ("Better, Not Bigger" Execution)**

The bull case hinges on successfully replacing low-margin volume with high-margin volume (SMB and Healthcare). We need to verify the growth rates of these premium segments.

*   **Small and Medium-Sized Business (SMB) Growth:** Search for the latest quarter's reported *growth rate* in SMB volume or revenue. This is the single most important metric for validating the "Better, Not Bigger" domestic strategy. The SMB penetration rate reportedly reached 31.2% as of Q1 2025, but the acceleration needs to be checked.
*   **Healthcare Logistics Performance:** Investigate the recent revenue growth and, more importantly, the *operating margin* of the specialized Healthcare Logistics segment. Your bear case notes the broader Supply Chain Solutions segment saw margin pressure in Q2 2024. Has the recent acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group (Q2 2025) translated into improved margins or are the gains still being offset by other factors?
*   **The Amazon Volume Glide Down:** Verify the current status of the plan to reduce Amazon volume by over 50% by mid-2026. Is the volume loss consistent with management's internal projections, or is it accelerating/decelerating?

### **3. Competitive and Macroeconomic Environment**

The bear case argues for structural pressure on pricing and volume. We need a real-time view of the industry.

*   **FedEx’s Response to UPS's New Cost Structure:** Investigate the latest pricing movements of FedEx. Are they continuing to mirror UPS's General Rate Increases (GRIs), or is FedEx strategically undercutting UPS in specific premium B2B segments where UPS needs to grow the most? The 2025 GRIs for both carriers were reportedly 5.9%.
*   **Industrial/B2B Volume Outlook:** Search for the latest global or US package volume forecasts, specifically for the B2B or industrial segment, as this drives higher-margin freight revenue for UPS. Is the macro environment showing a confirmed and sustainable recovery, or are there still signs of trade uncertainty and slowing demand?
*   **The USPS/SurePost Transition:** Look for an update on the transition of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) air cargo volume to UPS, which is a near-term catalyst expected to begin in Q3 2025. How large is the expected revenue impact, and what are the associated ramp-up costs?
