### 2. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Forecast (2025-2030)

UHS's business engine is driven by two primary segments: **Acute Care Hospital Services** and **Behavioral Health Care Services**. Revenue growth is a function of:
1.  **Volume Growth (Adjusted Patient Days/Admissions):** Driven by population growth, market share gains in existing facilities, and new facility openings/expansions.
2.  **Pricing/Rate Increases (Net Revenue per Adjusted Admission):** Driven by contract negotiations with commercial payers, favorable payer mix, and government reimbursement rates (Medicare/Medicaid).

| Segment | Growth Driver | Q3 2025 Y/Y Performance | Forward-Looking Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute Care** | Volume & Pricing | Same facility net revenues increased by 12.8% Y/Y. Same facility adjusted admissions up 2%. | Expecting same facility-adjusted patient day growth of 2% to 3% near-term. Continued CapEx on new hospitals (e.g., Florida, California). |
| **Behavioral Health** | Volume & Pricing | Same facility net revenues increased by 7.9% for the first nine months of 2025. Modest volume improvement. | Labor tightness improving steadily. Focus on new beds and facility expansions. |

**Revenue Growth Assumptions (Conservative Engine Model):**

The high growth rates in 2025 reflect post-pandemic normalization, strong pricing, and supplemental payments. A conservative model should project a deceleration to a more sustainable long-term growth rate.

*   **2025 (Full Year):** Assume LTM Revenue of \$17.38B represents a high watermark due to the one-time impact of supplemental payments and strong post-COVID recovery. A full year revenue of **\$17.20 Billion** is projected (approximately 10.1% Y/Y growth from FY2024 est.).
*   **2026-2027 (Near-Term Growth):** Assume volume growth of **2.5%** (mid-range of management guidance) and pricing/payer mix/new facility contribution of **3.5%**, for a total annual revenue growth of **6.0%**. This reflects continued strength in Behavioral Health and steady Acute Care expansion.
*   **2028-2030 (Mid-Term Growth):** Assume growth decelerates as the labor market stabilizes and new facility growth moderates. Annual revenue growth is conservatively set at **5.0%**.

**Revenue Projections (in Billions USD)**

| Year | Revenue (Billions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$17.20 | 10.1% (Est.) | Based on 9M 2025 reported revenue and Q4 estimate. |
| **2026** | \$18.23 | 6.0% | Volume (2.5%) + Pricing/Expansion (3.5%). |
| **2027** | \$19.32 | 6.0% | Continuation of near-term tailwinds. |
| **2028** | \$20.29 | 5.0% | Conservative moderation as market normalizes. |
| **2029** | \$21.31 | 5.0% | Consistent mid-term growth. |
| **2030** | \$22.38 | 5.0% | Steady-state industry growth. |

### 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

UHS's profitability has improved significantly. The Q3 2025 adjusted net income margin was approximately 8.04% (\$362.3M net income on \$4.5B revenue). The LTM Net Margin (using estimated LTM figures) is approximately $7.3\%$.

**Net Income Margin Assumption:**
The valuation assumes that cost pressures (primarily labor) will continue to moderate (as per management commentary), but a conservative long-term margin is necessary. A Net Income Margin of **7.5%** is used for all projected years, reflecting a slight improvement over the LTM but remaining conservative against the recent high-performance quarter (Q3 2025).

**Net Income Projections (in Billions USD)**

| Year | Revenue (Billions USD) | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income (A) (Billions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$17.20 | 7.5% | \$1.290 |
| **2026** | \$18.23 | 7.5% | \$1.367 |
| **2027** | \$19.32 | 7.5% | \$1.449 |
| **2028** | \$20.29 | 7.5% | \$1.522 |
| **2029** | \$21.31 | 7.5% | \$1.598 |
| **2030** | \$22.38 | 7.5% | \$1.678 |

### 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Total Net Income

**ROIC Assumption:**
The instruction requires an ROIC-based additional income calculation. UHS has historically demonstrated an ability to generate returns on its capital. Given the projected positive net income, a conservative but reasonable ROIC of **10.0%** is applied to the prior year's Net Income (cash) to model additional income generated from reinvested profits.

*   **2025 Starting Cash (from 2024/LTM Net Income):** \$1.27 billion (LTM Est.)

| Year | Operating Net Income (A) (Billions USD) | Start-of-Year Cash (B) (Billions USD) | ROIC Additional Income (B * 10%) (C) (Billions USD) | Total Net Income (A+C) (Billions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1.290 | \$1.270 | \$0.127 | **\$1.417** |
| **2026** | \$1.367 | \$1.417 | \$0.142 | **\$1.509** |
| **2027** | \$1.449 | \$1.509 | \$0.151 | **\$1.600** |
| **2028** | \$1.522 | \$1.600 | \$0.160 | **\$1.682** |
| **2029** | \$1.598 | \$1.682 | \$0.168 | **\$1.766** |
| **2030** | \$1.678 | \$1.766 | \$0.177 | **\$1.855** |

### 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Total Net Income for each year is treated as the projected free cash flow to the firm.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable discount rate of **9.0%** is used. This is a high rate for a stable healthcare company but reflects current higher interest rate environments and general market risk.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** A conservative long-term growth rate of **2.0%** is applied after 2030, reflecting long-term US healthcare spending growth and inflation.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (End of 2030):**
*   TV = [2030 Total Net Income \* (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV = [\$1.855B \* (1 + 0.02)] / (0.09 - 0.02)
*   TV = \$1.8921B / 0.07 = **\$27.030 Billion**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (FCF) (Billions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.09) ^ t) | Net Present Value (Billions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | \$1.417 | 0.9174 | \$1.300 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | \$1.509 | 0.8417 | \$1.270 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | \$1.600 | 0.7722 | \$1.236 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | \$1.682 | 0.7084 | \$1.192 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | \$1.766 | 0.6499 | \$1.148 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | \$1.855 | 0.5963 | \$1.107 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | \$27.030 | 0.5963 | \$16.110 |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$23.363 Billion** |

### 6. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of the stock is calculated using the following formula:

**Fair Value = (NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Cash & Equivalents - Total Debt) / Shares Outstanding**

| Metric | Value (USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Future Cash Flows (A) | \$23.363 Billion |
| Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (B) | \$0.113 Billion |
| Total Debt (C) | \$4.690 Billion |
| Net Equity Value (A + B - C) | **\$18.786 Billion** |
| Shares Outstanding (D) | 64,000,000 |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Net Equity / D)** | **\$293.53** |

### 7. Justification and Conclusion

#### Final Valuation Result:

The intrinsic fair value of Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) stock is calculated to be **\$293.53 per share**.

#### Justification for Discrepancy with Market Price:

*   **Fair Value:** \$293.53
*   **Current Market Price:** \$233.93
*   **Difference:** $25.5\%$ higher than the market price.

The calculated Fair Value is significantly higher than the current market price, suggesting the stock is undervalued based on the model's assumptions. The difference can be justified by the market making more conservative assumptions about one or more of the following key inputs:

1.  **Revenue Growth De-rating:** The market may be assuming a faster and deeper deceleration in revenue growth than the projected **6.0% (2026-2027)** and **5.0% (2028-2030)**. Investors may view the strong Q3 2025 growth as unsustainable, particularly due to the temporary nature of some supplemental Medicaid payments.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The market may believe that the structural labor challenges, while improving, will keep margins compressed below the conservative **7.5%** net income margin used in this model. Persistent inflation in clinical staff wages is a major industry concern that could prevent a full margin recovery.
3.  **Discount Rate/Risk Premium:** The market's assumed cost of capital (Discount Rate) for UHS might be higher than the **9.0%** used here, reflecting higher perceived regulatory risk, reimbursement risk (especially with government programs), or a greater uncertainty around future capital deployment (CapEx efficiency). A higher discount rate (e.g., 10.0%) would significantly lower the NPV and Fair Value.

**Conclusion:** Our conservative business engine model, backed by management's commentary on volume and pricing strength in Acute Care and Behavioral Health, and a long-term **7.5%** net margin, suggests a significant upside to the current stock price. The market appears to be excessively discounting UHS's future earnings power, likely due to a conservative outlook on long-term margin stability and sustained high single-digit revenue growth.
