## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The Western Union business engine is shifting from a traditional cash-based remittance business to a "Digital-First" and "Beyond" strategy, aiming for a global financial services network. The revenue forecast is conservatively built using management's specific, medium-term targets and then decelerating.

**Business Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Digital/Consumer Services Growth:** The core engine relies on the acceleration of the Branded Digital business (transactions up 9%-12%, revenue up 6% in 2025 snippets) and the Consumer Services division (expected double-digit revenue growth). The strategy is to shift to higher-margin digital/account-to-account (A2A) flows and diversify beyond traditional remittances (the 'Beyond' strategy, including products like USDPT stablecoin).
2.  **Retail Headwinds:** The legacy retail business is expected to continue facing pressure from geopolitical issues and digital competition, as noted in the earnings calls.
3.  **Conservative Target Achievement:** We use the mid-point of the company's publicly stated 2028 revenue target (\$4.8B - \$5.3B $\rightarrow$ \$5.0B) but apply a highly conservative deceleration post-2028.

| Year | Revenue (Billions) | Calculation / Justification | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$4.05 | Mid-point of management's adjusted revenue guidance (\$4.0B - \$4.1B) [cite: 10 from step 1]. | - |
| **2026** | \$4.33 | 7.0% growth on 2025 revenue. This is slightly below the 7.3% CAGR required to hit the 2028 target, providing an initial conservative buffer while still relying on management's guided ramp-up. | 7.00% |
| **2027** | \$4.64 | 7.0% growth on 2026 revenue. | 7.00% |
| **2028** | \$4.96 | 7.0% growth on 2027 revenue. This brings the revenue to the edge of the management's mid-point target of $5.0B, reflecting a near-miss/conservative achievement. | 7.00% |
| **2029** | \$5.11 | Highly conservative deceleration. Growth halved to 3.0% to reflect maturity and intense competition pressure, assuming the "Beyond" strategy's initial boost wanes. | 3.00% |
| **2030** | \$5.27 | Continued conservative 3.0% growth. | 3.00% |

## 3. Margin Projections and Net Income (2025-2030)

**Net Income Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **2025 Margin (Guidance-Implied):** Management's 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance (\$1.65 - \$1.75) [cite: 10 from step 1] implies a Net Income margin significantly lower than the 22.2% reported in FY 2024 (which may include one-time items). Using the mid-point of the EPS guidance on $4.05B revenue gives an NI of ~$540.3M, or a margin of **13.3%** ($\text{\$540.3M} / \text{\$4050M}$). This conservative figure is used to start the forecast.
2.  **2028 Margin (Target-Implied):** Management's 2028 Adjusted EPS target (\$2.30) on the projected \$4.96B revenue gives an NI of $\text{\$731.0M}$, or a margin of **14.7\%** ($\text{\$731.0M} / \text{\$4960M}$).
3.  **Long-Term Margin:** Net Margin is held steady at **14.7%** post-2028. The long-term upside from cost efficiencies and a shift to a higher-margin digital business is conservatively offset by continued pricing pressure in the remittance market.

**ROIC Assumption:**

*   **ROIC (Historical TTM):** 30.70%. This figure is extremely high due to a low equity base.
*   **ROIC (Conservative for Valuation):** A reasonable and conservative ROIC of **6.0%** is used on accumulated net income/cash (as per the rule), reflecting a modest and sustainable return on re-invested capital and cash reserves.

**Net Income (NI) Projection:**

| Year | Revenue (M) | Net Margin (%) | NI from Operations (M) | ROIC on Prior Year Cash (M) | Total Net Income (M) | Cash for Next Year (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (A)** | \$4,200 (FY) [cite: 11 from step 2] | 22.2% | \$934.2 | N/A | \$934.2 | \$934.2 |
| **2025 (E)** | \$4,050 | 13.3% | \$540.3 | N/A | \$540.3 | \$540.3 |
| **2026 (E)** | \$4,330 | 13.8% | \$597.5 | \$32.4 | \$629.9 | \$1,170.2 |
| **2027 (E)** | \$4,640 | 14.3% | \$663.5 | \$70.2 | \$733.7 | \$1,903.9 |
| **2028 (E)** | \$4,960 | 14.7% | \$729.1 | \$114.2 | \$843.3 | \$2,747.2 |
| **2029 (E)** | \$5,110 | 14.7% | \$751.2 | \$164.8 | \$916.0 | \$3,663.2 |
| **2030 (E)** | \$5,270 | 14.7% | \$775.0 | \$219.8 | \$994.8 | \$4,658.0 |

*   *NI from Operations* = Revenue * Net Margin
*   *ROIC on Prior Year Cash* = Cash for Previous Year * 6.0% (Note: Cash is accumulated Net Income from the prior year. For 2026, the accumulated cash is $\text{\$934.2M}$ for 2024 and $\text{\$540.3M}$ for 2025. The instruction states "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year," which is then subject to ROIC for the year after. Therefore, the 2026 ROIC is calculated on the 2025 Net Income: $\text{\$540.3M} \times 6.0\% = \text{\$32.4M}$). However, the most conservative interpretation of the rule: "ROIC from net income got from previous year" is used. For this DCF, we will treat **Total Net Income** as the **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** proxy for the simple valuation model as instructed.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

**Valuation Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | 7.00% | A conservative rate, slightly above the reported 5.81% WACC [cite: 10 from step 2] to account for future risk in a rapidly changing industry. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | 1.50% | A very conservative maturity rate, significantly below the projected 3.0% long-term growth and global GDP, reflecting the competitive nature of the market. |

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

The Net Income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) as per the instruction's simplified model.

| Year | Total Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (7.00%) | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$540.3 | 0.9346 | \$504.9 |
| **2026** | \$629.9 | 0.8734 | \$550.2 |
| **2027** | \$733.7 | 0.8163 | \$599.3 |
| **2028** | \$843.3 | 0.7629 | \$643.3 |
| **2029** | \$916.0 | 0.7130 | \$652.9 |
| **2030** | \$994.8 | 0.6663 | \$662.9 |
| **Sum of Projected FCFF** | | | **\$3,613.5** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the 2030 FCF projection and the perpetuity growth formula (FCF \* (1 + g) / (WACC - g)).

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{\$994.8M} \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.0700 - 0.0150} = \text{\$18,367.7M}$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value:**

$$\text{PV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \text{\$18,367.7M} \times 0.6663 = \text{\$12,236.4M}$$

**Total Net Present Value (Enterprise Value):**

$$\text{Total NPV (Enterprise Value)} = \text{Sum of Projected FCFF} + \text{PV of TV}$$
$$\text{Total NPV (Enterprise Value)} = \text{\$3,613.5M} + \text{\$12,236.4M} = \text{\$15,849.9M}$$

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Enterprise Value} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

| Metric | Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enterprise Value (NPV)** | \$15,849.9 |
| **(+) Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$947.8 |
| **(-) Total Debt** | \$2,600.0 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$14,197.7** |
| **Divided by Shares Outstanding** | 317.84 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$44.67** |

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of WU Stock

The calculated conservative intrinsic **Fair Value per Share** for The Western Union Company (WU) is **\$44.67**.

### Justification for Fair Value vs. Market Value

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$44.67** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$9.67** |
| **Variance** | **461%** |

The enormous discrepancy between the calculated Fair Value and the Current Market Price is primarily due to the market's severe skepticism about the company's ability to achieve its **2028 Revenue and EPS targets** and, more importantly, the market's perception of the **sustainability and predictability of its future Free Cash Flow (FCF)**.

**Why My Assumptions Differ from the Market's (And Why the Market is Discounting WU):**

1.  **Terminal Decline Assumption:** The market likely bakes in a secular decline or a *zero/negative* long-term growth rate for Western Union's core remittance business. The market views WU as a **melting ice cube** whose legacy retail network is being rapidly replaced by fintech competitors (e.g., Remitly, Wise) with better pricing and user experience.
2.  **Uncertainty of the "Beyond" Strategy:** My valuation assumes management *will* achieve its 2028 revenue goal of nearly \$5.0B and the corresponding 14.7% net margin. The market, however, is likely assigning a very low probability to the successful execution of the "Beyond" digital strategy, the high double-digit growth in Consumer Services, and the successful pivot into digital assets (USDPT stablecoin).
3.  **Risk Premium (Discount Rate):** While I used a conservative 7.0% discount rate, the market's required rate of return for WU is likely much higher (perhaps 10-12% or more) due to:
    *   **High Business Risk:** Extreme competitive pressure and exposure to volatile global remittance markets and regulation.
    *   **Financial Risk:** The high debt-to-equity ratio (approx. 2.8x) and limited financial flexibility.
4.  **ROIC on Cash:** My calculation includes a **6.0% ROIC** on accumulated cash, which adds significant value in the outer years ($\text{\$219.8M}$ in 2030 alone). The market may not give credit for this, assuming any excess cash is simply returned as dividends or buybacks, or that the return on internal investment will be near-zero.

**Conclusion:**

My valuation suggests Western Union is **significantly undervalued** based on the explicit guidance provided by management for the next five years. For the stock to be priced at **\$9.67**, the market is making one or both of the following assumptions:

*   **A "No Growth, Low Margin" Scenario:** Assuming a terminal value with a $\text{0\%}$ (or even negative) Terminal Growth Rate *and* a much higher Discount Rate (e.g., 10-12%).
*   **A Failure of Strategy:** Assuming management fails to meet its 2028 $\text{\$5.0B}$ revenue target and its associated profitability, with revenue remaining flat or declining from 2025 onwards.

The valuation of **\$44.67** is the fair value **if and only if** the management's "Beyond" strategy is successfully executed and the company can achieve its long-term growth and margin targets, which is a major, yet management-guided, assumption.
