## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Western Union's business is transitioning from a traditional, high-margin, cash-based retail model to a lower-margin, digital-first financial services platform (the **Evolve 2025 strategy**).

### Business Engine Assumptions

1.  **Core Retail (Headwind):** The traditional retail money transfer business is declining due to competition from digital-only and lower-cost competitors. This decline is largely offset by cost management and retail stabilization efforts in key regions.
2.  **Digital/Consumer Services (Growth Engine):** The company's growth is driven by its Branded Digital business (6% revenue growth, 12% transaction growth in Q3 2025) and the expansion of Consumer Services, notably the Travel Money business (49% revenue growth in Q3 2025).
3.  **Strategic Acquisition (Intermex):** The pending acquisition of International Money Express, Inc. (Intermex), expected to close in mid-2026, will boost revenue, particularly in the critical US-Mexico corridor. Intermex revenue in 2024 was $\approx$ $638$ million (Based on its filings, not explicitly in the WU search results, but used for modeling the impact of the $\approx$ $500$ million cash acquisition). For conservatism, I will model a lower impact to WU's total revenue.
4.  **Long-Term Headwinds:** The company faces a historical revenue decline of $\sim 3.4\%$ annually over the last five years, which frames the conservative approach. Regulatory risks, such as a potential 1% remittance tax in 2026, also dampen long-term growth prospects.

### Revenue Projection Justification

The projection builds from the 2025 guidance and incorporates the strategic growth drivers with conservative deceleration due to core business headwinds and long-term saturation/competition.

| Year | Revenue (Midpoint) / Growth Assumption | Revenue (USD Billion) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Baseline) | TTM Revenue $\approx$ $4.1$ B | 4.100 | TTM Revenue estimate (Q3 2025 filing) |
| **2025** | Management Guidance Midpoint (4.035B - 4.135B) | 4.085 | **-0.4%** growth, slightly below $4.1$ B baseline for conservatism. |
| **2026** | **2.5% Growth** | 4.187 | Assumes core decline stabilization, continued 6-8% branded digital growth, and the **Intermex acquisition** (estimated $\sim$ $100$ million in annualized revenue contribution, prorated for a mid-2026 close, which is conservative given Intermex's size). |
| **2027** | **1.5% Growth** | 4.250 | Assumes a full-year benefit from the acquisition and continued growth in Consumer Services/Digital, but tempered by the secular decline in core retail and competitive pressure. |
| **2028** | **1.0% Growth** | 4.292 | Digital growth is partially saturated, and the core business continues its gradual decline. |
| **2029** | **0.5% Growth** | 4.313 | Growth slows as the transition stabilizes. |
| **2030** | **0.0% Growth** (Maturity) | 4.313 | Assumes a full maturity/stable state with no net growth. |

## 3. Margin Projections & Net Income Calculation

### Margin Assumptions

*   **Gross Margin (GM):** Historically strong, recently cited at $37.7\%$ (Q3 2025). The shift to digital may slightly depress this long-term due to higher partner commission rates, but I will maintain it.
*   **Adjusted Operating Margin (Op. Margin):** Management guides to a 19%-21% range for 2025. The company has completed its cost redeployment program two years ahead of schedule, which supports margin expansion. I will use the current $20\%$ as a stable, conservative projection.
*   **Net Income Margin:** TTM Net Margin is $21.84\%$, which is high partly due to a low Q3 2025 tax rate (12%). I will use the $20\%$ Adjusted Operating Margin and apply a conservative 20% tax rate (higher than the recent 12% to account for less discrete benefits in the future). This results in a $\approx 16\%$ Net Income Margin.
*   **Net Income Margin (Projection):** $16\%$ for all years.

### Net Income Calculation (Simplified)

| Year | Revenue (B) | Op. Margin (20%) | Operating Income (B) | Tax Rate (20%) | Net Income Margin (16%) | Net Income (A) (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 4.085 | 20.0% | 0.817 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.654 |
| **2026** | 4.187 | 20.0% | 0.837 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.670 |
| **2027** | 4.250 | 20.0% | 0.850 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.680 |
| **2028** | 4.292 | 20.0% | 0.858 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.687 |
| **2029** | 4.313 | 20.0% | 0.863 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.690 |
| **2030** | 4.313 | 20.0% | 0.863 | 20.0% | 16.0% | 0.690 |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation (Modified per Rules)

The user's instruction for Net Income is: **Net income for next year = net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year.**

*   The company's past ROIC is difficult to calculate without full historical balance sheets, but its business model is capital-light. Given this, I will select a conservative, positive Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **5.0%**. This is a reasonable, positive return on retained earnings, reflecting the company's ability to re-invest its cash flow at a low rate.
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**. This reflects a high-risk premium for a company in a secularly challenged industry, undergoing a strategic transformation.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **-1.0%** (Negative 1%). Given the secular decline in the core business and intense competition, assuming a terminal growth rate below zero (i.e., a slow decline) is the most conservative and justified approach for the mature cash-based remittance business.

### Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) & NPV

The Net Income from the previous year is assumed to turn into cash, which then generates a return (ROIC) in the subsequent year.

| Year (t) | Net Income (A) (B) (Original) | Prior NI\*ROIC (C) (B) | Total Net Income / CF (A+C) (B) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 0.654 | 0.000 (Initial Year) | 0.654 | 0.909 | 0.595 |
| **2026** | 0.670 | 0.033 (0.654 \* 5.0%) | 0.703 | 0.826 | 0.581 |
| **2027** | 0.680 | 0.035 (0.703 \* 5.0%) | 0.715 | 0.751 | 0.537 |
| **2028** | 0.687 | 0.036 (0.715 \* 5.0%) | 0.723 | 0.683 | 0.493 |
| **2029** | 0.690 | 0.036 (0.723 \* 5.0%) | 0.726 | 0.621 | 0.451 |
| **2030** | 0.690 | 0.036 (0.726 \* 5.0%) | 0.727 | 0.564 | 0.410 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | **3.067 Billion** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)

The **Terminal Value (TV)** is calculated at the end of 2030 using the 2030 cash flow as the starting point for a perpetuity.

$$
\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{TV} = \frac{0.727 \text{ Billion} \times (1 + (-0.01))}{0.10 - (-0.01)} = \frac{0.727 \times 0.99}{0.11} = 6.541 \text{ Billion}
$$

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the Terminal Value is calculated by discounting the TV back to today (Year 0).

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \frac{\text{TV}}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^{\text{Years}}} = \frac{6.541 \text{ Billion}}{(1.10)^6} = 3.690 \text{ Billion}
$$

**Total Equity Value (Enterprise Value):**
$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$$
$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$3.067 \text{ Billion} + \$3.690 \text{ Billion} = \$6.757 \text{ Billion}$$

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The final valuation is calculated by subtracting Total Debt and adding back Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (Net Debt adjustment) from the Total Equity Value, and then dividing by the Shares Outstanding.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Equity Value (NPV) | 6,757.0 million |
| Less: Total Debt | (2,592.2) million |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | 947.8 million |
| **Fair Value of Common Equity** | **5,112.6 million** |
| Shares Outstanding | 317.84 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$16.08** |

---

## Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value: **$16.08**
### Current Stock Price: **$9.33**

### Justification for Fair Value Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **$16.08** per share is significantly higher than the current market price of **$9.33** per share. The market is making far more conservative assumptions than even this model's cautious estimates.

**Why the Market is Discounting the Stock (Assumptions the Market is Making):**

1.  **Terminal Decline (Not Stabilization):** The market likely assumes that the secular decline in the core retail business is not stoppable or even containable at a $-0.4\%$ growth rate (as modeled for 2025) but rather a continuous, accelerating decline (e.g., $-5\%$ to $-10\%$ per year for the next decade) that will overwhelm any growth from the Digital/Consumer Services segments.
2.  **Failed Acquisition Synergy/Integration Risk:** The Intermex acquisition is a bet on a key corridor. The market may be skeptical of Western Union's ability to successfully integrate and realize the synergies, pricing the risk of a value-destroying acquisition.
3.  **Low or Zero ROIC:** The market's valuation implies a belief that the company's retained earnings (Net Income converted to cash) will generate a very low to negative return (ROIC) due to poor capital allocation or a high-churn, low-margin competitive environment in digital money transfer.
4.  **Higher Discount Rate:** A significantly higher implied discount rate is being used. For example, if we were to back-calculate the discount rate that makes the Fair Value equal to the current price of $9.33, it would be substantially higher than the $10\%$ used here, reflecting an extreme level of risk aversion.

**Justification for the Fair Value (Why the Model is Higher):**

1.  **Business Transformation Success:** My model assumes the *Evolve 2025* strategy succeeds in stabilizing the core business and that the digital/consumer services segment can maintain mid-single-digit growth and better margins, which is supported by the management commentary and the Q3 2025 results (Branded Digital revenue growth of 6-7%, Consumer Services growth of 49%).
2.  **Value of Free Cash Flow:** Even with negative long-term growth (Maturity Rate of $-1\%$), the model recognizes the substantial cash flows the company generates from its established, wide-reach network (evidenced by the strong $20\%$ Adjusted Operating Margin). The market may be over-discounting the value of this consistent, high-margin cash flow.
3.  **Conservative Debt/Cash Treatment:** The DCF model uses Net Income as a proxy for cash flow, and then adjusts for Net Debt in the final step. Western Union has a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity (Cash $947.8M$) and manageable debt, which my model fully accounts for, whereas the market may be implicitly applying a high-interest risk to the debt load.

**Conclusion:** The market is pricing Western Union as a company in terminal decline with high execution risk on its digital transformation. My model, while conservative in its revenue growth projections and using a conservative $10\%$ discount rate, believes the Evolve 2025 strategy, bolstered by the Intermex acquisition, will at least stabilize the business to a low single-digit growth/flat-line and that the company can generate a positive return on its substantial cash flows, justifying a fair value nearly double the current stock price.
