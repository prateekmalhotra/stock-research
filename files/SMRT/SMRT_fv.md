## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine of SmartRent is the installation of smart home **Units Deployed** (installed base) which then generates **SaaS Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** through its subscription-based software platform (the high-margin part of the business) and lower-margin **Hardware Revenue**. The company is focused on a strategic shift to a SaaS-centric model, moving away from low-margin bulk hardware sales.

**Key Engine Metrics (Q3 2025 Baseline):**
*   **Units Deployed:** 870,230 (11% YoY growth)
*   **ARR:** $56.9 million (7% YoY growth)
*   **Property Net Revenue Retention (ARPU Driver):** 104% (indicating modest upsell/cross-sell)

### Revenue Assumptions

| Year | Units Deployed Growth (YoY %) | SaaS ARPU Growth (YoY %) | Hardware Revenue Growth (YoY %) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | 10.0% | 5.0% | 0.0% | Conservative reduction from 11% installed base growth to account for market maturation. ARPU growth is a conservative proxy for 104% NRR/upsell. Hardware is assumed flat as the company de-emphasizes low-margin sales. |
| **2027** | 9.0% | 4.0% | 2.0% | Further conservatism in unit growth. ARPU moderates. Hardware begins a slight recovery as a necessary component of the SaaS platform. |
| **2028** | 8.0% | 3.0% | 3.0% | Growth moderates but remains strong. |
| **2029** | 7.0% | 2.0% | 3.0% | Growth moderates. |
| **2030** | 6.0% | 2.0% | 3.0% | Growth converges to a conservative long-term rate. |

### Revenue Calculation (in millions)

| Metric | 2025E | 2026P | 2027P | 2028P | 2029P | 2030P |

*Note: 2025E is an estimated run-rate based on Q3/Q4 guidance; ARPU is calculated from $58.9M ARR / 900k Units.*

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

Management has guided to run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Neutrality exiting 2025, driven by a $30 million annualized cost reduction program. This is the key assumption for profitability.

*   **SaaS Gross Margin:** Historically around 70% (Q2 2025 data).
*   **Hardware Gross Margin:** Low single-digit margin is assumed, consistent with the company's efforts to deemphasize this segment.
*   **Net Income Margin:** The cost reductions and shift to SaaS are expected to drive profitability quickly. A conservative path to a long-term Net Income Margin of **12%** is assumed by 2030, a typical range for mature, growing SaaS businesses.

| Metric | 2025E | 2026P | 2027P | 2028P | 2029P | 2030P |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | $142.9 | $152.0 | $162.8 | $174.1 | $184.7 | $195.0 |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | (2.5%) | 1.0% | 4.0% | 7.0% | 10.0% | 12.0% |
| **Projected Net Income** | **($3.6)** | **$1.5** | **$6.5** | **$12.2** | **$18.5** | **$23.4** |
*Note: 2025 Net Income is assumed to be a Net Loss of -$3.6M, in line with Q4 2025 Net Loss guidance.*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The DCF is calculated based on the Net Income as a proxy for unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF), as guided by the instruction to assume net income goes straight into cash.

**Key Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%** (Conservative and reasonable rate for a high-growth, technology-focused company moving towards profitability).
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **3.0%** (Assumes long-term growth will converge with a modest premium over US GDP growth).
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** **5.0%** (A conservative, positive ROIC is applied to the prior year's accumulated cash balance, as required, even though the historical ROIC is negative due to current losses. This is an interest-on-cash/short-term investments proxy).

**Net Income (Cash Flow) with ROIC Adjustment (in millions):**

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) | Accumulated Cash from Prior Year (B) | ROIC Income (B * 5.0%) (C) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) (D) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) of Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $1.5 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $1.5 | 0.909 | $1.4 |
| **2027** | $6.5 | $1.5 | $0.1 | $6.6 | 0.826 | $5.5 |
| **2028** | $12.2 | $8.1 | $0.4 | $12.6 | 0.751 | $9.5 |
| **2029** | $18.5 | $20.7 | $1.0 | $19.5 | 0.683 | $13.3 |
| **2030** | $23.4 | $40.2 | $2.0 | $25.4 | 0.621 | $15.8 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Flows** | | | | | | **$45.5 million** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The cash flow in 2030 is projected to be $25.4 million. This is used in the perpetuity formula to find the Terminal Value:

$$ \text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} $$

$$ \text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$25.4 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{\$26.16 \text{M}}{0.07} = \$373.7 \text{M} $$

### Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value

The Terminal Value must be discounted back to the present (Year 0):

$$ \text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{2030}} $$

$$ \text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \$373.7 \text{M} \times 0.621 = \mathbf{\$232.1 \text{ million}} $$

### Total Enterprise Value (NPV)

$$ \text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV of Projected Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} $$

$$ \text{Total NPV} = \$45.5 \text{M} + \$232.1 \text{M} = \mathbf{\$277.6 \text{ million}} $$

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value of Equity

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$277.6 \text{M} + \$100.0 \text{M} - \$0.0 \text{M} = \mathbf{\$377.6 \text{ million}} $$

### Fair Value Per Share

$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$377.6 \text{ million}}{189.2 \text{ million shares}} = \mathbf{\$1.99} $$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of SmartRent, Inc. (SMRT) Stock

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$1.99** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$1.75** |

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share of $1.99** is approximately 13.7% higher than the current market price of $1.75.

### Justification of Difference (Fair Value vs. Market Price)

The market is currently valuing SMRT at a slight discount to the calculated intrinsic value, but the two are relatively close, suggesting the market largely agrees with the company's trajectory towards profitability.

The primary assumptions where the market might be more conservative than this model are:

1.  **SaaS Revenue Conversion Risk:** While management has stated a commitment to cash flow neutrality and a shift to SaaS, the market remains cautious about the *timing* and *consistency* of this high-margin revenue growth. The market may be discounting the stock due to the historical decline in total revenue (down 11% YoY in Q3 2025) as the company transitions away from hardware. This model assumes the Unit Deployed growth (11% YoY) translates efficiently into SaaS ARPU and Net Income, which still carries execution risk.
2.  **Long-Term Margin & ROIC:** This model assumes a smooth and steady path to a **12% Net Income Margin** by 2030, which is a reasonable but optimistic long-term target for a SaaS-focused business. It also uses a guaranteed, positive **5.0% ROIC** on retained earnings. The market's implied valuation suggests a slightly lower long-term margin or a higher discount rate (reflecting higher risk).
3.  **Future Competition:** The market might be factoring in greater competitive pressure in the PropTech space, which could compress the long-term growth rate ($\text{g}=3.0\%$) or the Net Income Margin.

**Overall Justification:** The fair value of $1.99$ is conservative and well-supported by the company's metrics: a debt-free balance sheet, a large and growing installed base (870K+ units), and clear management guidance towards cost discipline and a positive cash flow run rate exiting 2025. The marginal difference indicates that the market is a "show me" market, waiting for a few quarters of consistent, positive Adjusted EBITDA and SaaS revenue acceleration before fully valuing the company's stated long-term potential.
