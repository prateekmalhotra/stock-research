## I. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for SmartRent is its transition from a hardware-heavy model to a high-margin **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** and Hosted Services platform. The revenue is split into two primary components:

1.  **SaaS/Hosted Revenue:** Driven by the **Units Deployed (UD)** and **Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)**. This is the high-margin, predictable, recurring revenue stream.
2.  **Hardware/Professional Services Revenue:** Non-recurring, low-margin revenue that the company is strategically scaling down.

### Engine Assumptions:

*   **Units Deployed (UD) & Growth:** As of Q2 2025, UD is 850,000, growing at 10% YoY. The company is deployed with 15 of the top 20 multi-family owners, suggesting a strong but maturing core market presence. I will assume a conservative growth deceleration to reflect market saturation and macroeconomic headwinds:
    *   **2026-2027:** **10.0%** annual growth.
    *   **2028-2030:** **7.0%** annual growth.
*   **SaaS ARPU & Growth:** Q2 2025 ARPU is **$5.66/month** or **$67.92/year**. This is projected to increase modestly due to platform capability expansion, new feature monetization, and disciplined pricing.
    *   **2026-2030:** **3.0%** annual ARPU increase.
*   **Hardware/Services Revenue (The 'Exit'):** The strategic shift is away from low-margin bulk hardware sales, which caused a 39% YoY drop in Q2 2025. I will project a severe contraction until it stabilizes as a percentage of the recurring revenue base (reflecting necessary hardware for new installations and replacement parts).
    *   **2026-2027:** **-20.0%** annual decline.
    *   **2028-2030:** **0.0%** growth (Stabilizes at a low-growth base).

### Revenue Model:

| Year | Units Deployed (UD) | UD Growth | Annual ARPU (USD) | ARPU Growth | SaaS Revenue ($M) | Hardware/Services ($M) | Total Revenue ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (E)** | 772,727 | *Baseline* | $65.94 | *Baseline* | $51.0 | $104.5 | **$155.5** |
| **2025 (P)** | 850,000 | 10.0% | $67.92 | 3.0% | $57.7 | $70.8 | **$128.5** |
| **2026 (P)** | 935,000 | 10.0% | $69.96 | 3.0% | $65.4 | $56.6 | **$122.0** |
| **2027 (P)** | 1,028,500 | 10.0% | $72.06 | 3.0% | $74.1 | $45.3 | **$119.4** |
| **2028 (P)** | 1,100,495 | 7.0% | $74.22 | 3.0% | $81.7 | $45.3 | **$127.0** |
| **2029 (P)** | 1,177,520 | 7.0% | $76.45 | 3.0% | $90.0 | $45.3 | **$135.3** |
| **2030 (P)** | 1,260,946 | 7.0% | $78.74 | 3.0% | $99.3 | $45.3 | **$144.6** |

*Note: 2025 Total Revenue of $128.5M is derived by annualizing the Q2 2025 ARR of $56.9M, adding a 20% growth factor for the rest of the year ($57.7M SaaS), and a conservative projection for the contracting Hardware/Services business ($70.8M).*

## II. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections (2025-2030)

### Margin & Expense Assumptions:

*   **Gross Margin %:** The company is moving to a higher-margin revenue mix.
    *   **SaaS Gross Margin:** Conservative projection of **70.0%** (Actual Q2 2025 was 70.2%).
    *   **Hardware/Services Gross Margin:** Conservative projection of **5.0%** (Actual Q2 2025 hardware GM was very low at $2.3M on $15.1M revenue, or ~15.2%, down from the prior year). The low margin reflects the strategic push to prioritize software attach and de-emphasize bulk hardware sales.
    *   **Blended Gross Margin** will naturally increase as the SaaS component grows.
*   **Operating Expenses (OpEx):** Management is implementing a $30 million annualized cost reduction program. Q2 2025 OpEx was $24.4M/quarter, or ~$97.6M annualized. Applying the cost reduction means a target OpEx of ~$67.6M ($97.6M - $30M). I will project OpEx to flatten then grow slowly as a percentage of Total Revenue.
    *   **OpEx 2025-2027:** $75.0M, reflecting initial savings and continued investment.
    *   **OpEx 2028-2030:** Growing at **3.0%** annually.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Past ROIC is negative (-11.82%). Since the company is projecting a path to profitability and cash flow neutrality, I must assume a positive ROIC for the compounding effect. I will use a conservative ROIC of **6.0%** starting in 2028, the year after projected profitability.

### Projected Net Income:

| Year | Total Revenue ($M) | Blended GM % | Gross Profit ($M) | OpEx ($M) | OpEx Growth | PBT / Net Income from Operations ($M) | ROIC Income ($M) | Total Net Income ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (P)** | $128.5 | 39.8% | $51.2 | $75.0 | *Cost Savings* | $(23.8)$ | $0.0 | $(23.8)$ |
| **2026 (P)** | $122.0 | 44.4% | $54.2 | $75.0 | 0.0% | $(20.8)$ | $0.0 | $(20.8)$ |
| **2027 (P)** | $119.4 | 49.6% | $59.2 | $75.0 | 0.0% | $(15.8)$ | $0.0 | $(15.8)$ |
| **2028 (P)** | $127.0 | 52.6% | $66.8 | $77.3 | 3.0% | $(10.5)$ | $0.0 | $(10.5)$ |
| **2029 (P)** | $135.3 | 54.3% | $73.5 | $79.6 | 3.0% | $(6.1)$ | $0.0 | $(6.1)$ |
| **2030 (P)** | $144.6 | 55.7% | $80.5 | $82.0 | 3.0% | $(1.5)$ | $0.0$ | $(1.5)$ |

*Note: Even with a conservative model for high SaaS margins and cost savings, the company does not achieve GAAP profitability by 2030 based on this OpEx model. However, management is guiding toward **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Cash Flow Neutrality** by end of 2025. For the DCF model, which uses Net Income (a proxy for Free Cash Flow in this case, as per instructions), I must project a positive cash flow for the terminal value.*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

Since the projected Net Income remains negative through 2030, a direct DCF calculation for the explicit period (2025-2030) will result in a negative NPV. This highlights the high-risk, long-term nature of this investment, where the value is almost entirely in the terminal period.

To proceed with a rational DCF, I will follow the core assumptions and:
1.  Use the negative cash flows for the explicit period.
2.  Project a stable **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** for the Terminal Value based on the 2030 Revenue and an assumption of a **3.5%** Net Income Margin, starting in 2031, reflecting ultimate, modest profitability as an established niche technology company.

### DCF Assumptions:

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **12.0%** (Reflects the high volatility, negative historical ROIC, and turnaround risk of the company).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** **3.0%** (Stable long-term growth rate, just above inflation).
*   **Perpetuity FCF Margin:** **3.5%** of 2031 Revenue.

### DCF Calculation:

| Year (t) | Total Net Income ($M) (FCF Proxy) | Discount Factor @ 12.0% | Net Present Value (NPV) ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $(23.8)$ | 0.893 | $(21.2)$ |
| **2026** | $(20.8)$ | 0.797 | $(16.6)$ |
| **2027** | $(15.8)$ | 0.712 | $(11.2)$ |
| **2028** | $(10.5)$ | 0.636 | $(6.7)$ |
| **2029** | $(6.1)$ | 0.567 | $(3.5)$ |
| **2030** | $(1.5)$ | 0.507 | $(0.8)$ |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2025-2030)** | | | **$(60.0)$** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (Starting 2031):

*   **2031 Revenue (3% growth from 2030):** $144.6M * 1.03 = \$149.0M$
*   **Terminal Free Cash Flow (3.5% Margin):** $149.0M * 0.035 = \$5.22M$
*   **Terminal Value Formula:** FCF(t+1) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** $5.22M / (0.12 - 0.03) = \$58.0M$
*   **Terminal Value (NPV Today):** Terminal Value (2030) * Discount Factor (2030)
*   **Terminal Value NPV:** $58.0M * 0.507 = **\$29.4M**

### Total Equity Value:

| Component | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Explicit Cash Flows (2025-2030) | $(60.0)$ |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $29.4$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | **$(30.6)$** |
| Plus: Net Cash / (Debt) (Q2 2025) | $98.58$ |
| **TOTAL FAIR EQUITY VALUE** | **$67.98$** |

## IV. Fair Value and Market Assumption Analysis

### Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Fair Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$67.98 \text{ million}}{188.07 \text{ million}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \mathbf{\$0.36}$$

---

## Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value per Share of $0.36** is significantly lower than the **Current Stock Price of $1.49**.

The main reason for this large discrepancy is that the market is making a far more optimistic assumption about the company's ability to achieve profitability and growth than my conservative model:

1.  **Market's Revenue Assumption (Faster SaaS Pivot):** My model assumes a steep decline in overall revenue (Hardware/Services is dragging down the total) and a conservative 10% UD/3% ARPU growth for the SaaS business.
    *   **Market Implies:** The market believes SMRT will achieve a much **faster and more successful pivot to SaaS**, where the recurring revenue growth **more than offsets** the decline in hardware much sooner. It implies a higher UD growth rate (perhaps 15-20%) and/or a much faster OpEx reduction that drives profitability earlier.
2.  **Market's Profitability Assumption (Lower OpEx and Higher Margin):** My model's conservative OpEx and conservative FCF margin assumption of 3.5% in the terminal period result in a large negative NPV from operations.
    *   **Market Implies:** The market is likely pricing in that the full $30 million in annualized cost savings will be realized and sustained, leading to non-GAAP profitability translating into a **positive GAAP Net Income (and FCF) by 2026 or 2027**, far earlier than my conservative 2030 projection. It is likely using a significantly **higher Terminal FCF Margin** (e.g., 8-10%) typical of mature, successful SaaS companies, which would drastically increase the Terminal Value.
3.  **Market's Discount Rate (Lower Risk):** My high discount rate of 12% reflects significant execution risk.
    *   **Market Implies:** The market is likely using a **lower discount rate** (e.g., 9-10%), reflecting a belief that the company's strong balance sheet (Net Cash of $98.58M) and existing ARR provide a sufficient safety net and lower the overall risk profile of the turnaround.

**In summary, my valuation is low because I strictly adhered to conservative estimates:** the company's high risk profile (12% discount rate), the continued contraction of the total top-line revenue, and the high-but-not-yet-profitable operating cost structure. The market's valuation of SMRT at $1.49 is a bet that the company successfully executes its strategic shift to a high-margin, high-growth SaaS platform and reaches meaningful profitability *well before* 2030.
