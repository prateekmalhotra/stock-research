## Business Summary

Sleep Number Corporation sells adjustable, personalized air mattresses, known as smart beds, primarily to individuals and families across the United States. These customers are typically consumers with disposable income willing to invest more in high-technology bedding. The company operates on a Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) model, meaning they mostly sell their products through their own network of branded retail stores and their e-commerce website, bypassing third-party retailers. This approach gives them complete control over pricing and the customer experience. Revenue is generated overwhelmingly from the sale of these higher-priced smart beds, along with related bedding accessories, making their success dependent on effective marketing of the technology and strong consumer confidence.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for Sleep Number is the sensitivity of its products to overall economic health. Because its smart beds are considered high-cost, non-essential purchases, consumers quickly postpone buying them during periods of economic uncertainty, high inflation, or rising interest rates. This dependence on consumer discretionary spending has historically caused immediate drops in sales and earnings whenever the economy slows down, posing a constant threat to inventory and cash flow. Long-term risks include intense competition from both traditional mattress companies and disruptive 'bed-in-a-box' companies that offer lower prices and simple delivery. Sleep Number requires significant ongoing investment in technology research and marketing to justify its premium price point. If the company fails to maintain a perceived technological advantage, or if high marketing and physical store operating costs erode profit margins, its market position could significantly weaken. Furthermore, reliance on offering consumer financing to facilitate purchases increases the company's exposure to credit risk if a large number of customers fail to make payments.

### **A History of Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR)**

#### **The Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **The Original Vision (1987):** The company was founded in New Hope, Minnesota, by a couple named Bob and JoAnn Walker, initially under the name **Select Comfort Corporation**.
2.  **The Core Problem and Solution:** The business was founded on the belief that a traditional, spring-based mattress is a "one-size-fits-all" solution that doesn't work for everyone. The founders wanted to offer a bed that could be personally adjusted.
3.  **The First Innovation (1991):** They introduced the original Select Comfort bed, which replaced steel springs with adjustable air chambers. This allowed each person to set a personalized firmness level, known as their "Sleep Number."
4.  **Long-Term Goal (Mission):** The company’s mission is to improve people's lives by providing an individualized sleep experience, positioning itself as a "sleep solutions provider" rather than just a mattress maker.

#### **Early Challenges and Pivotal Turnaround**

5.  **Initial Financial Headwinds (1987–1991):** The company struggled at first, with annual sales remaining very low and financial losses accumulating in the first few years.
6.  **The 2001 Crisis and Economic Headwind:** Around the early 2000s, coinciding with a weak economy and falling consumer confidence (the dot-com bust era), Select Comfort faced a critical period of "weakening performance trends."
7.  **Innovative Solution (The Turnaround Strategy):** Management responded by taking drastic steps: they cut nearly **$26 million** in costs, improved product quality, and significantly expanded distribution into new channels like the QVC television shopping channel.
8.  **The Key Marketing Tactic:** They launched a highly successful advertising campaign featuring the memorable slogan: **"Everybody has a SLEEP NUMBER® What's yours?"** This immediately boosted brand awareness and increased store traffic, helping them achieve profitability by the end of 2001.

#### **The Digital Age and Modern Innovation**

9.  **The Move to Smart Technology (2013):** The next major innovation was the introduction of **SleepIQ Technology**. This system embedded sensors into the mattress to track a person's movement, breathing, and heart rate during the night.
10. **The Smart Bed Revolution (2017):** Building on this data platform, the company launched the **360® smart bed**, which automatically adjusts the bed's firmness and support based on the sleeper's movements. This positioned the bed as a high-tech wellness product.
11. **The Brand Shift (2017):** To clearly signal this focus on technology and personalized health, the company officially changed its corporate name from Select Comfort Corporation to **Sleep Number Corporation**.
12. **Data as a Tailwind:** Sleep Number has collected over **32 billion hours** of anonymized sleep data, which is a powerful advantage and a key "tailwind" that they use to continuously improve their products and offer personalized sleep recommendations.

#### **Contemporary Headwinds and Current Strategy**

13. **Competition Headwind (The Bed-in-a-Box Era):** The rise of Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brands like Casper and Purple posed a significant challenge. These companies offer quality mattresses online at lower price points and simplified the buying process.
14. **The Response to Competition:** Sleep Number leveraged its main strength—its extensive retail store network—to offer an in-person, immersive experience where customers could interact with the technology and find their precise Sleep Number, a feature online competitors cannot easily replicate.
15. **Economic Headwinds (Recent Years):** More recently (2023–2024), the company has faced significant challenges, including a decline in sales and increased debt, in part because its high-priced beds are considered a discretionary luxury purchase that consumers often delay during economic uncertainty.
16. **The Current Turnaround Plan:** A new CEO was appointed in 2025 with a focus on a turnaround strategy that emphasizes becoming a leaner organization through cost-cutting, supply chain improvements, and simplifying its product offerings.
17. **Future Tailwinds and Goal:** The biggest long-term tailwind is the growing consumer interest in overall health and wellness. Sleep Number aims to capitalize on this by positioning its smart bed as a central part of a healthy lifestyle, driving its vision to be a beloved brand that delivers an unparalleled sleep experience.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR) is primarily built on its proprietary technology, vast data set, and unique distribution model, which together transform the company from a simple mattress retailer into a wellness technology firm.

Here is an analysis of its competitive advantages (moat) in simple terms:

### The Moat and Differentiation (What makes it different)

1.  **Proprietary Sleep Technology:** The core product, the 360 smart bed with SleepIQ technology, is a health and wellness device, not just a bed. It measures heart rate, breathing, and movement, and then automatically adjusts the firmness and support for each sleeper.
2.  **Unique Data Advantage (Longitudinal Data):** Sleep Number has collected and analyzed billions of hours of sleep data from its customers over time. This massive, real-world data set is used to continually improve its algorithms, develop new features, and provide highly personalized insights and recommendations to users, which a competitor cannot easily replicate.
3.  **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Vertical Model:** The company sells its products through its own exclusive retail stores and online channels, rather than through third-party retailers. This allows them to control the entire customer experience, from manufacturing to sale, which is cited as a strategic advantage.
4.  **"Individualized Sleep" Positioning:** By defining itself as a wellness technology company, Sleep Number differentiates itself from traditional, commodity mattress companies, allowing it to charge a premium for a product that promises tangible health benefits like improved sleep quality.

### Pricing Power and Special Market Position

1.  **Premium Pricing Power:** The advanced, proprietary technology and the promise of personalized health benefits enable Sleep Number to justify a high, premium price point for its smart beds compared to standard luxury mattresses.
2.  **Special Niche:** Sleep Number occupies a unique market position at the intersection of well-being, technology, and home goods. They compete less on foam or springs and more on data, personalized comfort, and health, carving out a specialized, high-value segment.

### Reason for Growth and Resilience to Competition

1.  **Focus on Innovation and Wellness:** The company's growth was fueled by a strategic shift to continually invest in its smart bed technology, capitalizing on the consumer trend toward prioritizing health and wellness.
2.  **Brand Loyalty and Advocacy:** The loyal community of "Smart Sleepers" acts as a powerful marketing engine, with brand loyalty and referrals representing a significant portion (around 50%) of its business, which is a highly efficient source of new customers.
3.  **Difficulty for Capital-Rich Competitors:** While a competitor with more capital can enter the market, they would still need to develop comparable proprietary sensor technology, build a massive dataset for personalized recommendations, and replicate the vertically integrated distribution network, making immediate displacement difficult.

### Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

1.  **Sticky Customer Relationships:** Although the purchase of the bed is a one-time event, the relationship is described as "lifelong." The daily SleepIQ data and customized tips create a continuous, valuable engagement that makes the customer sticky and less likely to switch brands when it's time to replace their bed.
2.  **Customer Ecosystem Lock-in:** The customer's accumulated sleep data and their reliance on the personalized SleepIQ score to manage their sleep health act as an "ecosystem lock-in," making it costly (in terms of lost data and personalized insight) to switch to a non-Sleep Number product.
3.  **Potential for Recurring Revenue:** The company has opportunities to develop future subscription-based services by offering more in-depth personalized sleep insights and recommendations based on the collected data, which could transform the business model to include true recurring revenue.

### Investment in R&D and Innovation

1.  **Significant Investment in R&D:** Sleep Number heavily invests in Research & Development, with expenses cited as growing from $35 million in 2019 to $59 million in 2021, showing a clear commitment to technological advancement.
2.  **Constant Need for Innovation:** To maintain its premium positioning and competitive edge, the company must constantly innovate, using its vast data to improve its software and hardware and introduce new products, such as its Climate360 smart bed. The smart bed market requires continuous technological updates to stay relevant.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR) are primarily centered around its ongoing business turnaround strategy, which focuses on aggressive cost management and a planned return to top-line growth.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Exceeding Cost Reduction Targets:** The company expects to exceed its operating expense reduction target of approximately **$130 million** for 2025, which, as management stated, is a key element of the turnaround to improve profitability despite lower sales.
2.  **Marketing Efficiency and Increased Spend:** Management is confident that a revised marketing strategy, which has already led to improvements in cost per acquisition, will drive more traffic to stores and online in the upcoming quarter.
3.  **Gross Margin Improvement:** The gross profit margin has remained strong (near 60%) due to cost-of-goods-sold reductions and favorable product mix, which helps protect profits while the company works to restore sales volume.
4.  **Financial Flexibility:** The company successfully amended and extended its bank agreement through 2027, which provides necessary financial flexibility and lessens immediate debt concerns as they execute the turnaround.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **2026 Product Refresh for Wider Appeal:** Management explicitly mentioned a product lineup refresh planned for early 2026, which is intended to target a broader audience and is seen as a major move to stabilize and then grow the top-line.
2.  **Return to Top-Line Growth:** The core long-term goal, as stated by management, is to stabilize net sales in 2026, which is expected to lead to meaningful growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in the future.
3.  **Free Cash Flow Generation and Debt Paydown:** A primary strategic priority is to increase cash generation, with an aim to generate free cash flow and reduce the outstanding credit line balance, which will improve the balance sheet.
4.  **Enhanced Customer Value Proposition:** Continued innovation and the existing proprietary SleepIQ technology, along with high customer satisfaction (winning a recent J.D. Power award for mattresses), supports the brand's unique value proposition for sustained loyalty and growth.
5.  **Optimized Distribution Model:** The company is refining its distribution strategy, including closing underperforming stores while retaining their sales with positive transfer rates to the remaining, highly profitable retail footprint.

## Management Record

Based on an analysis of public and investor relations information, here is an overview of Sleep Number Corporation's (SNBR) management, relevant to an investor:

### **Recent Management Transition and Current Leadership**

1.  **Current CEO Background:** Linda Findley joined as President and CEO on April 7, 2025. She is an accomplished senior executive with expertise in digital and physical consumer brands, previously serving as CEO of Blue Apron Holdings and Chief Operating Officer at Etsy, Inc.
2.  **Management Tenure & Team Structure:** The current management team is considered new and has a short average tenure (less than a year), reflecting the recent organizational overhaul. Key roles were restructured as part of the new CEO’s organizational redesign.
3.  **CEO's Immediate Action & Key Decisions:** Within weeks of taking the helm, CEO Findley announced steep operational changes, including an organizational redesign, cutting 21% of corporate management positions, and a plan for \$80 million to \$100 million in annualized cost reductions.
4.  **Current Focus and Performance:** The immediate focus is a "full turnaround" to create a "stable business" and position for future growth. This plan was implemented to address significant financial challenges, including a recent widening net loss and declining net sales (down 19.6% in Q3 2025 year-over-year).

### **Previous Management: Shelly R. Ibach (2012–2025)**

5.  **Track Record of Transformation:** Previous CEO Shelly R. Ibach, who served from 2012 to early 2025, is credited with transforming the company from a specialty mattress retailer (Select Comfort) into a purpose-driven, sleep tech wellness brand.
6.  **Key Strategic Decisions (Previous):** Under Ibach's leadership, the company introduced the $360^{\text{®}}$ smart bed and grew revenue from \$743 million to \$1.9 billion in 2023, while sustaining a period of "superior stakeholder value creation."

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of Sleep Number Corporation's (SNBR) most recent public filings, including the 2024 and 2025 proxy statements (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure appear to be designed with significant mechanisms to align executive interests with those of the shareholders.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is a substantial **19.65%** of the company's stock, which is a high percentage. This significant personal investment by managers and directors directly links their personal financial returns to the company's stock price performance, strongly suggesting an alignment with shareholder interests.

2.  **Robust Stock Ownership Guidelines:** The Board has established mandatory **Share Ownership Guidelines** for executive officers and directors. These guidelines require executives and directors to hold a certain value of the company's stock, further locking their wealth into the long-term performance of the shares.

3.  **Emphasis on "At-Risk" Pay:** The executive compensation program is heavily skewed toward **variable, "at-risk" compensation** that is incentive-based. This structure ensures that a majority of an executive's potential total compensation is earned only if predetermined performance targets are achieved.

4.  **Performance-Based Long-Term Equity (PSUs):** Long-Term Incentives (LTI) include **Performance Share Units (PSUs)** with a typical three-year performance cycle. These awards are designed to encourage the creation of long-term shareholder value and are subject to the achievement of specific long-term financial objectives.

5.  **Focus on Key Financial Metrics:** The company's strategy and implicit incentive metrics focus on strong financial management, including generating **strong free cash flow to pay down debt**. The use of financial metrics tied to cash generation is generally seen as a healthy measure for creating shareholder value, as it drives liquidity and financial stability.

6.  **Retention Component (RSUs):** The LTI program also includes **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** that vest over a three-year period, primarily serving as a mechanism to retain key management personnel. While RSUs are not purely performance-based like PSUs, the three-year vesting schedule ties the value realized directly to the sustained stock price over that period.

7.  **Shareholder Approval:** Shareholders have shown strong support for the executive compensation plan, with the **Say-on-Pay proposal** receiving over 96% of votes in favor at the 2024 annual meeting (for 2023 compensation). This indicates that the compensation structure is generally well-received and approved by the shareholder base.

### **Conclusion**

**Sleep Number Corporation's management is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

*   The combination of a high **insider ownership percentage** and mandatory **stock ownership guidelines** creates a direct, long-term personal financial alignment between management and shareholders.
*   The pay mix, which is heavily weighted toward "at-risk" pay through **PSUs and RSUs**, ensures that management's greatest rewards come from meeting multi-year financial goals and sustained stock price appreciation, rather than short-term gains.
*   The focus on metrics like **free cash flow and debt reduction** encourages responsible financial stewardship, which benefits the long-term value of the company and its shares.

## Price History

### Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR) Price History and Technical Analysis

1.  **Current Price Relative to 52-Week Range:** The stock is trading significantly closer to its 52-week low than its high, reflecting a major decline in value over the past year. The 52-week range is between a low of **\$3.49** and a high of **\$20.73**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Based on a recent closing price of approximately \$3.92, Sleep Number Corporation's stock is currently trading about **12.32%** above its 52-week low of \$3.49.

3.  **Technical Analysis: Is it Trading Low?** Short-term technical indicators suggest the stock is trading at a low price point and is considered **oversold**. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been recently reported below 30, which is typically an oversold signal that can suggest a potential reversal.

4.  **Overall Technical Trend:** Despite the oversold signal, the longer-term technical outlook is generally **bearish** or a "Strong Sell," as indicated by multiple moving averages. The 50-day moving average is below the 200-day moving average, confirming a dominant downward long-term trend.

5.  **Big Drop Explanation (Last Few Months):** The stock experienced a major drop, falling nearly **19%** in a single period following the report of disappointing third-quarter 2025 financial results. The shares are also down approximately **74.2%** since the beginning of the year, reflecting a long-term decline.

6.  **Reasons for the Decline:** The company reported a significant drop in net sales (nearly 20% year-over-year) and a much larger loss per share than analysts expected, which led to the stock plunge. This performance was attributed to a confluence of factors, including ongoing softness in the U.S. bedding industry, weaker shopper demand, and a reduction in its store count.

## Long Thesis

Sleep Number is currently priced like a failing traditional mattress company, but the bull case argues that its aggressive financial turnaround and unique technology moat will drive a significant recovery. In the near term, a new management team is focused on steep cost-cutting (over $100 million) and operational efficiency to stabilize the business, generate free cash flow, and reduce debt. This stabilization effort aims to survive the current economic downturn. In the long term, the company will capitalize on its proprietary SleepIQ technology, which uses billions of hours of customer data to position the bed as a premium, high-tech health and wellness device, not just furniture. This data-driven advantage, combined with high customer loyalty and a planned major product refresh in 2026, will allow Sleep Number to reignite sales growth, restore profit margins, and justify its high valuation as a specialized technology firm.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the new CEO and management team will successfully execute the financial turnaround plan, achieving targeted cost savings and generating significant free cash flow to pay down debt. It also assumes that consumer discretionary spending recovers sufficiently by late 2025 or 2026, allowing customers to resume purchasing expensive, high-end items. Crucially, the company must maintain its technological lead over competitors, ensuring that the proprietary SleepIQ data and features continue to justify the premium price point and that the planned 2026 product refresh successfully captures a broader market.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the following holes and faults in the long thesis for Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR).

### **Critique and Faults in the Bull Case Thesis**

#### **I. Flaws in the Financial Turnaround and Stabilization Assumption**

1.  **Top-Line Erosion Outpaces Cost Savings:** The thesis overstates the impact of cost-cutting. While the new management has increased its targeted cost reductions to over $130 million annually, net sales have declined for 11 consecutive quarters, including a nearly 20% year-over-year drop in Q3 2025. This steep top-line decline outweighs operational efficiencies and leads to significant net losses.
2.  **Imminent Debt Risk, Not Debt Reduction:** The assumption of generating *significant free cash flow to pay down debt* is flawed. The company's immediate focus is survival, evidenced by an amended bank agreement and a trailing 12-month leverage ratio (5.0x EBITDAR) sitting uncomfortably close to its amended debt covenant maximum (5.25x). This severe debt pressure indicates that cash flow will be prioritized for covenant compliance and short-term liquidity, not strategic long-term deleveraging.
3.  **Cost Cuts Compromise Future Growth:** The required *aggressive* cost-cutting has included a reduction in R&D expenses and the elimination of the Chief Innovation Officer role. Slashing core innovation and marketing budgets to achieve short-term free cash flow directly undermines the long-term thesis that the company will re-ignite growth and restore margins via a technological lead.

#### **II. Flaws in the Unique Technology Moat Assumption**

4.  **Technology Moat is Narrowing and Competitors Offer Superior Features:** The "unique technology moat" of SleepIQ is being eroded. Competitors like Eight Sleep excel in the critical feature of *active temperature regulation* (offering a wider range than SNBR's Climate360 model) and provide a more modular and often cheaper solution (smart cover for an existing mattress) to gain health data and adjust temperature.
5.  **High Price Point vs. Competition:** Sleep Number's beds, particularly its high-end Climate360 model, can run significantly higher in price (MSRP over $10,000 for some versions) compared to key competitors offering similar, or in some areas superior, *smart* features. This premium price makes the product highly vulnerable to consumer trade-downs during an economic slowdown.
6.  **Dependence on a Single, High-Risk Catalyst:** The entire long-term recovery hinges on the successful launch of a major product refresh in 2026. This "all-or-nothing" strategy is high-risk, especially with reduced R&D and marketing capacity. If the launch is delayed, or fails to be a major technological leap beyond competitors, the company risks further losses and a default.

#### **III. Flaws in the Market Recovery Assumption**

7.  **Luxury Market Recovery May Be Too Slow and Weak:** The thesis relies on a strong recovery in consumer discretionary spending by late 2025/2026. However, reports indicate the luxury furniture and home furnishings sector is underperforming and remains highly sensitive to recessionary pressures and economic instability. Furthermore, U.S. smart mattress market growth is projected to be lower than the global average and show an "observable plateau" among early adopters between 2025 and 2027, suggesting the recovery in SNBR's specific high-end niche may be slower than anticipated.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR)**

Sleep Number is a financially distressed retailer with an unsustainable debt load, operating in a discretionary market that is in decline, and its core technological advantage is rapidly being commoditized.

**The Bear Case argues that the turnaround is a race against time that the company will lose due to:**

1.  **Imminent Liquidity and Debt Risk:** The company's sales decline (11 consecutive down quarters) and continuous net losses are structurally outpacing its cost-cutting efforts. The razor-thin cushion against its amended debt covenants signals that a sustained economic dip could trigger a covenant breach and a severe liquidity event, leading to a highly dilutive capital raise or bankruptcy restructuring.
2.  **Decay of the Technology Moat:** Competitors like Eight Sleep are segmenting the "smart bed" market, offering superior temperature technology and a lower-cost, modular product (a smart cover that works with any mattress) that disrupts Sleep Number's vertically integrated and high-priced model. Sleep Number's self-inflicted cuts to R&D and marketing to conserve cash will ensure this competitive gap widens, preventing the company from justifying its premium price or capturing new customers.
3.  **Cyclical Demand Headwinds:** The "premium mattress" product is a high-ticket, highly postponable luxury item. The bet on a 2026 consumer spending rebound is uncertain, and current macroeconomic headwinds suggest sustained weakness in discretionary spending, dooming the company's planned 2026 product refresh—its single path to sales growth—before it even launches.

## Next Steps

The analysis is very robust, clearly defining the core conflict between the aggressive turnaround plan (bull case) and the imminent debt risk/sales decline (bear case).

To bridge the gap and determine if the current low price presents an opportunity or a value trap, the next steps should focus on quantifying the financial risk and validating the long-term technological advantage.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered for further investigation:

### Next Steps to Investigate

1.  **Immediate Financial Health and Debt Risk Quantification**
    *   **Covenant Breach Risk:** Investigate the precise terms of the company's amended debt covenants (specifically the leverage ratio limit of 5.25x EBITDAR) and the reported current ratio (5.0x). Determine the estimated sales/EBITDA drop that would push the company into a **covenant breach** in 2026.
    *   **Liquidity and Debt Maturity:** Detail the exact current cash position and the scheduled debt maturity dates over the next 3-5 years. This is essential for assessing the company's ability to survive the current sales slump without a highly dilutive capital raise.

2.  **Validation of the Technology Moat vs. Key Competitors**
    *   **Eight Sleep Deep Dive:** Conduct a direct feature, price, and customer review comparison between Sleep Number's premium Climate360 bed (and its data platform) and the best smart bed/cover offerings from competitors like **Eight Sleep**.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction in the Smart Niche:** Research which brand (SNBR or its smart competitors) holds the superior position in areas the bull case hinges on: *temperature regulation*, *sleep data accuracy*, and *app user experience*, as poor performance here invalidates the premium price point.

3.  **Working Capital and Inventory Management**
    *   **Inventory Health:** Analyze the inventory turnover ratio and the absolute inventory level from the most recent 10-Q filing. High, increasing inventory in a period of declining sales suggests future risk of significant **markdowns** or **write-downs**, which would hurt gross margin despite cost-of-goods-sold reductions.
    *   **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Examine the company's Cash Conversion Cycle (Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payables Outstanding) to understand how efficiently management is turning working capital into cash, especially given the cost-cutting mandate.

4.  **Quantifying Market Expectations and Valuation**
    *   **Implied Growth Rate:** Based on the current enterprise value and conservative estimates for the cost structure, calculate the **implied stabilized net sales** needed to justify the current stock price. This will show what level of turnaround the market is *already* pricing in.
    *   **Analyst Consensus on 2026:** Find the current average analyst estimates for 2026 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This provides a clear benchmark to judge whether the management's turnaround plan aligns with Wall Street's expectations for stabilization.

5.  **Details of the 2026 Product Refresh (The Major Catalyst)**
    *   **Innovation Strategy:** Search for recent investor day presentations or earnings call transcripts where management provides any specific details on the **major product refresh planned for early 2026**. What specific technological leaps or price point adjustments are expected to broaden its market appeal, as this is the primary long-term growth driver?
