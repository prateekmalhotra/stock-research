## 2. Business Engine Analysis and Assumptions

L.B. Foster's strategic direction, as guided by management, is a "strategic transformation" from a diversified infrastructure supplier to a "technology focused, high-growth solutions provider" aimed at improving profitability and free cash flow. This is executed through divestitures of low-margin/volatile businesses (e.g., UK automation and Bridge Grid Deck) and a focus on higher-margin growth platforms.

The primary growth drivers are:
1.  **Infrastructure Solutions Growth:** Driven by a robust Precast Concrete business (up 36.0% in Q2 2025) and Protective Coatings. The new Central Florida precast concrete facility is a specific, capital-light driver for future growth.
2.  **Rail Technology Growth:** Driven by high-margin solutions like Global Friction Management (up 22.1% in Q2 2025) and Total Track Monitoring.
3.  **Infrastructure Investment Super Cycle:** The company is positioning itself to benefit from significant infrastructure spending in North America, where 95% of its sales occur.

### Revenue Projections

The valuation will use management's 2025 net sales guidance as a baseline and then apply a conservative, declining growth rate, reflecting both organic growth and the challenges (e.g., delayed federal project funding in rail) and opportunities (e.g., high-growth product lines) outlined by management.

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Actual) | \$530.8 | Full Year Actual |
| **2025** (Base) | \$545.0 | Midpoint of revised 2025 Guidance (\$535M - \$555M). This represents 2.7% growth over 2024, in line with management's organic sales growth forecast. |
| **2026** | \$572.3 | **5.0% Growth:** Higher growth rate reflecting the full-year impact of high-growth segments (Precast, Friction Management) and initial realization of infrastructure project demand, partially offset by global economic uncertainty. |
| **2027** | \$595.2 | **4.0% Growth:** Continued strong, but decelerating, growth as the high-margin platforms mature and cyclicality of rail and construction moderates. |
| **2028** | \$619.0 | **4.0% Growth:** Assumes continued benefit from North American infrastructure cycle. |
| **2029** | \$643.8 | **4.0% Growth:** Sustainable growth rate above historical GDP, reflecting the successful business transformation and focus on technology-driven solutions. |
| **2030** | \$669.5 | **4.0% Growth:** Final year of explicit forecast before terminal value. |

### Margin Projections

The company is successfully improving its margin profile by shedding low-margin businesses and focusing on higher-value products. Full-year 2024 Gross Margin was 22.2%, and Q3 2024 Gross Margin hit a decade high of 23.8%. The Q2 2025 Gross Margin was 21.5%, which is a conservative baseline.

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin %** | 22.5% | 23.0% | 23.5% | 23.5% | 24.0% | 24.0% | Conservative, gradual increase from the Q2 2025 base of 21.5% toward the Q3 2024 peak of 23.8%, reflecting the mix shift to high-margin products and cost reductions. |
| **Net Income Margin %** | 3.0% | 3.5% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.5% | 4.5% | The company is projected to be profitable, despite Q2 2025 net income being flat. Management is guiding for significant Adjusted EBITDA growth (midpoint \$42M for 2025). The base 3.0% margin for 2025 is conservative, building toward a mid-single-digit margin as operational efficiencies from the strategic plan are fully realized. |

## 3. Projected Cash Flow and Net Present Value (NPV)

The DCF valuation uses Net Income as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) to Equity, as per the rules, with an adjustment for incremental return on capital.

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption

L.B. Foster has had volatile and sometimes negative historical ROIC due to the business transformation and asset writedowns. Since future operations are projected to be profitable, a conservative but positive long-term ROIC is assumed for the reinvested Net Income.

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **2.0%**

### Net Income Projection and Cash Flow

| Year | Revenue | Gross Margin % | Gross Profit | Net Income Margin % | Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$545.0 | 22.5% | \$122.6 | 3.0% | \$16.4 | \$0.0 | \$16.4 |
| **2026** | \$572.3 | 23.0% | \$131.6 | 3.5% | \$20.0 | (\$16.4 * 2.0%) = \$0.3 | \$20.3 |
| **2027** | \$595.2 | 23.5% | \$139.9 | 4.0% | \$23.8 | ((\$16.4 + \$20.0) * 2.0%) = \$0.7 | \$24.5 |
| **2028** | \$619.0 | 23.5% | \$145.5 | 4.0% | \$24.8 | ((\$16.4 + \$20.0 + \$23.8) * 2.0%) = \$1.2 | \$26.0 |
| **2029** | \$643.8 | 24.0% | \$154.5 | 4.5% | \$29.0 | ((\$16.4 + \$20.0 + \$23.8 + \$24.8) * 2.0%) = \$1.7 | \$30.7 |
| **2030** | \$669.5 | 24.0% | \$160.7 | 4.5% | \$30.1 | ((\$16.4 + \$20.0 + \$23.8 + \$24.8 + \$29.0) * 2.0%) = \$2.3 | \$32.4 |

*Note: For 2025 Net Income calculation, 2025 Revenue is used. Net Income is calculated as a portion of Revenue, not Gross Profit.*

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** **12.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative rate for a small-cap industrial company undergoing a significant turnaround, reflecting a higher risk profile than a large, established entity.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** **2.5%**
    *   *Justification:* A modest growth rate for a mature infrastructure/rail company, slightly above long-term expected inflation/global GDP, reflecting the successful shift to higher-growth, technology-focused niches.

| Year | Total Cash Flow | Discount Factor (12.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$16.4 | 0.8929 | \$14.6 |
| **2026** | \$20.3 | 0.7972 | \$16.2 |
| **2027** | \$24.5 | 0.7121 | \$17.4 |
| **2028** | \$26.0 | 0.6355 | \$16.5 |
| **2029** | \$30.7 | 0.5674 | \$17.4 |
| **2030** | \$32.4 | 0.5066 | \$16.4 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2025-2030)** | | | **\$98.5** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030)

*   Terminal Value (TV) = [2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = [\$32.4 * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.120 - 0.025)
*   TV = \$33.2 / 0.095 = **\$349.5 million**

### Net Present Value of Terminal Value

*   NPV of TV = Terminal Value * 2030 Discount Factor
*   NPV of TV = \$349.5 million * 0.5066 = **\$177.1 million**

### Total Equity Value

*   Total Equity Value = NPV of Explicit Period + NPV of Terminal Value
*   Total Equity Value = \$98.5 million + \$177.1 million = **\$275.6 million**

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value** | \$275.6 |
| **Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$4.2 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$81.6 |
| **Calculated Market Value of Equity** | **\$198.2** |
| **Shares Outstanding** (Millions) | 10.60 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$18.70** |

---

## Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value per Share is \$18.70**.

The market's current stock price (as of Oct 24, 2025) is **\$27.26**.

The fair value is **31.4% lower** than the current market price, indicating that the market is making more aggressive assumptions about the company's future performance than this conservative DCF model.

### Justification for the Difference

The primary difference stems from the conservative nature of the assumptions used in this DCF model compared to what the market is likely pricing in:

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Growth and Margin Expansion:** The market is likely valuing the stock based on a faster and more complete realization of the "technology focused" strategic transformation.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market is implicitly assuming a long-term **Net Income Margin of 6.0% to 7.0%** and a **long-term growth rate (Maturity Rate) of 3.0% to 3.5%**, or a lower discount rate for a company that has successfully navigated a turnaround.
    *   **Model Assumption:** The model used a highly conservative peak Net Income Margin of **4.5%** and a long-term maturity rate of **2.5%** to adhere to the rule of using conservative estimates. The model's conservatism on margins, despite management successfully implementing divestitures of low-margin lines, is the largest contributing factor to the lower valuation.

2.  **Market is Pricing in Infrastructure Super Cycle:** The market has a more optimistic view of the *timing and magnitude* of the North American infrastructure investment, particularly the recovery in the Rail segment that has been facing headwinds from delayed federal project funding. The market believes the strong backlog growth (up 8.1% in Q2 2025) will translate to significantly higher revenue growth (e.g., 6%-8% YoY) in 2026-2030 than the model's 4.0% plateau.

3.  **Conservative ROIC/Net Income to FCF Conversion:** The rule-mandated addition of a mere 2.0% ROIC on retained earnings is highly conservative, as FCF for a mature industrial company can often be higher than Net Income due to non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization. Management's guidance of \$15M - \$25M FCF for 2025 is higher than the model's calculated 2025 Net Income of \$16.4M, further suggesting the model's FCF proxy is on the low end.

In summary, the market is pricing in the potential for **high-growth and successful margin expansion** from the business transformation, while this valuation model maintains a **conservative approach to both growth and profitability margins**, leading to a lower fair value estimate.
