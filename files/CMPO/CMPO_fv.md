## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

CompoSecure's core business engine is driven by:
1.  **Premium Metal Card Adoption:** The secular shift of credit card issuers (traditional banks and FinTechs) from plastic to premium metal cards to enhance brand and customer retention.
2.  **Operational Efficiency (COS):** The "CompoSecure Operating System" (COS) which drives margin expansion through process improvements.
3.  **Arculus Platform Growth:** The expansion of its SaaS-style revenue from the Arculus security and authentication platform.
4.  **Strategic Acquisition:** The announced business combination with Husky Technologies, expected to close in Q1 2026, which is projected to be immediately accretive to earnings.

**Management Guidance (Used as Truth):**
*   **2025 Revenue:** **\$463 million** (Non-GAAP Net Sales)
*   **2026 Revenue:** **\$510 million** (Non-GAAP Net Sales), which represents a **10.2% Y/Y growth** ((\$510M / \$463M) - 1).

**Revenue Engine Assumptions (2027-2030):**

The 10.2% growth from 2025 to 2026 is robust, driven by the core business momentum, new program wins, and the initial impact of the Husky merger. A **conservative approach** dictates a gradual deceleration in the organic growth rate after the immediate impact of the Husky merger and major new card program wins subside.

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions) | Y/Y Growth % | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **\$463.0** | N/A | Management's raised full-year guidance. |
| **2026** | **\$510.0** | 10.2% | Management's initial full-year guidance. |
| **2027** | **\$550.8** | **8.0%** | Conservative drop from 10.2% as new customer programs mature, but still strong growth due to continued metal card adoption and early Arculus scaling. |
| **2028** | **\$588.3** | **6.8%** | Further deceleration toward a sustainable, market-leading growth rate as the metal card market begins to saturate in core geographies. |
| **2029** | **\$622.7** | **6.0%** | Settling into a high single-digit growth rate, primarily driven by international expansion and stable, recurring Arculus platform revenue. |
| **2030** | **\$654.0** | **5.0%** | Conservative mature growth rate, approaching the estimated global payment card market CAGR of 7.5%, but discounted to be cautious. |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

CompoSecure has demonstrated strong margin expansion, with Q3 2025 Non-GAAP Gross Margin at **59.0%** and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin at **39.5%**. This improvement is explicitly attributed to the "CompoSecure Operating System" and operational efficiency.

**Margin Assumptions:**
*   **Gross Margin:** The 59.0% gross margin is a recent high. For conservatism, I will project a slight moderation from this peak, assuming some price pressure or variable cost increases, but maintaining a high level due to the "COS."
*   **Net Income Margin (Pre-ROIC):** I will project Net Income using the Adjusted EBITDA Margin and estimating non-EBITDA costs:
    *   *Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):* Estimated at a conservative **2.0% of revenue**.
    *   *Tax Rate:* A conservative statutory tax rate of **25.0%**.

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (Millions)** | \$463.0 | \$510.0 | \$550.8 | \$588.3 | \$622.7 | \$654.0 |
| **Adj. EBITDA Margin (%)** | 36.3% | 37.3% | **38.0%** | **38.5%** | **39.0%** | **39.0%** |
| **Adj. EBITDA (Millions)** | \$168.0 | \$190.0 | \$209.3 | \$226.5 | \$242.9 | \$255.1 |
| *Less: D&A (2.0% of Rev)* | (\$9.3) | (\$10.2) | (\$11.0) | (\$11.8) | (\$12.5) | (\$13.1) |
| **EBIT (Millions)** | \$158.7 | \$179.8 | \$198.3 | \$214.7 | \$230.4 | \$242.0 |
| *Less: Tax (25.0% of EBIT)* | (\$39.7) | (\$44.9) | (\$49.6) | (\$53.7) | (\$57.6) | (\$60.5) |
| **Projected Net Income (Millions)** | **\$119.0** | **\$134.8** | **\$148.7** | **\$161.0** | **\$172.8** | **\$181.5** |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 25.7% | 26.4% | 27.0% | 27.4% | 27.8% | 27.8% |

*Note on 2025/2026 EBITDA:* The 2025 EBITDA of \$168M is the midpoint of the guidance (\$165M-\$170M). The 2026 EBITDA of \$190M is the management guidance.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Net Income with ROIC (Cash Accumulation)

The rule states: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Given the company's strong margins and high-tech product, a high internal rate of return on retained earnings is reasonable. However, adhering to the *conservative* rule, I will select a modest ROIC of **10.0%**.

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) | Previous Year Acc. Net Income (B) | ROIC Income (B * 10.0%) (C) | Total Cash Flow / Net Income (A + C) (Millions) | NPV Factor (15.0%) | NPV (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$119.0 | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | **\$119.0** | 0.8696 | \$103.5 |
| **2026** | \$134.8 | \$119.0 | \$11.9 | **\$146.7** | 0.7561 | \$110.9 |
| **2027** | \$148.7 | \$265.7 | \$26.6 | **\$175.3** | 0.6575 | \$115.3 |
| **2028** | \$161.0 | \$441.0 | \$44.1 | **\$205.1** | 0.5718 | \$117.3 |
| **2029** | \$172.8 | \$646.1 | \$64.6 | **\$237.4** | 0.4972 | \$118.0 |
| **2030** | \$181.5 | \$883.5 | \$88.4 | **\$269.9** | 0.4323 | \$116.7 |

*   *Note:* The "Previous Year Acc. Net Income (B)" for 2026 is the 2025 Net Income. For 2027, it is (2025 Net Income + 2026 Total Cash Flow), and so on, representing the cash accumulation.

### B. Conservative Discount and Maturity Rates

*   **Discount Rate:** A conservative but reasonable rate is the typical cost of equity for a publicly traded company with a high-growth component, adjusted for risk. Given the recent volatile performance (noted GAAP loss due to non-cash items) and the small-cap status, a high-end rate is justified.
    *   *Assumption:* **15.0%** (Conservative Discount Rate).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Value Growth):** A very conservative rate for long-term growth, well below expected GDP/inflation to be cautious.
    *   *Assumption:* **2.0%** (Very Conservative Maturity Rate).

### C. Terminal Value and Net Present Value (NPV)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model on the 2030 cash flow, assuming it grows at the Maturity Rate (2.0%) forever.

1.  **Terminal Value Calculation:**
    TV = [2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    TV = [\$269.9 Million * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.15 - 0.02)
    TV = \$275.3 Million / 0.13
    **TV = \$2,117.7 Million**

2.  **NPV of Terminal Value:**
    NPV (TV) = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Last Year)
    NPV (TV) = \$2,117.7 Million / (1.15)^6
    NPV (TV) = \$2,117.7 Million * 0.4323
    **NPV (TV) = \$915.0 Million**

3.  **Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
    Total NPV = Sum of NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030) + NPV of Terminal Value
    Total NPV = (\$103.5 + \$110.9 + \$115.3 + \$117.3 + \$118.0 + \$116.7) + \$915.0
    Total NPV = \$681.7 Million + \$915.0 Million
    **Total NPV = \$1,596.7 Million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Calculation of Fair Value

| Metric | Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Future Cash Flows | \$1,596.7 |
| Plus: Current Net Cash (Liquid Assets - Debt) | \$75.3 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$1,672.0** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 124.6 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$13.42** |

### B. Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Price | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$13.42** | **\$21.14** | **-36.5%** |

**Justification for the Difference:**

My calculated conservative fair value of **\$13.42** is significantly *lower* than the current market price of **\$21.14**. The market is making considerably more aggressive assumptions about the company's future.

**The Market's Assumptions vs. My Conservative Assumptions:**

1.  **Husky Technologies Acquisition:** My valuation does not explicitly model the financials of the combined CMPO-Husky entity. The market's higher valuation is likely anticipating the **expected synergies and accretion** from the Husky merger. Management expects the transaction to be "over 20% accretive to adjusted diluted EPS in the first full year" post-closing. The market is likely pricing in a new, higher, and more durable earnings power that the combined entity will generate, along with a lower risk profile due to diversification. My model, which only uses the pre-merger CMPO's operating guidance and a conservative growth rate, is missing this massive, transformative step.

2.  **Growth Rate and Market Penetration:** My model assumes a slow deceleration of revenue growth from 10.2% down to 5.0% by 2030. The market is likely assuming:
    *   **Stronger and Longer Metal Card Adoption:** Higher global penetration of premium metal cards in the coming years.
    *   **Aggressive Arculus Success:** Significant and successful scaling of the Arculus security platform's SaaS-style revenue stream, which would command a much higher valuation multiple than a manufacturing business.

3.  **Discount Rate and Risk:** My conservative **15.0%** discount rate reflects a small-cap company with a historical complex financial structure (due to warrants/earnout liabilities and the Holdings structure). The market may be assuming a lower discount rate (e.g., 10-12%) due to:
    *   **Improved Capital Structure:** The warrant exercises and reduction in debt have strengthened the balance sheet.
    *   **Reduced Operational Risk:** The successful execution of the "CompoSecure Operating System" and the diversification from the Husky merger will lower the systematic business risk.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The fair value of **\$13.42** represents a very conservative "base case" valuation for the *existing* CompoSecure business (pre-Husky merger) with highly cautious financial assumptions. The current market price of **\$21.14** strongly suggests the market is already pricing in the successful and highly accretive execution of the **Husky Technologies merger**, a lower discount rate post-merger, and a more aggressive growth trajectory for the Arculus and international metal card segments. An investor who believes in management's projected 20% EPS accretion and the long-term success of the combined diversified entity would find the current price justifiable.
