## 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions (2025 - 2030)

The core business engine for INFU is the **Patient Services Segment** (primarily high-margin Oncology and growing Wound Care) and the **Device Solutions Segment** (rental business with high operating cash margins). Management's strategy is focused on profitable growth through favorable revenue mix (rentals and oncology) and operational efficiencies (ERP system).

| Category | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 Revenue Growth** | **6.0%** | The conservative end of management's updated full-year 2025 guidance range of 6% to 8%. |
| **2026 Revenue Growth** | **5.5%** | Conservative deceleration, but remains strong due to full realization of ERP efficiency benefits and continued growth in the high-margin Oncology and Advanced Wound Care segments post-processing/reimbursement fixes. |
| **2027 Revenue Growth** | **5.0%** | Continued, mature growth based on core market expansion. |
| **2028-2030 Revenue Growth** | **4.5%** | Slow, conservative deceleration toward the terminal rate, reflecting market maturity but stable demand for essential medical equipment rentals. |
| **2025 Adj. EBITDA Margin** | **20.0%** | The conservative end of management's "20% or higher" full-year 2025 guidance. This figure *includes* a drag from ERP implementation costs. |
| **2026-2030 Adj. EBITDA Margin** | **22.0%** | A conservative estimate based on management's expectation to **"sustain low 20s margins"** post-ERP completion in early 2026, driven by favorable revenue mix and operational efficiencies. |
| **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)** | **\$13.0** | A conservative long-term proxy, estimated as an average of historical D&A figures, which are a significant non-cash expense due to the large equipment rental asset base. |
| **Interest Expense** | **\$2.0** | A conservative estimate based on Q2 2025 interest expense, assuming the current debt level of \$26.3M and a blended cost of debt of approximately 7.6% (26.3 \* 0.076 $\approx$ 2.0). |
| **Tax Rate** | **0% (2025-2027)**, **25% (2028-2030)** | The company has a significant accumulated deficit (\$61.5M as of Q2 2025) and associated Net Operating Losses (NOLs), which will shield taxable income for several years. A 0% cash tax rate is assumed until 2028, and a conservative, standard blended federal/state rate of **25%** is applied thereafter. |
| **ROIC %** | **5.0%** | A conservative, positive rate is assumed. The company recently turned profitable (Q2 2025 net income of \$2.6M) but has a historical retained deficit. A 5.0% rate reflects a positive return on new capital without being overly aggressive for a recovering growth company. |

## 3. Financial Projections and Cash Flow Forecast

### A. Revenue and Margin Projections (USD Millions)

| Year | Revenue (A) | Revenue Growth | Adj. EBITDA Margin (B) | Adj. EBITDA (A * B) | D&A | Interest Expense | Pre-Tax Income | Tax Expense | Net Income from Operations | ROIC Income | **Total Projected Net Income** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$136.4 | 7.2% | 18.8% | \$25.6 | - | - | - | - | \$3.8 (Est) | - | - |
| **2025** | \$144.6 | 6.0% | 20.0% | \$28.9 | \$13.0 | \$2.0 | \$13.9 | \$0.0 | \$13.9 | \$0.0 | **\$13.9** |

| **2027** | \$160.1 | 5.0% | 22.0% | \$35.2 | \$13.0 | \$2.0 | \$20.2 | \$0.0 | \$20.2 | \$1.6 | **\$21.8** |
| **2028** | \$167.3 | 4.5% | 22.0% | \$36.8 | \$13.0 | \$2.0 | \$21.8 | \$5.5 | \$16.3 | \$2.3 | **\$18.6** |
| **2029** | \$174.9 | 4.5% | 22.0% | \$38.5 | \$13.0 | \$2.0 | \$23.5 | \$5.9 | \$17.6 | \$2.6 | **\$20.2** |
| **2030** | \$182.8 | 4.5% | 22.0% | \$40.2 | \$13.0 | \$2.0 | \$25.2 | \$6.3 | \$18.9 | \$3.0 | **\$21.9** |

*   *ROIC Income Calculation:* Net Income from previous year \* 5.0% ROIC. For 2026, \$13.9 \* 0.05 = \$0.7.
*   *Tax Expense Calculation:* Pre-Tax Income \* Tax Rate. The tax shield of NOLs is assumed to expire at the end of 2027.

### B. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The model assumes **Total Projected Net Income is the Cash Flow** for the period, as instructed.

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (15.0%) | Present Value (PV) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$13.9 | 0.870 | \$12.1 |
| **2026** | \$19.3 | 0.756 | \$14.6 |
| **2027** | \$21.8 | 0.658 | \$14.3 |
| **2028** | \$18.6 | 0.572 | \$10.6 |
| **2029** | \$20.2 | 0.497 | \$10.0 |
| **2030** | \$21.9 | 0.432 | \$9.5 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2025-2030)** | | | **\$71.1** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The **Terminal Value (TV)** is calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Method, assuming the 2030 cash flow grows indefinitely at a conservative, long-term maturity rate.

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **2.0%**. This reflects the slow, steady growth expected for a mature medical equipment/service provider in an essential sector of healthcare.
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** **15.0%**. This is a reasonable, high-end rate for a Small-Cap company like INFU with recent volatility and a higher risk profile than a large-cap stock.

$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g} $$

$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$21.9 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.15 - 0.02} = \frac{\$22.34}{\$0.13} = \$171.8 \text{ million} $$

**Present Value of Terminal Value (PV of TV):**

$$ \text{PV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} $$

$$ \text{PV of TV} = \$171.8 \times 0.432 = \$74.2 \text{ million} $$

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Explicit Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | \$71.1 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | \$74.2 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **\$145.3** |
| **Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$0.7 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | (\$26.3) |
| **Equity Value** | **\$119.7** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 20.43 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$5.86** |

## 5. Justification and Market Comparison

### Fair Value: **\$5.86 per share**

*(For comparison, you should note the current market value of the stock, which I cannot retrieve live. Assuming a hypothetical current market price of \$9.50 for the sake of the final justification.)*

**Hypothetical Market Price:** **\$9.50**

**Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value $\ll$ Market Value):**

My calculated Fair Value of **\$5.86** is significantly lower than the hypothetical current market price of **\$9.50**. This discrepancy indicates that the market is making more aggressive assumptions about the company's future performance than the conservative business engine analysis I have built based on management's own guidance.

**Market's Assumptions vs. My Conservative Assumptions:**

| Metric | My Conservative Assumption | Market's Likely Implied Assumption | Why the Difference? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Long-Term)** | Deceleration to 4.5% by 2028 | Sustained growth of 6% - 8% | The market is likely pricing in a successful, unhindered ramp-up of the **Advanced Wound Care** partnership and the **Chemo Mouthpiece** opportunity, which management explicitly called out as *delayed* and *revised* in 2025 guidance. |
| **Adj. EBITDA Margin (Post-2025)** | 22.0% (Low 20s) | 25.0% or Higher | The market may be projecting greater operational leverage from the ERP system and a faster/more dramatic mix shift toward the highest-margin Patient Services (Oncology/Rentals). |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | 15.0% (High Risk) | 10.0% - 12.0% (Lower Risk) | The market views INFU as having successfully executed its turnaround and deleveraging strategy, justifying a lower cost of capital, potentially viewing it as a safer, more mature company. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | 2.0% (Maturity) | 3.0% (Above-GDP Growth) | The market believes the specialized DME rental and service market offers persistent, non-cyclical growth above the general economy's rate. |

**Conclusion:**

My conservative valuation ($\text{\$5.86}$) is based on using the *low end* of all management's recent guidance (6.0% 2025 revenue growth and 20.0% EBITDA margin, despite a higher underlying run-rate) and explicitly incorporating the delays and challenges management noted in key growth areas (Wound Care and Chemo Mouthpiece).

The market ($\text{\$9.50}$) is likely valuing the stock based on the **full potential of the business engine**—assuming successful, rapid execution and resolution of the revenue-dampening factors (ERP completion, Wound Care/Chemo Mouthpiece ramp-up) and assigning a lower risk/discount rate. My valuation suggests a considerable **margin of safety** or that the stock is currently **overvalued** based on a purely conservative application of management's latest, revised guidance.
