### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

InfuSystem operates under a two-platform model: **Patient Services** (Oncology, Pain Management, Wound Care) and **Device Solutions** (Rentals, Sales, and Biomedical services). The growth is primarily driven by high-margin Patient Services, particularly Oncology and Wound Care, and the upcoming regulatory tailwind from the **NOPAIN Act**.

The management's most recent guidance will be the anchor for the initial projection:

*   **2024 Historical Net Revenue (FY):** \$136,400 thousand.
*   **2025 Net Revenue Guidance:** 6% to 8% growth. We will use the conservative midpoint of **7.0%** for 2025.
*   **2025 Adjusted EBITDA Margin Guidance:** 20% or higher. We will use a conservative **20.0%**.

#### Revenue Engine Assumptions:

1.  **2025 Revenue:** Based on management's midpoint guidance of 7.0% growth.
    *   **Justification:** This adheres to management's direct guidance.
2.  **2026-2027 Revenue:** A conservative growth rate of **5.0%** is assumed.
    *   **Justification:** This reflects a slowdown from the 2025 pace, but captures a positive impact from the full implementation of the **NOPAIN Act** in 2026, which offers a regulatory-backed tailwind for their pain management segment, coupled with continued growth in high-margin Oncology treatments and the expansion of the Wound Care business via partnerships. This is a conservative assumption given the high-margin segment momentum offset by the weak performance in biomedical services.
3.  **2028-2030 Revenue:** The growth rate is conservatively tapered down to a stable **3.0%** for the final three years.
    *   **Justification:** This reflects market maturity and competitive pressures outweighing the initial boost from the NOPAIN Act and partnership expansions, a conservative posture as required.
4.  **Long-Term/Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%** is assumed.
    *   **Justification:** A very conservative rate, slightly above long-term inflation, representing the business maturing to a stable, slow-growth state within the durable medical equipment industry.

#### Net Income and Margin Assumptions:

1.  **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** We will use the low end of the management's guidance for 2025 (**20.0%**) and conservatively hold this margin flat across all projection years.
    *   **Justification:** While gross margin is improving due to a favorable mix (Oncology/Rentals), we will assume Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) and depreciation/amortization pressures (especially pump depreciation) prevent further margin expansion, thereby ensuring a conservative estimate.
2.  **Net Income Margin:** Net Income will be calculated from EBITDA by subtracting estimated Depreciation & Amortization (D&A), Interest Expense (I), and Income Tax (T).
    *   **D&A:** Using the TTM Q3 2025 D&A of approximately \$16,000 thousand (based on 2024 total of \$20,950 thousand) and factoring in an average D&A-to-Revenue ratio of approximately 12.0% (based on historicals), we will apply this to projected revenue for D&A estimate. **Note:** Given the lack of a full, reliable 2024 10-K breakdown, a simplified margin assumption is necessary. We will instead calculate a conservative **Net Income Margin** based on the 2025 EBITDA guidance and a historical tax rate.
3.  **Simplified Net Income Margin Derivation (Conservative):**
    *   **2025 Adj. EBITDA Margin:** 20.0% (Management Guidance).
    *   **D&A/Revenue:** Approx. 12.0% (Based on internal TTM Q3 2025 estimates and historicals).
    *   **EBIT/Revenue:** 20.0% - 12.0% = 8.0%.
    *   **Interest Expense (I):** \$20,900 thousand debt at an estimated 8.0% interest rate = \$1,672 thousand. Average Annual Revenue (2025-2030) is $\sim$ \$163,000 thousand. I/Revenue $\approx$ 1.0%.
    *   **Tax Rate (T):** Use a conservative corporate rate of **25.0%**.
    *   **Net Income Margin (NIR):** EBIT (8.0%) - I (1.0%) = 7.0% (EBT Margin). NIR = EBT Margin * (1 - T) = 7.0% * (1 - 0.25) = **5.25%**.
    *   **Net Income Margin Assumption (2025-2030):** We will use a highly conservative flat **5.0%** Net Income Margin (NIR) for all years.

### 3. Projected Financials and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

#### A. Net Income Projection (in Thousands)

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Net Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) | Total Net Income (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 7.2% | \$136,400 | - | - | - | - |
| **2025** | 7.0% | \$145,948 | 5.0% | \$7,297 | \$0 | \$7,297 |
| **2026** | 5.0% | \$153,245 | 5.0% | \$7,662 | \$730 | \$8,392 |
| **2027** | 5.0% | \$160,907 | 5.0% | \$8,045 | \$839 | \$8,884 |
| **2028** | 3.0% | \$165,734 | 5.0% | \$8,287 | \$888 | \$9,175 |
| **2029** | 3.0% | \$170,706 | 5.0% | \$8,535 | \$918 | \$9,453 |
| **2030** | 3.0% | \$175,827 | 5.0% | \$8,791 | \$945 | \$9,736 |

**ROIC Calculation:**
*   **ROIC Percentage:** The company has been profitable but has a relatively low return on capital employed given its capital-intensive rental fleet. To be conservative, we assume a post-tax Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **10.0%**.
*   **ROIC Income (B):** For 2026, B = 2025 Total Net Income * 10.0% = \$7,297 * 0.10 = \$730. Net Income is assumed to go straight to cash for the next year, and this cash generates the ROIC income.

#### B. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

For this model, **Total Net Income** is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), as per the requirement to assume net income goes straight into cash.

**Assumptions for DCF:**

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **10.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate representing the company's cost of equity, given its size and moderate debt profile (Net Debt/EBITDA of 0.66x). |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative, long-term rate, slightly above historical inflation. |

| Year | Total Net Income (FCFE) (in Thousands) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (in Thousands) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$7,297 | 0.9091 | \$6,634 |
| **2026** | \$8,392 | 0.8264 | \$6,936 |
| **2027** | \$8,884 | 0.7513 | \$6,674 |
| **2028** | \$9,175 | 0.6830 | \$6,265 |
| **2029** | \$9,453 | 0.6209 | \$5,869 |
| **2030** | \$9,736 | 0.5645 | \$5,490 |
| **Sum of PVs (2025-2030)** | | | **\$37,868** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
The Terminal Value is the Present Value of all cash flows after 2030. The 2031 Cash Flow (FCFE) is projected using the 2030 Net Income, plus ROIC on the 2030 Net Income, continuing the ROIC assumption.

*   2031 Net Income: (\$9,736 * 1.03) * 5.0% + (\$9,736 * 10.0%) = \$501 + \$974 = \$1,475 thousand.
    *   *Note: Using a straight 2.0% growth rate on 2030 FCFE (as per the conservative 'g' assumption):*
    *   **2031 FCFE (Projected):** \$9,736 * (1 + 0.02) = \$9,931 thousand.

*   **Terminal Value in 2030:** TV = (2031 FCFE) / (r - g) = \$9,931 / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$124,138 thousand.
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value (PV-TV):** PV-TV = TV / (1 + r)^6 = \$124,138 / (1.10)^6 = \$124,138 * 0.5645 = **\$70,064 thousand**.

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows:**
*   NPV = Sum of PVs (2025-2030) + PV-TV
*   NPV = \$37,868 thousand + \$70,064 thousand = **\$107,932 thousand**

### 4. Fair Value Calculation

The fair value of equity is calculated as:
**Fair Value of Equity** = NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt

*   Fair Value of Equity = \$107,932 + \$1,000 - \$20,900
*   **Fair Value of Equity** = **\$88,032 thousand**

**Fair Value per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding

*   Fair Value per Share = \$88,032,000 / 20,336,183
*   **Fair Value per Share** = **\$4.33**

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **\$4.33** |
| **Current Stock Price (Feb 5, 2026)** | **\$7.66** |
| **Difference** | -\$3.33 |
| **Percentage Difference** | -43.5% |

### Justification for Difference

My calculated fair value of **\$4.33** per share is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$7.66** per share, indicating the market is making more aggressive assumptions about the company's future growth and profitability.

**Market Assumptions Implied by the Current Price:**

The market's current valuation of $\approx\$7.66$ implies one or more of the following:

1.  **Higher Growth Rate in Patient Services:** The market is likely pricing in a much more significant and sustained long-term growth rate than my conservative 5.0% (2026-2027) and 3.0% (2028-2030) assumptions. They may believe the **NOPAIN Act** and the high-margin Oncology and Wound Care segments will drive double-digit growth (e.g., 10-12%) for a longer period.
2.  **Significant Margin Expansion:** The market may be assuming the company's gross margin improvements (from favorable mix and efficiency) will translate into a much higher Net Income Margin than my conservative flat 5.0%. For example, a stable 7.0% Net Income Margin would substantially increase the valuation.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may perceive the company's business model (recurring patient services revenue with favorable regulatory support) to be less risky than my 10.0% discount rate implies, valuing future cash flows at a lower cost of capital (e.g., 8.0%).
4.  **Higher Terminal Value/Growth:** The market may be using a higher terminal growth rate ($g > 2.0\%$) to reflect the view that the durable medical equipment rental business is a stable, non-cyclical utility with a higher-than-average perpetual growth rate.
5.  **Acquisition Upside/Capital Return:** The market may be assigning value to the company's potential to continue paying down debt, increasing its stock buyback program (as seen in Q3 2025), or making value-accretive acquisitions that are not factored into the current revenue model.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

My valuation is a deliberate **conservative estimate** as mandated by the rules. The primary differences stem from:
*   **Conservative Margin Assumption (5.0% NIR):** This is the biggest single point of difference. My conservative 5.0% Net Income Margin assumes high operational costs (especially D&A on the rental fleet) will continue to suppress net profitability, despite management guiding to a 20%+ Adjusted EBITDA margin.
*   **Conservative Growth Rate Taper:** My rapid tapering of the revenue growth to 3.0% by 2028 does not give sufficient credit to the multi-year tailwind potential of the NOPAIN Act, which the market may believe will sustain growth closer to 7-10% for the entire period.

I will adhere to my conservative calculation. The market is giving a premium for the projected acceleration of the high-margin Patient Services segment and the resulting increase in cash flow/net income that the conservative model is intentionally suppressing.
