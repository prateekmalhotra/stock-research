## **2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)**

### **Business Engine Justification**

Aalberts' business engine is focused on **Mission-Critical Technologies** across three core segments: Building, Industry, and Semicon. The *'thrive 2030'* strategy centers on three key drivers:
1.  **Organic Growth:** Capitalizing on long-term megatrends like energy efficiency (Building), sustainable transportation (Industry), and the boom in advanced technology (Semicon). While 2025 is facing headwinds in Industry (automotive) and Semicon (inventory adjustments), the Building segment is showing resilience. The long-term driver for Semicon remains strong, driven by AI technologies.
2.  **Portfolio Optimization (M&A):** Management plans to add **EUR 800-1,000 million** in revenue through strategic acquisitions and divest **EUR 400-500 million** by 2030. This is a net increase of **EUR 300 - 600 million** in acquired revenue.
3.  **Operational Excellence:** Focus on cost-out and efficiency to deliver margin improvement.

### **Revenue Projections (in EUR millions)**

| Year | Starting Revenue | Organic Growth % (Conservative) | M&A Net Impact (Added Revenue) | Total Revenue Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | (3.4%) | N/A | 3,149.0 | Baseline from reported figures. |
| **2025** | 3,149.0 | 0.0% | 51.0 | **3,200.0** | Organic growth is projected to be *flat* for the full year 2025 (based on flat organic outlook for H2 2025). M&A is assumed to add a conservative EUR 51M (low-end of EUR 300M spread evenly over 6 years). |
| **2026** | 3,200.0 | 2.5% | 51.0 | **3,331.0** | Conservative organic growth of 2.5%, modest recovery as headwinds ease. Consistent M&A addition (EUR 300M net M&A / 6 years). |
| **2027** | 3,331.0 | 3.5% | 51.0 | **3,498.8** | Organic growth improves as the Semicon cycle turns and North American expansion matures. |
| **2028** | 3,498.8 | 4.0% | 51.0 | **3,699.8** | Approaching long-term growth as strategic actions fully materialize. |
| **2029** | 3,699.8 | 4.0% | 51.0 | **3,908.8** | Continued strong organic growth. |
| **2030** | 3,908.8 | 4.5% | 51.0 | **4,136.9** | **Conservative Target Check:** My projected 2030 Revenue of EUR 4,136.9M is *below* the company's stated minimum target of EUR >4,500M, making this a highly conservative estimate.

## **3. Margin & Net Income Projection**

Net Income is derived by first estimating the Net Income Margin based on the EBITA margin trajectory and then applying a 25.0% tax rate.

| Year | Revenue (EUR M) | EBITA Margin % (Guidance/Target) | Net Income Margin % (Conservative) | Net Income (EUR M) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 3,149.0 | 15.0% | 10.0% | 314.9 | Using a proxy 10.0% Net Income Margin for 2024 for simplified calculation. |
| **2025** | 3,200.0 | 13.0% | 8.0% | 256.0 | **Conservative:** Using the *low end* of the management's revised 13-14% EBITA margin outlook, which translates to an 8.0% Net Income Margin. |
| **2026** | 3,331.0 | 14.0% | 9.0% | 299.8 | Recovery begins as operational excellence and market conditions improve. |
| **2027** | 3,498.8 | 15.5% | 10.5% | 367.4 | Continued margin expansion toward the 2030 target. |
| **2028** | 3,699.8 | 16.5% | 11.5% | 425.5 | Accelerating margin improvement due to scale and cost-out programs. |
| **2029** | 3,908.8 | 17.5% | 12.5% | 488.6 | Approaching the 2030 target. |
| **2030** | 4,136.9 | 18.0% | 13.0% | 537.8 | **Conservative:** Using a 13.0% Net Income Margin, which is well below a potential 18% EBITA margin (e.g., 18% EBITA - 25% tax on a simplified basis would be closer to 13.5%).

## **4. Free Cash Flow (Net Income) Projection with ROIC**

The projected net income is treated as the free cash flow. The additional income from reinvested cash (prior year's net income) is calculated using a conservative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

*   **Conservative ROIC:** 10.0% (Significantly lower than the 2023 ROCE of 16.8% and 2030 target of >18%) [cite: 9 from step 1, 2].

| Year | Base Net Income (EUR M) | Prior Year's Cash (EUR M) | ROIC Income (10.0%) (EUR M) | Total Net Income / Free Cash Flow (EUR M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 256.0 | 314.9 | 31.5 | **287.5** |
| **2026** | 299.8 | 287.5 | 28.8 | **328.6** |
| **2027** | 367.4 | 328.6 | 32.9 | **400.3** |
| **2028** | 425.5 | 400.3 | 40.0 | **465.5** |
| **2029** | 488.6 | 465.5 | 46.6 | **535.2** |
| **2030** | 537.8 | 535.2 | 53.5 | **591.3** |

## **5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

### **Assumptions**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** 9.0%
    *   *Justification:* This is a reasonable WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) proxy for a cyclical industrial technology company with a solid balance sheet but operating in fragmented, low-growth (Building, Industry) and volatile (Semicon) markets.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** 2.0%
    *   *Justification:* Reflects a conservative long-term inflation and GDP growth rate for the highly developed markets (primarily Europe and North America) where Aalberts operates.

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Year (t) | Projected FCF (EUR M) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.09)^t) | NPV of FCF (EUR M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | 287.5 | 0.9174 | 263.8 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | 328.6 | 0.8417 | 276.6 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | 400.3 | 0.7722 | 309.1 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | 465.5 | 0.7084 | 330.3 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | 535.2 | 0.6499 | 347.8 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | 591.3 | 0.5963 | 352.4 |
| **Sum of Projected FCFs (NPV)** | | | **1,880.0** |

### **Terminal Value Calculation**

Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the 2030 Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Perpetual Growth formula:
$$TV = (FCF_{2030} * (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$$
$$TV = (591.3 * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.09 - 0.02) = 603.1 / 0.07$$
$$TV = 8,615.7 \text{ EUR Million}$$

### **NPV of Terminal Value**

The Terminal Value is discounted back to the present (t=6):
$$NPV_{TV} = TV / (1 + \text{Discount Rate})^6$$
$$NPV_{TV} = 8,615.7 / (1 + 0.09)^6 = 8,615.7 * 0.5963$$
$$NPV_{TV} = 5,138.9 \text{ EUR Million}$$

### **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

$$\text{TEV} = \text{Sum of Projected FCFs (NPV)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$$
$$\text{TEV} = 1,880.0 \text{ EUR M} + 5,138.9 \text{ EUR M} = \text{7,018.9 EUR Million}$$

---

## **6. Fair Value Calculation**

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{TEV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$
$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = 7,018.9 \text{ M} + 178.3 \text{ M} - 954.9 \text{ M}$$
$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{6,242.3 EUR Million}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \text{Fair Value of Equity} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$
$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = 6,242.3 \text{ M} / 108.04 \text{ M}$$
$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \text{57.78 EUR}$$

## **Fair Value Summary**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | 7,018.9 EUR Million |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | 6,242.3 EUR Million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **57.78 EUR** |
| **Current Stock Price** | (Note: The current market price for AALBF would need to be checked at the time of an actual transaction. Using a proxy price for justification.) |

## **7. Market Comparison and Justification**

Assuming a representative recent closing price for AALB.AS (main listing) of approximately **EUR 47.00** (or the corresponding AALBF price, which is subject to currency fluctuations and is an ADR/OTC listing), the calculated **Fair Value per Share of EUR 57.78** suggests the stock is **undervalued** by the market based on this conservative DCF model.

### **Justification for Difference (Market vs. Model)**

The model's valuation is higher than the current market price, suggesting the market is making more conservative assumptions about one or more of the key valuation inputs.

| Model Assumption | Model Value | Market's Likely Assumption | Why the Market is More Cautious |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2030 Revenue Target** | EUR 4.14 Billion | Closer to EUR 3.8 - 4.0 Billion | My model is already conservative compared to the management's target of >EUR 4.5B, but the market is likely discounting the M&A contribution and/or the ability to achieve full organic growth due to current headwinds. |
| **Long-Term Net Income Margin** | 13.0% (from 18% EBITA) | Closer to 11.0% - 12.0% | The market is skeptical about the ability to reach the >18% EBITA margin target in a highly competitive, fragmented industrial market, especially given the margin pressure seen in 2025's outlook (13-14% EBITA). |
| **Conservative ROIC** | 10.0% | Possibly 8.0% - 9.0% | Lower return expectations on reinvested capital due to the current environment and the risk of M&A integration failures. |
| **Perpetual Growth Rate** | 2.0% | 1.0% - 1.5% | The market may price in a lower long-term growth rate due to the company's significant exposure to the mature European market and the cyclical nature of its Semicon/Industry segments. |

**Conclusion on Fair Value Discrepancy:**
The primary driver for the discrepancy is likely the market's skepticism regarding the execution of the *'thrive 2030'* margin targets. The market is pricing in either a significantly lower terminal growth rate **or** a lower long-term Net Income Margin than my conservative projection of 13.0% (derived from the management's 18% EBITA target). My valuation suggests that if Aalberts successfully executes its 'thrive 2030' plan and achieves a low-end Net Income Margin of 13.0%, the stock is significantly undervalued.
