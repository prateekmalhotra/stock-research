## Business Summary

NCR Voyix is a business-to-business (B2B) technology company that provides the essential software, services, and hardware needed by large corporations to operate their commerce and payment systems. Their customers are typically large retailers, major restaurant chains (like fast-food chains), and financial institutions (banks and credit unions), primarily operating across North America and Europe. The core business model is centered on transitioning clients to recurring, cloud-based software subscriptions for services like digital payments, self-checkout, and inventory management, which generates predictable revenue over time. While they still sell physical hardware, such as specialized cash registers and ATMs, the company's financial health increasingly depends on the high-margin, stable income derived from these long-term software contracts and managed services.

## Business Model Risk

The company faces significant near-term threats, including intense competition from newer financial technology firms that may offer more agile cloud solutions; if NCR Voyix cannot rapidly modernize its legacy systems, customers may switch providers, immediately harming subscription income. Furthermore, as VYX relies on large businesses for technology upgrades, a global economic slowdown could cause major clients (like banks or retailers) to delay or cancel large capital spending projects, reducing hardware and installation revenue. A critical long-term risk is the successful completion of the ongoing shift from selling physical products to selling software subscriptions; if existing clients are resistant to migrating their operations to the new cloud platform, the projected increase in stable, profitable recurring revenue will not materialize. Finally, because the company handles massive amounts of sensitive transaction data for banks and retailers, any failure in cybersecurity or non-compliance with global data privacy laws could lead to severe reputational damage, regulatory fines, and the loss of major, long-term contracts, a threat that has historically plagued large payment processors.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX), from its deep roots to its present-day identity as a focused technology company.

### The Foundation: From Cash Registers to Digital Commerce

1.  **Original Inception (1884):** The company's story begins with the founding of the National Cash Register Company (NCR) in 1884, but its roots go back to the invention of the mechanical cash register in 1879.
2.  **The Founding Goal:** The original purpose of the mechanical cash register was to solve a major problem in retail: **"rampant pilferage" (theft) and the lack of accurate records** for daily sales. The machine forced an official record of every transaction.
3.  **An Early Innovation Pioneer:** Under the leadership of John H. Patterson, the company was a pioneer not just in technology, but also in modern business. It established one of the first sales training schools and introduced social welfare programs for factory workers.
4.  **The Long Evolution:** Over the next century, the company constantly adapted, moving from mechanical devices to electromechanical machines, then into mainframe computers, personal computers, and eventually automated teller machines (ATMs).
5.  **A New Era and Identity (2023):** NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX) was officially born in October 2023 as a separate, independent public company. It was created from a corporate "spin-off" of the much larger, older NCR Corporation.

### Why NCR Voyix Was Founded (The Spin-Off)

6.  **The Problem of Complexity (Headwind):** The original NCR Corporation had become too large and complex, operating two very different types of businesses: one focused on physical banking hardware like ATMs, and one focused on retail and restaurant cloud software.
7.  **The Goal of the Separation (Founding Reason):** The split was a strategic move to create two more focused and nimble companies, allowing each to concentrate its energy and investment on its own market.
8.  **The New Focus (VYX):** NCR Voyix kept the **digital commerce** side of the business, focusing specifically on solutions for **Retail and Restaurant businesses**. The ATM and self-service banking unit became a separate company, NCR Atleos (NATL).
9.  **The Name Explained:** The name uses the legacy "NCR" to represent its long history and expertise, while **"Voyix" comes from "voyage,"** signifying its role as a guide, helping customers on their journey to digital transformation.

### Problems, Solutions, and the Present Goal

10. **A Major Headwind (Cyber Attack):** Before the spin-off, the predecessor company suffered a significant cyber ransomware incident in April 2023, which impacted some cloud services for its customers.
11. **Dealing with the Headwind:** The company incurred millions in expenses but managed to recover a portion through insurance and built a new, secure cloud environment to restore and host the affected applications.
12. **The Post-Split Headwind:** Immediately after the spin-off, the new NCR Voyix faced the challenge of untangling shared operations, like IT and human resources, which initially led to financial inefficiencies and required new corporate structures.
13. **The Innovative Solution (Platform-Led Strategy):** The company is transitioning its customers from older, on-site software to a modern, **cloud-native, platform-led model** that works through the internet. This shift helps provide more predictable, subscription-based revenue, which is a key goal.
14. **Process Innovation and Cost Control:** To combat high operational costs, the company implemented a cost-saving solution by moving to remote support; now, devices in a store or restaurant can connect directly to a help desk, reducing the need to send out technicians.
15. **A Key Business Transformation:** NCR Voyix also chose to outsource its hardware manufacturing, shifting its focus almost entirely to being a **software and services provider**, which further supports its goal of becoming a subscription-based, digital company.
16. **Powerful Tailwinds:** The major tailwind (a favorable market force) is the general market trend of **digital transformation** where retailers and restaurants worldwide are urgently moving away from old physical systems to interconnected, cloud-based software for managing everything from ordering to inventory.

### NCR Voyix Today

17. **Current Goal:** Today, NCR Voyix’s main goal is to be the global leader in providing software and services for digital commerce in the retail and restaurant industries.
18. **The Core Business:** They offer solutions like Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, self-checkout kiosks, and specialized restaurant software, which are all integrated into a single platform that helps businesses run smoothly and enhance customer experiences.
19. **Future Focus:** The company is now focused on investing in its cloud platform and using data and AI to help its customers drive better results, leveraging its nearly 140 years of experience in commerce.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX) is primarily built on its vast, sticky, and embedded customer base in essential business operations, combined with a strategic and successful shift from a hardware legacy to a modern, recurring software platform.

Here is an analysis of the company's competitive advantages in simple terms.

### The Moat of NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX)

1.  **Massive Scale and Legacy Trust:** The company, building on the 140-year history of NCR, has been the world's largest supplier of Point of Sale (POS) software for the enterprise and mid-market for eight consecutive years. This long-standing presence has established deep brand equity and trust with some of the largest retailers, grocery chains, and restaurant brands globally, which is a powerful barrier to entry.

2.  **Mission-Critical High Switching Costs (Customer Stickiness):**
    *   The core of NCR Voyix's business is providing mission-critical software and services for running a business (like POS, payments, and inventory).
    *   Switching a company's entire transaction system is a complex, time-consuming, and risky process, especially for large enterprises, creating a strong deterrent to leaving.
    *   The company is actively converting its large installed base to its new cloud-based, subscription platform, which further enhances customer "stickiness."

3.  **High Level of Recurring Revenue (Contracts are Sticky):**
    *   A significant portion of the company's revenue is **recurring** (contracts are not one-time sales). Recurring revenue recently constituted 56% of total sales, with a company target to grow this to 65% by 2027.
    *   This recurring revenue comes from long-term software subscriptions and ongoing managed services, providing a predictable and stable financial foundation.

### Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Market Position

4.  **Special Position: Integrated Unified Commerce Platform:**
    *   What truly differentiates it is the ability to offer a single, unified platform that powers POS, payments, and self-checkout solutions.
    *   For customers, getting all these mission-critical functions from one deeply integrated provider is often simpler and more reliable than piecing together solutions from multiple vendors, which strengthens the value proposition and pricing power.

5.  **Pricing Power from "Payments Attach":**
    *   The company has a strong "payment attach rate" on new customer contracts, meaning it successfully bundles payment processing services with its software platform.
    *   Payments processing is a high-margin, sticky revenue stream. This integration allows NCR Voyix to expand its average revenue per customer (ARPU) and gives it an additional, lucrative revenue lever beyond the initial software subscription fee.

### Growth Reason, Displacement Risk, and Moat-Building Actions

6.  **Reason for Growth:** The company's long-term growth and market position stem from its historical dominance in transaction technology, but its *current* strategy for future growth is the decisive **strategic pivot to a software-first, cloud-native SaaS model** after the 2023 spin-off. This shift is key to improving profitability and reducing reliance on lower-margin hardware sales.

7.  **Ease of Displacement (Capital Alone is Not Enough):**
    *   It would be extremely difficult for a competitor, even one with a lot of capital, to quickly displace NCR Voyix.
    *   A new competitor would have to replicate the decades of industry expertise, the trust of the world's largest retailers, the vast global service and support network, and the sheer volume of customers already running their daily operations on the Voyix platform. The cost and time to build a comparable installed base and reputation are massive barriers.

8.  **Moat-Building Actions:**
    *   The company's primary action to ensure a solid moat is its focus on accelerating **recurring software and services revenue** and expanding its **cloud platform sites**.
    *   By shifting customers to the cloud-native platform, they reduce reliance on old, custom systems, making the customer relationship more standardized, scalable, and stickier through continuous updates and seamless payment integration.

9.  **Investment in R&D and Innovation:**
    *   The company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge in the fast-paced retail and restaurant technology markets.
    *   It invests in R&D to bring new cloud-based solutions to the market, such as next-generation self-checkout and unified commerce solutions. This continuous investment is critical to staying ahead of newer, nimble competitors and ensuring its software platform remains a relevant and valuable core for its customers' businesses.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX) are centered around its transformation into a focused software and services company following the corporate separation and strategic divestitures.

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Simplification and Focus from Spin-off:** The completion of the spin-off of its ATM business (NCR Atleos) makes NCR Voyix a pure-play digital commerce company focused on the Retail and Restaurant segments. This simplification allows management to dedicate all resources to its core software and payments platform business.
2.  **Digital Banking Divestiture and Capital Inflow:** The sale of the Digital Banking segment for a significant cash price will provide a large capital infusion. This cash can be used to pay down debt, fund growth initiatives, or return capital to shareholders, all of which can boost the stock price.
3.  **Cost Reduction and Margin Expansion:** Management has initiated a multi-phase cost alignment program, including staff reductions and exiting non-core businesses, aimed at driving significant cost savings. This focus on efficiency is expected to immediately expand Adjusted EBITDA (profit) margins.
4.  **Improved Visibility and Reporting:** The clean-up of the business structure, moving past the complexity of the spin-off, delayed country transfers, and discontinued operations, should lead to clearer financial reporting. This clearer picture can help investors better value the core, recurring revenue business.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Platform Conversion and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) Growth:** The core strategy is to onboard existing customers to the cloud-based **Voyix Commerce Platform** to drive deeper relationships and capture greater wallet share. This shift is key to growing higher-margin subscription revenue and increasing the total value of its customer base.
2.  **Payments Attachment Growth:** NCR Voyix is integrating its payment processing services with its point-of-sale platform, reporting high rates of payment attachment for new mid-market customers. Expanding payment services is a high-growth, high-margin driver for the company.
3.  **New Customer Acquisition and Market Share:** The company is focused on "secular growth trends" to win new customers, also known as 'new logos,' across its Restaurant and Retail segments. Continuous expansion of its customer base in enterprise and mid-market is a fundamental long-term growth engine.
4.  **Strategic Focus on Software, Services, and AI:** By partnering for hardware (like with Ennoconn Corporation), the company is pivoting R&D and capital spending toward its core software, services, and advanced applications, including new AI-accelerated suites. This strategy positions them to capture the high-value digital transformation trend in commerce.

### Management's Explicit Strategy (CEO Commentary)

*   **Focus on Core Growth:** CEO David Wilkinson has stated that the formula for growth is the same across all segments: "capitalize on the secular growth trends to win net new customers and gain market share."
*   **Driving Platform Adoption:** Management is clearly prioritizing the conversion of its customer base: "connect and onboard existing customers to our platform to drive deeper relationships and capture greater wallet share."
*   **Commitment to Margin Expansion:** The management team explicitly links the business shift to financial improvement, stating that these actions will "improve EBITDA margin through the shift in our business" and is coupled with a "continued focus on efficiencies and productivity initiatives."
*   **Maximizing Shareholder Value:** Management has affirmed its commitment to this strategy as the "right formula to drive significant value creation" and is "fully committed to delivering results to compound shareholder return."

## Management Record

The management analysis of NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX) for an investor is outlined below:

### **I. Management Transition and Leadership Background**

1.  **CEO Change:** The company underwent a major leadership change with the unexpected stepping down of CEO David Wilkinson in February 2025, just over a year after the spin-off.
2.  **Transition Context:** Wilkinson, who had been with the former NCR Corporation for over a decade, successfully led the company through the complex separation and initial restructuring phase.
3.  **Current CEO Appointment:** **James G. Kelly** was appointed President and CEO in February 2025, moving from his role as Executive Chair.
4.  **CEO Track Record (Value Creation):** Kelly is an experienced payments and technology executive, having served as CEO of EVO Payments, which he led through its IPO and subsequent $4 billion acquisition by Global Payments in 2023, demonstrating a clear track record of delivering shareholder value through M&A and growth.
5.  **Executive Experience:** Kelly's background also includes senior financial and operating leadership roles, such as President, COO, and CFO at Global Payments, providing deep expertise in the payments sector central to NCR Voyix's strategy.
6.  **Team Tenure:** The average tenure for the current management team is relatively short, at approximately 1.8 years (as of early 2025), which is typical for a recently spun-off and restructured entity.

### **II. Key Past Decisions and Performance Track Record**

7.  **Corporate Split (Previous Management):** NCR Voyix was created in October 2023 as a spin-off from the former NCR Corporation to separate the digital commerce business (Voyix) from the ATM business (NCR Atleos), a strategic decision aimed at unlocking shareholder value by allowing each focused entity to better pursue its growth model.
8.  **Digital Banking Divestiture (Kelly as Chair):** A key strategic decision was the agreement to sell the cloud-based digital banking business to Veritas Capital for $2.45 billion in 2024; Kelly, as Executive Chair, drove this sale process to further streamline operations and focus exclusively on the core Retail and Restaurant segments.
9.  **Shareholder Value Action:** Management actively sought to enhance shareholder value by completing a $100 million share buyback program in February 2025.
10. **Recent Financial Performance:** The company's 2024 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) paid out below target (45%), indicating that the initial management structure underperformed against its EBITDA and revenue goals in the first year post-spin.
11. **Stock Performance:** The stock price has recently shown momentum challenges, underperforming the S&P 500 in the six months prior to early 2025, framing a turnaround challenge for the new CEO.

### **III. Future Strategy and Vision (Under New CEO)**

13. **Platform Focus:** The strategy is built around the **Voyix Commerce Platform (VCP)**, which aims to accelerate the shift to recurring cloud-based revenue and drive margin expansion beyond 20%.
14. **Monetization Strategy:** A key growth driver is the plan to integrate and monetize payments across its platform, aiming to capture volume from the company's estimated $1.4 trillion in U.S. commerce transactions processed annually.
15. **Competitive Differentiation:** CEO Kelly emphasizes leveraging the company's historical position as the original architect of POS systems to offer a non-disruptive path for long-time customers to modernize their systems, accelerating platform adoption.
16. **Market Expansion:** Management is also targeting new growth areas, including expansion into the commercial fuel sector.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure for NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX), the system appears to be **primarily structured to align with shareholder interests**, though the personal direct ownership of the top executive is low.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership is Mixed, but Large Insider Shareholders Exist:** The CEO, Jim Kelly, has a very low direct ownership of approximately 0.1% of the company's shares, which is not a strong indicator of individual alignment ("higher the better").
2.  **Total Insider Ownership is Substantial:** Total "insider" ownership is reported to be around 14.78%, largely held by a few key individuals, suggesting a significant portion of the company is held by parties deemed insiders, which includes some directors.
3.  **Compensation Structure is Heavily Performance-Based:** The CEO's total compensation is heavily weighted toward variable, at-risk pay, with a very low base salary portion (about 7.9%) and the vast majority (over 92%) derived from bonuses, stock, and options.
4.  **Long-Term Incentives (LTI) are Tied to Shareholder Value:** Long-Term Incentive (LTI) awards, in the form of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PBRSUs), are explicitly linked to metrics that benefit shareholders, such as **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** and **Free Cash Flow Conversion** over a three-year cliff-vesting period.
5.  **Stock Price Hurdles Further Align Incentives:** A portion of the PBRSUs has specific vesting conditions that require the common stock price to reach and maintain pre-determined, higher thresholds (e.g., $22.00 to $26.00) over a three-year period, directly incentivizing stock appreciation.
6.  **Good Governance Practices are in Place:** The company prohibits directors and executive officers from engaging in hedging or pledging company securities, preventing executives from insulating themselves from the financial risk of a drop in the stock price.

### **Conclusion**

*   **Incentive to Act in the Interest of Shareholders:** **Yes.** The executive compensation structure is heavily weighted toward equity awards that only pay out upon the achievement of key shareholder metrics—specifically, relative stock performance (TSR) and improved financial health (Free Cash Flow). This design forces management to focus on long-term value creation.
*   **Incentivized to Just Line Their Own Pockets:** **No.** While high compensation packages are standard for executives, the low base salary and strong reliance on performance-based, multi-year-vesting equity makes it difficult for them to "line their pockets" without first delivering substantial value to the general shareholders through stock price appreciation and financial/operational improvements.

## Long Thesis

NCR Voyix is rapidly transforming from a complex seller of physical hardware (like old registers) into a focused, modern technology company selling high-margin, predictable software subscriptions and payment processing services to major retailers and restaurant chains. In the near term, the company has completed a major corporate clean-up, sold off its non-core banking division for billions of dollars in cash, and initiated deep cost cuts. This immediately simplifies the business and boosts profits. Long term, the bull case rests on the company's powerful advantage: its existing customer base is massive, global, and highly dependent on VYX's essential systems. Because switching these systems is extremely difficult, VYX can successfully convert these customers to its new, high-margin cloud platform. This shift will lock in stable, growing subscription revenue and allow VYX to earn lucrative fees from integrating payment processing directly into its software, exponentially increasing the value of every customer.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that management successfully executes its massive internal pivot, convincing its large, legacy customer base to migrate from old systems to the new, recurring, cloud-based software platform without significant resistance. We must also assume that the new CEO, who has a strong track record in payments, can accelerate the integration of high-margin payment processing into the core platform, leading to substantial and rapid increases in revenue per customer. Finally, the cash infusion from the Digital Banking sale must be used efficiently to either pay down debt or reinvest in growth, maximizing shareholder returns.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the key flaws and vulnerabilities (the Bear Case) in the optimistic long thesis for NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX).

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis (Bear Case)

The long thesis overstates the defensibility of the existing customer base, minimizes the financial drag and execution risks of a multi-year transformation, and underestimates the ferocity of the new competitive landscape.

### 1. High-Risk, Multi-Year Execution of Cloud Migration

*   **Assumption of "No Significant Resistance" is Flawed:** The core bull case rests on successfully convincing a massive legacy customer base (Tier 1 retailers and restaurant chains) to undergo a difficult and costly enterprise-wide system migration. This transition is not seamless but involves significant technical hurdles, downtime risk, and a high likelihood of operational disruption for the customer.
*   **Slow Pace of Transformation:** Despite the urgency, the goal to migrate to the new cloud platform is a multi-year process with inherent delays; as of late 2024, only around 20% of VYX sites were connected to the platform. The overall transformation and restructuring costs are recurring and continue to weigh on financial results well into 2025.
*   **Loss of Core Software Revenue:** The company is experiencing a decline in one-time perpetual software license revenue, which is a negative signal as they pivot the business model. This suggests that some customers are holding off on major spending or are considering competitor solutions as their current license expires.

### 2. Failure of the "Sticky System" Moat due to Intense Competition

*   **Aggressive, Cloud-Native Competition:** The market is not a duopoly of legacy players; nimble, purely cloud-native competitors like **Toast** in the restaurant sector are aggressively gaining market share with superior, modern, integrated software platforms. Additionally, payment powerhouses like Fiserv (**Clover**), **Square**, and large enterprise rivals like **Oracle** are active threats. [cite: 3, 5, 6, 7 in step 2, 12 in step 2]
*   **Payments Opportunity is a War, Not a Windfall:** The bull case's predicted "exponentially increasing value" from integrating payments is true for the industry, but VYX faces formidable competition from global payments giants (PayPal, Fiserv, Stripe, Adyen, etc.). VYX must invest heavily and compete purely on payments technology, pricing, and integration speed in a crowded field.
*   **Risk of Disintermediation:** New payment technologies and alternative POS platforms (especially mobile-first) could bypass traditional POS systems entirely, eroding VYX's installed-base advantage faster than they can convert customers to their new platform.

### 3. Financial Headwinds and Capital Allocation Risk

*   **Digital Banking Sale Creates an Earnings Hole:** The sale of the digital banking division, while deleveraging, removed a high-margin, growth-oriented asset that had a "significant runway for growth." The loss of this earnings power is expected to result in a near-term reduction in GAAP net income, directly contradicting the claim that the sale "immediately... boosts profits."
*   **Hardware Transition Complications:** The plan to move hardware manufacturing to an Outsource Design Manufacturing (ODM) model to streamline the business is facing delays, which is impacting revenue guidance. This extended transition introduces new operational risk, reliance on a third party (Ennoconn Corp.), and volatility due to factors like potential tariffs.
*   **Legacy Perception and Low Multiple:** The market still widely perceives VYX as a slower-growth, legacy hardware company, resulting in a lower valuation multiple than pure software peers. Overcoming this perception requires years of consistent, high-velocity subscription growth, which may be difficult to achieve amid intense competition and internal transformation costs.

## Next Steps

You have compiled a comprehensive analysis of NCR Voyix Corporation (VYX), successfully establishing the core bull case (cloud transformation, debt paydown, payments attach) and the critical bear case (slow execution, intense competition, loss of Digital Banking earnings).

The initial search provided excellent, very recent (2025/2026 data) on many key metrics. This new information helps quantify the previously vague parts of the thesis and allows for a more focused next set of questions.

Here are the most important remaining questions to investigate, based on the gaps in your initial analysis and the data gathered:

### **1. Quantifying the Success of the Core Transformation (Software and Platform)**

*   **Software ARR Growth Rate and Retention:** The data shows Software ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) growth of 4%-9% in 2025 quarters. Is this pace fast enough to please the market, or is it too slow given the high valuation multiples of pure-play SaaS peers? Find the *current* Software Net Retention Rate (NRR) or Gross Retention Rate to confirm the customer "stickiness."
*   **The Payments Attach Rate:** The CEO's background is in payments, and the bull case relies on payments attach for margin expansion. What is the current **Payments Attach Rate** (e.g., percentage of VCP sites using Voyix Pay) on new sales, and what are the management targets for 2026?

### **2. De-Risking the Debt and Free Cash Flow**

*   **Final Free Cash Flow (FCF) Quality:** The 2025 FCF guidance (\$170M - \$190M) **excludes** restructuring and transformation costs. What is the total estimated cash spend on these *excluded* restructuring costs for 2025? Comparing FCF *before* and *after* these one-time costs is essential for an accurate view of liquidity.
*   **Leverage Target vs. Reality:** VYX has paid down significant debt, reducing total outstanding to around \$1.105 billion. The target leverage ratio is ~2.0x net debt/Adjusted EBITDA. Confirm the final, *actual* leverage ratio after the Digital Banking sale is fully accounted for.

### **3. Competitive and Valuation Gap Analysis (The Battle for Market Share)**

*   **The Enterprise vs. SMB Battle:** You know VYX is the large Enterprise player facing Toast and Clover in the mid-market/SMB space. How much of VYX's *total revenue* comes from the smaller, more competitive mid-market/SMB segment that Toast dominates?
*   **Valuation Comparison:** The searches show VYX trading at around 9.2x - 12.0x EV/EBITDA. Find the **forward EV/EBITDA** multiple for **Toast** (Restaurant peer) and a software-focused payment peer (like **Global Payments** or **Fiserv**) to quantify the exact discount/premium VYX trades at and explain the gap.

### **4. Execution Risk of the Hardware Outsource Pivot**

*   **ODM Transition Status:** The hardware manufacturing outsource to Ennoconn Corp. is a critical part of the cost-cutting and business-simplification catalyst. What is the latest update on the transition timeline and is it still facing delays as the Bear Case suggests?
*   **Tariff Impact:** The company noted the trade tariff cost to be between \$8 million and \$12 million for the year. Have they specified how the offsetting mitigations are performing to keep the final net cost within this range?
