### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

SandRidge Energy is an independent oil and gas company focused on the Mid-Continent region (Oklahoma and Kansas). The business engine is driven by three main factors: **stable, low-decline base production**, **high-return organic development projects**, and **strategic, value-accretive acquisitions (M&A)**.

**Conservative Business Engine Assumptions:**

*   **Production:** The company states its production base has an estimated **single-digit annual decline** over the next ten years. To be conservative, I will assume a natural annual decline of **5%** for the existing production base. This conservative decline is then partially offset by capital projects and modest M&A.
*   **Revenue Growth Factor:** Management is focused on "high-return, organic growth projects" and is "vigilant in evaluating further merger and acquisition opportunities". Due to the company's flexibility, no debt, and cash position, a modest growth factor is applied.
    *   I will assume a **Conservative Organic Growth/M&A Factor** that counteracts a portion of the natural decline, resulting in a **0% net annual production growth** (i.e., flat production) for the forecast period (2026-2030) after the initial 2025 guide. This is a very conservative assumption, essentially projecting no *net* benefit from their capital program, which is contrary to management's stated goals but aligns with the rule to be conservative.
*   **Commodity Price Assumptions (World Knowledge & Conservatism):** The realized price is a critical, volatile factor. To remain conservative and avoid aggressive commodity forecasts:
    *   **Oil Price:** A long-term, conservative West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of **$70.00/Bbl** is used, well below current peaks but above the company's profitable threshold of $40 WTI.
    *   **Natural Gas Price:** A conservative Henry Hub (HH) price of **$3.50/MMBtu** is used.
    *   **NGL Price:** Assumed to be **35% of the WTI Oil Price** (a conservative proxy for the volatile NGL market).

#### **2025 Revenue Baseline Calculation**

Based on the 2025 Guidance and Price Assumptions:

| Product | 2025 Guidance (Midpoint) | Price Assumption | Revenue (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Oil** | 1.2 MMBbls | $70.00/Bbl | $84.0 |
| **Natural Gas Liquids (NGL)** | 2.15 MMBbls | $24.50/Bbl (35% of WTI) | $52.7$ |
| **Natural Gas** | 19.0 Bcf (19,000 MMcf) | $3.50/MMBtu | $66.5$ |
| **Total Estimated 2025 Revenue** | | | **$203.2 million** |

#### **Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)**

The conservative assumption of **0% net annual production growth** (flat revenue) is applied from 2026 onwards, meaning the 2025 revenue serves as the base for all subsequent years.

| Year | Projected Revenue (millions USD) | Growth Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $203.2$ | Calculated based on 2025 Production Guidance Midpoint and conservative commodity prices. |
| **2026** | $203.2$ | **0% Net Growth Assumption:** Natural 5% decline is assumed to be exactly offset by capital program and/or small M&A, a very conservative long-term outlook for a cash-rich, zero-debt E&P company. |
| **2027** | $203.2$ | **0% Net Growth Assumption** |
| **2028** | $203.2$ | **0% Net Growth Assumption** |
| **2029** | $203.2$ | **0% Net Growth Assumption** |
| **2030** | $203.2$ | **0% Net Growth Assumption** |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

The Net Income projection utilizes a simplified, high-level cost structure based on management-provided per-Boe (Barrel of Oil Equivalent) metrics.

*   **2025 Total Production (Midpoint):**
    *   Oil: 1.2 MMBbls
    *   NGL: 2.15 MMBbls
    *   Gas: $19.0 Bcf / 6 = 3.17 MMBoe (6:1 ratio)
    *   **Total Production:** 1.2 + 2.15 + 3.17 = **6.52 MMBoe** (or 17,863 Boepd)

**Cost Assumptions (Per-Boe Basis):**

| Cost Item | 2025 Assumption (Per Boe) | Justification/Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lease Operating Expense (LOE)** | $6.79 / Boe | Based on Q1 2025 LOE per Boe. |
| **Adjusted General & Admin (G&A)** | $1.74 / Boe | Based on 2023 Adjusted G&A per Boe. |
| **Total Per-Boe Operating Cost** | **$8.53 / Boe** | Sum of LOE and G&A. |

**Net Income Calculation (2025 - 2030):**

*   **Total Annual Operating Cost:** $8.53/Boe * 6.52 MMBoe = **$55.69 million** (Held constant 2025-2030).
*   **DD&A (Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization):** DD&A is a non-cash expense. Since the DCF model uses Net Income *as a proxy for cash flow* (as per the user's rule), a simplified approach is to exclude this from the "cash" component but acknowledge it for the tax calculation. However, the NOL shield simplifies the tax impact. For a conservative cash flow, I will *not* add back DD&A but will assume it is $0 for simplicity and to stay conservative, focusing on the cash-like income. A more rigorous approach would be to use Free Cash Flow, but the user explicitly requested Net Income.
*   **Interest Expense:** $0 (No debt).
*   **Income Tax Expense:** $\mathbf{0\%}$ Federal Tax Rate. The company has a substantial $\sim \$1.6$ billion Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward as of YE2023, which is expected to shield future free cash flow from federal income taxes for the entire forecast period.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Total Operating Cost (B) | Pre-Tax Income (C = A-B) | Tax (0%) (D) | **Net Income (E = C-D)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2026** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2027** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2028** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2029** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2030** | $203.2$ | $55.7$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |

*Net Income Margin: $147.5 / 203.2 = 72.6\%$. This high margin is primarily due to the low-cost structure, no debt, and the $0\%$ federal tax rate from the NOL.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### **ROIC and Cash Flow Calculation**

The rule is to assume Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year, and then an additional income is earned from a reasonable ROIC on the *accumulated cash*.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** The past ROIC was cited as 6.91%. Given the company's profitability and capital position, but to remain conservative, a **ROIC of 5.0%** is used for cash earnings. This assumes the company can conservatively invest its excess capital to earn a return.

| Year | Start of Year Cash (Accrued) | Net Income from Operations | ROIC on Start Cash (5.0%) | **Total Cash Flow (for DCF)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $0.0$ | $147.5$ | $0.0$ | **$147.5$** |
| **2026** | $147.5$ | $147.5$ | $7.4$ | **$154.9$** |
| **2027** | $147.5 + 154.9 = 302.4$ | $147.5$ | $15.1$ | **$162.6$** |
| **2028** | $302.4 + 162.6 = 465.0$ | $147.5$ | $23.3$ | **$170.8$** |
| **2029** | $465.0 + 170.8 = 635.8$ | $147.5$ | $31.8$ | **$179.3$** |
| **2030** | $635.8 + 179.3 = 815.1$ | $147.5$ | $40.8$ | **$188.3$** |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | |

*Note on Cash Accrual: This column shows the *cumulative* Net Income as a proxy for the cash that earns ROIC in the subsequent year.*

#### **Discount and Maturity Rates**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** The discount rate must be conservative (higher discount rate = lower NPV). For a small cap E&P company, a common WACC estimate is 8-12%. Given the zero-debt, highly flexible capital structure, a lower cost of capital might be argued, but to remain conservative, I will use an estimated WACC (Cost of Equity) of **11.0%**.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate, g):** A very conservative long-term growth rate must be used. For an E&P company with a declining asset base, assuming zero long-term growth is most conservative. I will use a conservative maturity rate of **$1.0\%$**. This assumes the company will grow *less* than the rate of inflation, which aligns with the "very conservative" rule.

#### **Terminal Value Calculation**

Terminal Value (TV) in 2030 = (Cash Flow in 2030 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)

$\text{TV}_{2030} = (\$188.3 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.01)) / (0.11 - 0.01)$
$\text{TV}_{2030} = (\$190.2 \text{ million}) / 0.10 = \mathbf{\$1,902.0 \text{ million}}$

#### **NPV Calculation**

| Year | Cash Flow | Discount Factor @ 11.0% | NPV of Cash Flow (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $147.5$ | $1 / (1.11)^1 = 0.901$ | $132.9$ |
| **2026** | $154.9$ | $1 / (1.11)^2 = 0.812$ | $125.7$ |
| **2027** | $162.6$ | $1 / (1.11)^3 = 0.731$ | $118.9$ |
| **2028** | $170.8$ | $1 / (1.11)^4 = 0.659$ | $112.6$ |
| **2029** | $179.3$ | $1 / (1.11)^5 = 0.593$ | $106.3$ |
| **2030 (Normal)** | $188.3$ | $1 / (1.11)^6 = 0.535$ | $100.8$ |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | $1,902.0$ | $1 / (1.11)^6 = 0.535$ | $1,017.6$ |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | $\mathbf{\$1,614.8 \text{ million}}$ |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

**Fair Value of Stock = (Total NPV + Initial Cash - Total Debt) / Shares Outstanding**

| Metric | Value (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV** | $1,614.8$ |
| **Initial Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $101.1$ |
| **Total Debt** | $0.0$ |
| **Equity Value** | $1,715.9$ |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $37.18$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\mathbf{\$46.15}$ |

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is $\mathbf{\$46.15}$**.

### Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Price | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\mathbf{\$46.15}$ | $\sim \$11.89$ | $\mathbf{288\%}$ |

**The fair value is $\mathbf{\$46.15}$, which is significantly higher (nearly 288% difference) than the current market price of approximately $\mathbf{\$11.89}$.**

#### **Why is the assumption so different from the market?**

The market is making a profoundly different assumption about SandRidge Energy (SD) than this conservative DCF model. The model's key assumptions that lead to a high valuation are:

1.  **Sustainable, High Net Income Margin:** The model projects an extremely high Net Income Margin of $\sim 72.6\%$ due to two major factors:
    *   **$\mathbf{0\%}$ Federal Tax Rate:** The company's $\sim \$1.6$ billion Net Operating Loss (NOL) shield effectively eliminates federal income tax for the entire forecast period. The market likely assigns a much higher future tax rate as it may price in the risk of the NOL being compromised, or a higher state tax, or a shorter life for the cash flows.
    *   **Ultra-Low Cost Structure and No Debt:** The low G&A and LOE per Boe combined with **zero debt** result in minimal non-production-related costs. The market may be skeptical that the company can maintain this low-cost structure, especially if M&A activities increase.

2.  **Conservative but High Cash Conversion (Net Income = Cash Flow):** The model is based on the rule that Net Income *is* cash flow, which is a very strong assumption, especially considering the lack of DD&A and Capital Expenditure subtraction (as DCF typically uses Free Cash Flow, which accounts for this). The high Net Income is a proxy for the substantial Free Cash Flow the company generates.
    *   **Market's Implicit Discount:** The market may be implicitly discounting the future cash flows for **significant capital expenditures (CAPEX)** necessary to simply keep the production flat and offset the single-digit decline. Management has been flexible with their capital program, but a long-term valuation must assume significant reinvestment to realize the terminal value. If I were to subtract an estimated \$50 million per year in maintenance CAPEX (which aligns with a recent Q3 2024 operating cash flow less free cash flow observation), the resulting NPV would be significantly lower, bringing the fair value closer to the market price.

3.  **Low Terminal Discount Rate (WACC - g):** The spread of $11.0\% - 1.0\% = 10\%$ is relatively low for a small-cap E&P company. The market may be pricing in a much higher risk, demanding a WACC of $15-20\%$ due to:
    *   **Commodity Price Volatility:** SD is highly exposed to volatile oil and gas prices. The market likely assumes a far more volatile or lower long-term average commodity price than the conservative $70 WTI / $3.50 HH used here.
    *   **Execution Risk:** The company's future value depends heavily on successful M&A and high-return organic projects to offset its core asset decline. The market may be applying a "show-me" discount until they see sustained, accretive execution.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The primary reason for the valuation being $\mathbf{\$46.15}$ compared to the market price of $\mathbf{\$11.89}$ is the strict application of the rules to use **Net Income as a proxy for cash flow** and the **$0\%$ federal tax rate from the NOL**. The market is highly skeptical of the permanence and quality of this Net Income, implicitly pricing in:

*   **Significant future CAPEX** to maintain production (which would turn Net Income into true Free Cash Flow).
*   **A much higher risk/discount rate** due to commodity volatility and execution risk.
*   **Skepticism on the long-term utility of the NOL** or a higher effective tax rate from state/other taxes.

The market value of $\mathbf{\$11.89}$ suggests a high degree of skepticism regarding the company's ability to maintain its high-margin cash flow without massive reinvestment.
