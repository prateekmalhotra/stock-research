### **2. Business Engine and Conservative Projections (2025–2030)**

HLT operates an asset-light model, where the vast majority of its profit comes from management and franchise fees. The core drivers of its revenue are:
$$ \text{Revenue Growth} \approx (1 + \text{System-wide RevPAR Growth}) \times (1 + \text{Net Unit Growth}) $$
Because the revenue is primarily fees on gross hotel performance, the margin is structurally high and should remain stable or slightly improve (non-conservatively), but we will hold it constant.

#### **Assumptions & Justification:**

| Metric | 2025 Assumption | 2026-2030 Trend | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System-wide RevPAR Growth** | 2.50% | Declines to 1.00% | HLT guides 2.0% - 3.0% for 2025. We use the mid-point and then conservatively step it down, reflecting potential macro slowdowns (e.g., in the U.S. and China) and a cautious outlook on price increases. |
| **Net Unit Growth (NUG)** | 6.50% | Declines to 4.00% | HLT guides 6.0% - 7.0% for 2025 and 6-7% for the next several years, backed by a strong, record-setting development pipeline. We use the mid-point for 2025 and then conservatively step it down, as a 6-7% rate is difficult to sustain indefinitely. |
| **Net Income Margin** | 13.77% | Constant | Held constant at the calculated FY 2024 margin (13.77%). This is a conservative assumption, as the high-margin, asset-light fee-based revenue component (which is the main driver of NUG and RevPAR) is growing faster than other, lower-margin revenue streams (owned/leased hotels), suggesting the margin should *increase*. Keeping it flat is a conservative floor. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | 15.00% | Constant | HLT's asset-light, capital-efficient model (high franchise/management fees, low CapEx) historically yields very high returns. Management states "meaningful free cash flow conversion, which we expect to be greater than 50% of adjusted EBITDA". A conservative 15.00% is used for the additional income generation, reflecting a very profitable business that is slightly below aggressive market expectations. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | 8.50% | Constant | A reasonable cost of capital for a mature, highly leveraged (Debt/\$11.3B) but very stable, profitable, and globally diversified travel and tourism company. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | 2.00% | Constant | A very conservative growth rate, slightly above long-term global inflation (used as a proxy for long-term GDP growth, or a perpetual growth rate for the entire business). |

#### **Projected Financials (in Millions USD)**

The net income is calculated as:
$$ \text{Revenue} = \text{Revenue}_{Y-1} \times (1 + \text{RevPAR Growth}) \times (1 + \text{NUG}) $$
$$ \text{Net Income}_{Operating} = \text{Revenue} \times \text{Net Income Margin} $$
$$ \text{Total Net Income} = \text{Net Income}_{Operating} + (\text{Previous Year's Cash} \times \text{ROIC}) $$

| Year | RevPAR Growth | NUG | Revenue | Net Income (Operating) | Cash from Prev. Year | ROIC Income (15.00%) | **Total Net Income** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | 2.70% | 7.30% | \$11,174 | \$1,539 | - | - | **\$1,539** |
| **2025** | 2.50% | 6.50% | \$12,028 | \$1,657 | \$1,539 | \$231 | **\$1,888** |
| **2026** | 2.00% | 6.00% | \$12,828 | \$1,767 | \$3,427 | \$514 | **\$2,281** |

### **3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The cash flow for valuation is assumed to be the **Total Net Income**, as Hilton's capital expenditures are relatively low (for an asset-light model) and are largely covered by the growth engine being primarily fee-based. This simplification is consistent with using "Net Income" as the cash flow metric per the user's rules.

#### **3.1. Net Present Value (NPV) of Forecast Period (2025–2030)**

| Year | Total Net Income | Discount Factor (8.50%) | **NPV of Cash Flow** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1,888 | 0.9217 | \$1,740 |
| **2026** | \$2,281 | 0.8495 | \$1,938 |
| **2027** | \$2,730 | 0.7830 | \$2,137 |
| **2028** | \$3,243 | 0.7217 | \$2,341 |
| **2029** | \$3,818 | 0.6652 | \$2,539 |
| **2030** | \$4,474 | 0.6131 | \$2,743 |
| **NPV of Forecast Period** | | | **\$13,438 million** |

#### **3.2. Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the value of all cash flows beyond the forecast period. We use the 2030 Total Net Income and the conservative 2.00% perpetual growth rate.
$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Terminal Growth Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Terminal Growth Rate}} $$
$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$4,474 \text{ M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.0850 - 0.0200} = \frac{\$4,563 \text{ M}}{0.0650} = \$70,200 \text{ million} $$

#### **3.3. Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value**
$$ \text{NPV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} $$
$$ \text{NPV of TV} = \$70,200 \text{ M} \times 0.6131 = \mathbf{\$43,043 \text{ million}} $$

#### **3.4. Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**
$$ \text{TEV} = \text{NPV of Forecast Period} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} $$
$$ \text{TEV} = \$13,438 \text{ M} + \$43,043 \text{ M} = \mathbf{\$56,481 \text{ million}} $$

### **4. Fair Value Calculation**

The final fair value of the stock is calculated by adjusting the Enterprise Value for cash and debt, then dividing by the shares outstanding.

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{TEV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

| Metric | Value (in Millions USD, except Shares/Price) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Enterprise Value (TEV) | \$56,481 |
| \+ Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$1,655 |
| \- Total Debt | \$11,300 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$46,836 million** |
| $\div$ Shares Outstanding | 243.8 million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$192.11** |

### **5. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value per Share (HLT):** **\$192.11**

*As of November 2025 (current context), the market value of HLT stock is approximately **\$260.00** (assumed, based on implied valuation from the provided SEC snippets).*

#### **Market Implied Assumptions vs. Conservative Model**

My calculated **Fair Value of \$192.11** is significantly lower than the market price of approximately \$260.00. The market appears to be making a significantly more optimistic assumption about the long-term cash flow generation of HLT than my conservative model allows.

The difference in valuation is primarily due to the following conservative assumptions:

1.  **Lower-for-Longer Growth in the Out-Years:** My model conservatively steps down the RevPAR growth to **1.00%** and the Net Unit Growth (NUG) to **4.00%** by 2030. The market is likely pricing in a longer tail of high-single-digit RevPAR (e.g., 3-4%) and/or NUG (e.g., 5-6%) growth, believing HLT's brand power, development pipeline (nearly 500,000 rooms), and global expansion will drive superior performance for an extended period. For instance, increasing the perpetual growth rate from **2.00%** to a more optimistic but still reasonable **3.00%** (i.e., higher than conservative global GDP/inflation) would raise the NPV of the Terminal Value significantly, closing the gap substantially.
2.  **Conservative ROIC & Net Income Margin:** I used a flat and conservative Net Income Margin of **13.77%** and a static ROIC of **15.00%**. Given that the high-margin management/franchise fee segment is the primary growth driver (with management/franchise fee revenues growing 10.7% for 9M 2024, significantly outpacing RevPAR), the actual net income margin is likely to *expand* over time. The market is likely forecasting margin expansion and a higher ROIC (closer to its historical peaks or the implied high FCF conversion) which would compound the Net Income projections quickly.
3.  **Conservative WACC:** An 8.50% discount rate is reasonable. However, due to HLT's highly predictable, fee-based cash flows (less cyclical than owned hotels), a lower WACC (e.g., 7.50% or 8.00%) might be justified by the market, as its cash flows are perceived as more bond-like in stability.

**Conclusion:** The market is valuing HLT as a premium, perpetual high-growth franchise business, capitalizing a higher sustained earnings stream and/or applying a lower discount rate to those earnings. My valuation is conservative, treating the long-term growth as moderating significantly after the initial five-year run-up. The **\$67.89** difference (\$260.00 - \$192.11) represents the value of this market optimism, suggesting the market believes the company will grow faster and longer than my prudent model.
