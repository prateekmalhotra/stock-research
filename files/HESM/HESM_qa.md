## Business Summary

Hess Midstream LP operates primarily as a utility service for energy producers in the Bakken and Three Forks areas of North Dakota. It is a business-to-business (B2B) operation, with its main customer being its parent company, Hess Corporation, although it also serves other drilling companies. The company's core business model is that of a fee-based 'toll road': it owns the infrastructure, such as pipelines and processing plants, necessary to gather and move raw crude oil, natural gas, and water from the drilling sites to refineries and markets. HESM generates stable revenue by charging fixed or volume-based fees for these services under long-term contracts, meaning its earnings are protected from the daily fluctuations in the market price of oil and gas.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk is vulnerability to volume fluctuation. While HESM is protected from oil price swings, if energy producers, especially its major customer Hess Corporation, reduce their drilling activity or temporarily shut down wells—as they did during the 2015 and 2020 oil price crashes—the volume of materials transported by HESM drops significantly, directly harming its earnings. A key long-term risk relates to geographic concentration; because the company operates almost exclusively in one specific region (the Bakken), any long-term regulatory changes in North Dakota governing pipeline construction or environmental impacts, or a permanent decline in the profitability of that region's energy reserves, could permanently restrict HESM’s market position and ability to grow.

### **Hess Midstream LP (HESM): A History from Inception to Present**

Hess Midstream LP is a critical infrastructure company in the energy sector, focused on moving and processing oil and gas. Its operations are centered in one of the most productive oil regions in the United States, the Bakken Shale in North Dakota.

#### **I. Inception and Founding Goal (Why it was Founded)**

1.  **Year and Structure:** Hess Midstream was initially formed in 2014 as a private joint venture, Hess Midstream Partners LP, by two large sponsors: Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP).
2.  **The Founding Problem (The Need):** Hess Corporation was dramatically increasing its oil and gas production in the Bakken, but it needed a reliable, dedicated system to handle all that output. Oil and gas coming out of the ground must be *gathered* from the well, *processed* to separate natural gas from oil and liquids, and then *transported* to market.
3.  **The Founding Solution/Goal:** The new company was founded to manage this vital infrastructure—the pipelines, the processing plants, and the terminals—allowing Hess Corporation to focus solely on drilling for oil and gas. This business model is known as a "midstream" company, sitting between the "upstream" producer (Hess) and the "downstream" refiner/user.
4.  **Business Model Cornerstone:** HESM was designed as a **fee-based** company, meaning its income is generated from the volume of oil and gas it handles, not from the fluctuating *price* of those commodities. This fee-based model is the foundation of its financial stability.

#### **II. Evolution and Key Milestones**

1.  **Public Market Access:** The company went public (Initial Public Offering or IPO) under the ticker HESM, which allowed it to raise significant capital from public investors. This money was essential to fund the massive, ongoing construction of pipelines and processing facilities needed to serve the growing Bakken production.
2.  **Asset Expansion:** A key focus has been the expansion of major facilities, such as the Tioga Gas Plant. Expanding capacity at these sites ensures that as Hess and other producers drill more wells, HESM can efficiently gather and process the increased volumes.
3.  **Corporate Simplification:** Over time, HESM underwent a corporate restructuring, consolidating its various internal partnership entities into a single, streamlined public company structure. This effort, often called "simplification," helped clarify its governance and financial reporting for investors.

#### **III. Problems Faced and Innovative Solutions**

1.  **Headwind: Industry Price Volatility:** The energy industry is notoriously volatile, with oil and gas prices swinging wildly (a major "headwind"). A traditional company would face major financial risk during a price crash, like the one in 2020.
2.  **Innovative Solution: Long-Term, Fee-Based Contracts:** HESM's ultimate innovative solution to this problem is its business model itself. It operates under long-term contracts with minimum volume commitments from Hess Corporation, often extending far into the future (like 2033). This means Hess must pay HESM a fee for a minimum amount of volume even if oil prices drop and production slows, guaranteeing stable revenue and insulating HESM from commodity price risk.
3.  **Headwind: High Capital Costs:** Building an extensive network of pipelines, compressors, and processing plants in a remote area like North Dakota requires billions of dollars (a continuous challenge).
4.  **Solution: Strategic Funding and Partnership:** The initial joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and the later IPO were strategic moves to pool the necessary capital. The stable, predictable fee-based cash flows also make HESM an attractive investment, enabling it to borrow money and fund its infrastructure growth.
5.  **Headwind: Keeping Pace with the Boom:** The Bakken region saw production skyrocket, requiring infrastructure to be built quickly and efficiently to avoid bottlenecks (a problem where oil can't get to market).
6.  **Solution: Integrated Asset Base:** HESM built a fully integrated system—a one-stop-shop for oil, gas, and water handling. This comprehensive network allows for efficient, seamless service from the wellhead all the way to the market, which is a major competitive advantage in the region.

#### **IV. Tailwinds and Current Context**

1.  **Tailwind: Anchor Customer and Dedicated Volumes:** HESM's single biggest tailwind is its close relationship with Hess Corporation, the dominant producer in its operating area. This relationship provides HESM with a reliable, long-term stream of oil and gas volumes that will keep its pipelines full and revenue stable for many years.
2.  **Tailwind: Continued Bakken Production:** The geological success and steady drilling activity in the Bakken Shale provide a continuous supply of raw product that needs to be moved and processed. As long as the Bakken remains a key U.S. oil field, HESM’s services will be in demand.
3.  **Current Headwind: Corporate Change:** The biggest recent headwind is the announced acquisition of its primary sponsor, Hess Corporation, by Chevron. HESM must navigate this major change, although it is currently expected to remain a publicly traded, separate company with its contracts intact.
4.  **Goal for the Future:** HESM continues to focus on expansion, with plans for new infrastructure like a gas processing plant coming online in the coming years. Its goal is to continue growing its volumes and generating stable cash flows to consistently increase the cash distributions it returns to its investors.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Hess Midstream LP (HESM) is a combination of its physical, irreplaceable infrastructure and its unique, iron-clad commercial agreements.

### Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Sponsor Relationship (The Core Moat):** HESM's primary competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Hess Corporation, which is both a sponsor and its anchor customer, providing substantial revenue. This differentiates it from competitors who have to rely solely on open-market contracts.
2.  **Long-Term, Sticky Contracts:** The vast majority of HESM’s revenue comes from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Hess Corporation, which extend through 2033. These contracts are highly recurring and provide exceptional stability.
3.  **Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs):** The contracts are underpinned by Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs), which legally obligate the customer (Hess Corporation) to pay for a certain minimum amount of volume, whether they use the services or not. This provides strong downside protection and cash flow stability.
4.  **Integrated Infrastructure as a Barrier to Entry:** HESM owns a comprehensive, integrated network of gathering pipelines, processing facilities, and terminals strategically located in the core of the Bakken Shale play. This is not a service that can be easily duplicated, as constructing a similar interconnected system requires massive capital and time.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Contractual Pricing Power:** HESM has a special position because its long-term contracts include **annual inflation escalators**. This feature automatically allows the company to raise its service fees over time, giving it a built-in degree of pricing power that helps offset rising operating costs.
2.  **Specialized Market Position:** The company operates as a dominant player within its specific Bakken footprint, acting as a dedicated utility for one of the basin’s largest producers (Hess Corporation). This ensures it captures significant production volumes before they are available to other midstream providers.
3.  **End-to-End Service Advantage:** The integrated nature of its assets allows it to offer a diversified, end-to-end service for crude oil, natural gas, and water. This allows customers to receive attractive netback pricing and access to multiple market export options, making its service highly valuable and hard to swap for a competitor's less-integrated system.

### Growth, Displacement, and Innovation

1.  **Reason for Growth:** HESM grew into what it is today because it was initially established as a dedicated joint venture by Hess Corporation (HES) and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) to develop the necessary infrastructure to support HES's large-scale, significant oil and gas production in the Bakken. The growth has been organic, fueled by continuous investment to capture the increasing volumes from Hess’s drilling activity.
2.  **Displacement Difficulty:** The company is difficult to displace by someone with more capital because the moat is not just the physical capital (pipelines, plants, etc.) but the **pre-existing long-term contracts and dedications**. A competitor would have to build an equally extensive network *and* somehow convince Hess Corporation to breach or replace its long-term MVC contracts, which is highly unlikely and costly.
3.  **Low R&D, High Efficiency Focus:** Midstream companies do not require constant, groundbreaking innovation like a technology firm. Its focus on innovation is centered on operational efficiency, such as using **Real-Time Data Analytics** for predictive maintenance and **Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) Programs** for environmental compliance. This ensures reliable and safe operations, which is the key to maintaining its competitive edge.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of management incentive and compensation for Hess Midstream LP (HESM) reveals a complex structure due to its relationship with its parent company, Hess Corporation (Hess).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Unique Compensation Structure (Key Factor):** The Named Executive Officers (NEOs) of HESM are primarily compensated by **Hess Corporation**, and their salary, bonus, and main equity awards are generally set under Hess's compensation programs, not HESM's.
2.  **HESM-Specific Incentives (LTIP):** The only HESM-specific compensation is typically from the **Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)**, which grants awards like Phantom Units.
3.  **Direct Shareholder Alignment in LTIP:** The Phantom Units are granted with tandem **Distribution Equivalent Rights (DERs)**, which provide the executive with payments equal to the cash distributions (dividends) paid on an HESM unit. This feature directly links a portion of the executive's pay to HESM's key shareholder return metric (distributions).
4.  **Performance Metrics:** The LTIP's financial performance targets often rely on non-GAAP measures such as **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Distributable Cash Flow (DCF)**, which are directly related to HESM's operational health and ability to sustain and grow distributions for shareholders.
5.  **Individual Insider Ownership:** Individual executive and director ownership in HESM is generally low to moderate (e.g., the CEO directly owns approximately 0.046% of the company's shares). Higher individual ownership by managers and directors is typically considered a stronger alignment signal.
6.  **Corporate/Institutional Insider Ownership (Crucial Alignment):** Overall "insider" ownership is extremely high, with major sponsors and corporate parents, specifically **GIP II Blue Holding LP (88.21%)** and **Hess Corporation (76.03%)**, holding a substantial majority of the units. This strong alignment by the corporate owners—who control the board and executive appointments—mitigates the impact of low individual executive ownership.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

1.  **Incentive Alignment is Strong at the Corporate Level:** The management's ultimate control is by Hess Corporation and GIP, who together own the vast majority of HESM units. Their incentive is overwhelmingly aligned with long-term shareholder value creation for HESM, as they are the company's largest shareholders.
2.  **Incentive Alignment is Mixed at the Individual Level:** The bulk of an executive's pay is tied to the performance of the parent company, Hess Corporation, which could distract from purely HESM-focused decisions. However, the HESM-specific LTIP, through its use of Distribution Equivalent Rights and metrics like DCF, provides a clear and direct financial incentive for the executive to act in the interest of HESM unitholders by growing distributions and underlying cash flow.
3.  **Overall Conclusion:** Management has **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of shareholders** due to the dominant ownership stake of the corporate sponsors/parents and the structure of the LTIP, which ties the only HESM-specific compensation directly to cash distributions and fundamental midstream financial metrics. The risk of managers only "lining their own pockets" is low, as the primary source of personal enrichment from HESM would be via the LTIP, whose value is derived from the same financial performance that benefits all unitholders.

## Long Thesis

Hess Midstream is a highly stable infrastructure utility that acts like a toll road for oil and gas production in the Bakken region. The bull case rests on its guaranteed cash flow, its massive growth potential tied to its primary customer (now Chevron), and its dedication to returning cash to shareholders. In the near term, the company expects about 10% volume growth in 2025 as Chevron increases drilling. This growth is secured by strong, long-term contracts that require customers to pay fees even if they don't use the minimum capacity (Minimum Volume Commitments). This structure fully protects HESM from commodity price crashes. Long-term, HESM promises to consistently raise its cash distributions (dividends) by 5% annually and use significant financial flexibility to buy back shares, making it an excellent investment for predictable income and capital appreciation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that the new corporate sponsor, Chevron, will honor and adhere to the long-term, binding contracts (through 2033) that guarantee Hess Midstream stable revenue. We must also assume that Chevron follows through on its public commitment to significantly increase oil and gas production in the Bakken region, thereby delivering the projected 10% volume growth and continued expansion beyond 2025. Finally, management must maintain its commitment to capital return by consistently executing the promised 5% annual distribution increases and utilizing free cash flow for aggressive share repurchases.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws in the long thesis, primarily centered on the change in sponsorship and the resulting shift in operational guidance.

### Bear Case Thesis: **A Yield Stock, Not a Growth Utility, with Material Sponsor Uncertainty**

Hess Midstream's valuation is at risk because the "growth" component of the bull case has been severely compromised by its new sponsor, Chevron. The company is transitioning from a high-growth infrastructure utility into a stable, high-yield vehicle with limited near-term expansion potential. The expected lower capital intensity by Chevron will lead to flat EBITDA growth, and the long-term risk of Chevron divesting the entire Bakken asset package introduces significant uncertainty about the future of the core customer relationship after 2033.

***

### Flaws and Faults in the Bull Thesis

1.  **Challenged Growth Assumption from New Sponsor:** The core assumption of "significantly increase oil and gas production" is directly contradicted by Hess Midstream's updated guidance, which anticipates Chevron reducing Bakken rig activity from four to three, starting in late 2025.
2.  **Flat Near-Term Financial Outlook:** As a consequence of the lower planned rig activity, the company expects its oil throughput volumes to **plateau in 2026** and projects **relatively flat Adjusted EBITDA** in 2026 compared to 2025, which undermines the thesis's claim of "massive growth potential."
3.  **Growth-to-Yield Strategy Pivot:** The "aggressive share repurchases" and stable 5% distribution growth are now primarily funded by *reduced* future capital expenditures, including the suspension of a major expansion project (the Capa gas plant). This suggests management is pivoting from a growth strategy to a yield-focused strategy, which warrants a lower valuation multiple than a "growth utility."
4.  **Future Sponsor Uncertainty:** While Chevron is honoring the current long-term contracts (extended through 2033), Chevron has publicly guided to $10–$15 billion in asset divestments by 2028, fueling speculation that the non-core Bakken assets could eventually be sold. This uncertainty introduces risk around the new sponsor's long-term commitment to the region.
5.  **Contract-Based Stability is Not Growth:** The thesis overemphasizes the downside protection from Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs). While MVCs through 2033 guarantee a high level of **stable revenue** (80% of nomination), they only ensure a floor for cash flow, not the volume expansion necessary to justify a premium growth valuation.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis reveals a core contradiction between the old and updated guidance regarding future growth. The initial search results help reconcile the "growth" vs. "flat" debate and confirm the financial strength metrics.

Here are the next steps to investigate, focusing on the unresolved strategic and contractual risks following the Chevron merger:

### **Important Questions Still Left Unanswered**

1.  **Contractual Assignment Risk (The Long-Term Sponsor Moat):**
    *   The largest long-term risk is the potential divestment of the Bakken assets by Chevron.
    *   **Investigate:** Search HESM's recent SEC filings (e.g., 8-K or 10-Q) for the exact language on the **"assignment" or "change of control"** clauses in the commercial agreements. This will determine if the long-term Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs) can be automatically transferred to a new, potentially less committed Bakken buyer, or if the contract with the new entity would need to be renegotiated.

2.  **Reconciling Growth Guidance and Capital Strategy:**
    *   The bear case cited flat EBITDA in 2026, while earlier guidance projected 10% growth in 2026. The most recent September 2025 update confirms that oil volumes will **plateau in 2026** due to Chevron reducing the rig count, leading to **relatively flat Adjusted EBITDA** in 2026 versus 2025.
    *   **Investigate:** Search management commentary or analyst reports from the September 2025 guidance update (the one detailing the rig reduction) to understand *why* the reduction in capital spending (suspension of the Capa gas plant) and the plateau in oil throughput is considered a positive for the stock (i.e., less capital intensity, more free cash flow).

3.  **Distribution Sustainability vs. Flat EBITDA (Yield Coverage):**
    *   Management targets a 5% annual distribution increase through 2027 and expects to generate strong Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF) growth through 2027, despite the flat 2026 EBITDA.
    *   **Investigate:** Reconcile the Distribution Coverage Ratio. The search indicated a ratio of around $1.5x in 2023, expected to be "at least 1.4x" through 2025. Search for the **most recently projected Distribution Coverage Ratio for 2026 and 2027** to ensure the 5% growth is comfortably funded by cash flow (i.e., it is not relying on the inflation escalator alone or increasing debt).

4.  **Peer Valuation and Market Perception:**
    *   The company is shifting to a "yield stock" funded by reduced CapEx.
    *   **Investigate:** Perform a detailed comparison of HESM's valuation (specifically the EV/EBITDA multiple and Forward Yield) against a peer group of midstream companies (MLPs) that are also primarily in **"harvest" or "yield"** mode, not high-growth mode. This will determine if the market has correctly re-rated HESM from a growth stock to a yield stock.

5.  **Role of Non-Affiliate Volumes (Third-Party Growth):**
    *   The search noted that gas growth is supported by Hess *and* additional third-party volumes. Since Chevron's commitment (the affiliate) is decreasing (lower rig count), the reliance on third-party volumes becomes more critical.
    *   **Investigate:** Quantify the current and projected growth from non-affiliate/third-party volumes. Search for any public commentary from management about their strategy to attract third-party customers now that the primary anchor customer is reducing its drilling pace.
