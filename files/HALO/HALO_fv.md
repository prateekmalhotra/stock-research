## II. Business Engine Analysis & Future Projections

Halozyme's core business engine is its high-margin **ENHANZE** drug delivery technology, which facilitates the subcutaneous (SC) delivery of drugs, converting complex intravenous (IV) infusions into simpler, faster SC injections. The company operates predominantly on a royalty-based model, which drives exceptional margins and predictable cash flows.

**Key Growth Drivers & Durability:**

1.  **Blockbuster Royalties:** The main revenue source is royalty payments from three established blockbuster SC therapies: **DARZALEX SC**, **Phesgo**, and **VYVGART Hytrulo**. VYVGART Hytrulo is cited as the largest royalty dollar growth driver.
2.  **IP Longevity:** Management confirms that key royalty streams have significant durability: DARZALEX SC royalties continue through 2032, and other products like OCREVUS Zunovo, Tecentriq Hybreza, and Opdivo Qvantig are projected to earn royalties into the 2030s and 2040s. A new European patent for ENHANZE also extended the full royalty rate for DARZALEX SC in Europe until March 2029.
3.  **Pipeline Expansion:** The portfolio is expanding with new product approvals, geographic expansions, and the recent October 2025 acquisition of **Elektrofi** (Hypercon™ technology), which provides ultra-high concentration SC delivery and is expected to drive long-term growth into the 2040s.

### A. Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Management's 2025 full-year guidance for Total Revenue is \$1,300 million to \$1,375 million. I will use the midpoint of **\$1,337.5 million** for 2025.

The key to future growth is the high-margin royalty revenue, which is projected to grow 49% to 54% in 2025. Due to the high-quality, high-durability, and royalty-based nature of the revenue stream, a conservative annual growth rate is justified.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Revenue Growth Rate Assumption | Justification for Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,337.5 | 31.5% (Midpoint of 28%-35% guidance) | Management Guidance. |
| **2026** | $1,578.2 | 18.0% | Conservative reduction from 2025, reflecting continued growth from VYVGART Hytrulo ramp, new launches (Ocrevus, Tecentriq), and the initial impact of the Elektrofi acquisition. |
| **2027** | $1,736.0 | 10.0% | Maturation of the three main blockbusters and a solid contribution from the Wave 3 launches. |
| **2028** | $1,840.2 | 6.0% | Decelerating growth as key ENHANZE products mature, but still positive due to long-term IP durability. |
| **2029** | $1,904.8 | 3.5% | Further conservative slowdown, approaching terminal rate. |
| **2030** | $1,942.9 | 2.0% | Approaching the conservative terminal growth rate. |

### B. Net Income Margin & ROIC Projections

**Net Income Margin:** Halozyme is a high-margin business driven by royalties. Q3 2025 GAAP Net Income was $175.2 million on Total Revenue of $354.3 million, yielding a 49.4% margin.
*   **Conservative Assumption:** I will use a **45.0% Net Income Margin** for all projection years. This is below the current run-rate, which is a conservative approach.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The net income for each year is assumed to go straight into cash, forming the base for the next year's invested capital.
*   **Conservative Assumption:** A low, conservative ROIC of **3.0%** will be used for the calculation of additional income from the accumulated cash (Net Income from the previous year). Since the company is profitable, a positive but conservative rate is appropriate.

**Net Income Calculation:** Net Income (t) = (Revenue (t) * Net Income Margin) + (Net Income (t-1) * ROIC)

| Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | NI (Base) | NI (from ROIC) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,337.5 | 45.0% | $601.9 | $0.0 | **$601.9** |
| **2026** | $1,578.2 | 45.0% | $710.2 | $18.1 | **$728.3** |
| **2027** | $1,736.0 | 45.0% | $781.2 | $21.9 | **$803.1** |
| **2028** | $1,840.2 | 45.0% | $828.1 | $24.1 | **$852.2** |
| **2029** | $1,904.8 | 45.0% | $857.2 | $25.6 | **$882.8** |
| **2030** | $1,942.9 | 45.0% | $874.3 | $26.5 | **$900.8** |

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%** is selected. This is a conservative WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) for a profitable, high-growth, royalty-driven biotech company with proven commercial products.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **1.5%** is selected. This is a conservative perpetual growth rate, reflecting the long-term, high-durability nature of the ENHANZE royalties (some into the 2040s) and the growth potential from the new Elektrofi platform.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**
$$TV = Cash Flow_{2030} * \frac{(1 + Maturity Rate)}{(Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)}$$
$$TV = \$900.8 * \frac{(1 + 0.015)}{(0.09 - 0.015)}$$
$$TV = \$900.8 * \frac{1.015}{0.075}$$
$$TV = \$900.8 * 13.533 = **\$12,189.5 million**$$

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (NI) | Discount Factor | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=1) | $601.9 | 0.9174 | $552.1 |
| **2026** (t=2) | $728.3 | 0.8417 | $613.1 |
| **2027** (t=3) | $803.1 | 0.7722 | $620.3 |
| **2028** (t=4) | $852.2 | 0.7084 | $603.8 |
| **2029** (t=5) | $882.8 | 0.6499 | $573.7 |
| **2030** (t=6) | $900.8 | 0.5963 | $537.4 |
| **Terminal Value** (t=6) | $12,189.5 | 0.5963 | $7,272.9 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$10,773.3 million** |

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value of Equity** = NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Liquid Cash - Total Debt

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$10,773.3 + \$701.963 - \$2,810.757 = **\$8,664.5 million**$$

**Fair Value per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Diluted Shares Outstanding

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$8,664.5 \text{ million} / 122.331 \text{ million shares} = **\$70.83**$$

---

## V. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of HALO Stock: **$70.83**

### Comparison to Market Value and Justification

The fair value calculated is **\$70.83 per share**.

*   *Note: As of the time of this analysis (November 2025), the current market price for HALO stock is not provided, but for comparison, we assume a historical-based price of approximately \$45.00 to illustrate the difference.*

If the current market value of HALO stock is significantly lower (e.g., in the \$45-\$55 range), the calculated fair value of **\$70.83** suggests the stock is undervalued.

**Justification for the Fair Value (Why my assumption is different from the market):**

My valuation is driven by Halozyme's unique, high-margin, durable royalty business model, and my model is conservative on growth but aggressive on the longevity of the cash flow. The market may be making different, more conservative assumptions in a few key areas:

1.  **Discounting the Long-Term Durability of Royalty Income:** My model's intrinsic value is heavily influenced by the Terminal Value of **$12.2 billion**, which is justified by management's commentary on the ENHANZE intellectual property extending into the **2030s and 2040s** (Tecentriq Hybreza, Opdivo Qvantig) and the potential of the new Elektrofi platform. The market may be excessively discounting these long-dated cash flows or assuming a higher risk to the patent life, which would necessitate a higher Discount Rate or a lower Maturity Rate. My conservative Discount Rate of **9.0%** (for a high-margin, profitable biotech with recurring revenue) and Maturity Rate of **1.5%** are based on the expectation that these cash flows are highly durable.
2.  **Impact of New Debt vs. Cash Proceeds:** My valuation conservatively added the full **\$1.3 billion** in new convertible notes to the debt without offsetting the cash proceeds from the offering (as a post-Q3 event). If the market has accurately factored in the net positive impact of this financing (if proceeds are used for accretive investments or share buybacks), the net debt figure would be lower, resulting in an even *higher* fair value.
3.  **Conservative Margin Assumption:** I used a conservative Net Income Margin of **45.0%**, which is below the current quarterly run-rate (49.4% in Q3 2025). The high-margin royalty component is growing faster than the product sales component, which should lead to margin *expansion* over time. If the margin expands to 50-55% as the business matures, the fair value would increase significantly.
4.  **"Show Me" Risk in the Pipeline:** The market may be applying a substantial "show me" discount to the future contributions of new ENHANZE launches and the Elektrofi Hypercon™ technology, despite management's confidence and progress. My model incorporates a moderate, decelerating revenue growth which is primarily driven by the currently approved blockbusters, but the new acquisitions and pipeline programs provide a tangible, long-term floor for the perpetual growth rate.

**The market's implied assumptions, which differ from this model, are likely a combination of a higher perceived risk (higher discount rate) and a more skeptical view on the duration and/or growth of the royalty cash flows post-2030 (lower maturity rate).**
