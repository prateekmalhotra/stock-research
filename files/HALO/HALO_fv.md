## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Halozyme's business engine is overwhelmingly driven by **high-margin royalty revenue** from its proprietary **ENHANZE®** drug delivery technology. This technology enables the subcutaneous (SC) administration of biologics, converting lengthy intravenous (IV) infusions into quick SC injections, which is highly valuable to partners and patients.

The current core growth drivers are the three established blockbuster ENHANZE-enabled therapies: **DARZALEX SC**, **Phesgo**, and **VYVGART Hytrulo**. An additional four products (*Ocrevus Zunuvo, Tecentriq Hybreza, Opdivo Qvantig, Rybrevant SC*) are projected to contribute "meaningfully from 2026 onwards."

### Revenue Projections Justification:

1.  **2025 Revenue:** Based on the raised 2025 financial guidance from Q3 2025 earnings call. We will use the midpoint of **$1,337.5 million** (midpoint of $1,300M - $1,375M).
2.  **2026 - 2028 Revenue Growth (De-risked Growth Phase):** This period is expected to benefit from the full uptake of the current three blockbusters, the accelerating contribution from the next wave of four launched products, and the initial contributions from the remaining pipeline.
    *   **Assumption:** We assume a conservative, yet robust, deceleration from the 2025 guided growth (28%-35% over 2024). We model a step-down approach as the initial market penetration slows down.
        *   **2026:** **18.0%** growth (Slightly less than the low-end of 2025 guidance growth over 2024).
        *   **2027:** **15.0%** growth.
        *   **2028:** **12.0%** growth.
3.  **2029 - 2030 Revenue Growth (Patent Expiration & Mature Phase):** The European ENHANZE® patent for the rHuPH20 product is noted to expire in March 2029. This is a critical risk.
    *   **Assumption:** We assume a significant slowdown in growth to reflect the potential of European generic competition (biosimilars) after 2029, partially offset by US and other international market growth, and the company's efforts to extend durability (e.g., new rHuPH20 with patent protection to 2032 in Europe and 2034 in the US).
        *   **2029:** **8.0%** growth.
        *   **2030:** **5.0%** growth.

| Year | Revenue (in millions USD) | YoY Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | **$1,015.0** | *Actual* | Full Year 2024 Revenue. |
| **2025 (Projected)** | **$1,337.5** | 31.8% | Midpoint of 2025 Guidance ($1,300M - $1,375M). |
| **2026 (Projected)** | **$1,578.2** | 18.0% | Decelerating growth from accelerated product uptake. |
| **2027 (Projected)** | **$1,814.9** | 15.0% | Continued significant growth from new product launches. |
| **2028 (Projected)** | **$2,032.7** | 12.0% | Pre-patent expiration strong growth. |
| **2029 (Projected)** | **$2,195.3** | 8.0% | Slowdown due to European patent expiration risk (March 2029). |
| **2030 (Projected)** | **$2,305.1** | 5.0% | US market durability and new programs offset international patent headwinds. |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

The business is characterized by extremely high margins due to the royalty-heavy revenue model. Royalties carry minimal cost of goods sold (COGS).

### Margin Assumptions:

*   **Net Income Margin:** Historical Net Profit Margin (2023) was 43.74%. We use the following conservative, slightly increasing, but below-peak projection to allow for future investment and amortization costs.
    *   **2025:** **45.0%** (Based on 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $910M, which implies an approximate net income margin, and being conservative relative to its high-margin model).
    *   **2026 - 2030:** **46.0%** - This assumes continued operational efficiency and high-margin royalty growth, slightly offset by R&D/SG&A for pipeline and business expansion (like the Elektrofi acquisition).

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:

*   The average trailing twelve-month (TTM) ROIC is very high, ranging from 34.64% to 46.90%.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** We will assume a highly conservative and sustainable **15.0%** ROIC. This is a very conservative assumption compared to the company's historical performance, reflecting a lower-risk profile for re-invested cash.

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A * B) (C) | ROIC on Previous Cash (D) | Total Net Income (C + D) (E) | Previous Year's Cash (F) | ROIC % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,337.5 | 45.0% | $601.9 | - | **$601.9** | $702.0 | - |
| **2026** | $1,578.2 | 46.0% | $725.0 | $90.3 | **$815.3** | $601.9 | 15.0% |
| **2027** | $1,814.9 | 46.0% | $834.8 | $122.3 | **$957.1** | $815.3 | 15.0% |
| **2028** | $2,032.7 | 46.0% | $935.1 | $143.6 | **$1,078.7** | $957.1 | 15.0% |
| **2029** | $2,195.3 | 46.0% | $1,009.8 | $161.8 | **$1,171.6** | $1,078.7 | 15.0% |
| **2030** | $2,305.1 | 46.0% | $1,060.3 | $175.7 | **$1,236.0** | $1,171.6 | 15.0% |
| *Notes: Net Income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year for the purposes of the ROIC calculation.* |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **8.0%**. A conservative rate reflecting the company's strong profitability, high gross margins, and de-risked revenue stream from major pharmaceutical partnerships. A higher rate would be used for less profitable/more speculative biotechs.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate - Very Conservative):** **2.0%**. This is a very conservative rate, slightly above long-term inflation, assuming the core ENHANZE® franchise can maintain modest growth even after key patent expirations (2029) due to a durable portfolio, new pipeline products (e.g., from the Elektrofi acquisition), and a strong market position.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $815.3 | 0.9259 | $754.7 |
| **2027** | $957.1 | 0.8573 | $820.7 |
| **2028** | $1,078.7 | 0.7938 | $856.1 |
| **2029** | $1,171.6 | 0.7350 | $861.4 |
| **2030** | $1,236.0 | 0.6806 | $841.2 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | $1,236.0 * (1.02 / (0.08 - 0.02)) = $20,912.0M | 0.6806 | $14,233.1 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (2026-Terminal)** | | | **$18,367.2** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $18,367.2 |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents** | $702.0 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $1,300.0 |
| **Implied Equity Value** | **$17,769.2** |
| **Outstanding Shares** | 117.6 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $17,769.2M / 117.6M shares |
| **Fair Value Per Share (HALO)** | **$151.10** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$68.39** |

## 6. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value Per Share: $151.10**
**Current Stock Price: ~$68.39**

Our calculated fair value of **$151.10** is significantly higher (over 120% premium) than the current market price of approximately $68.39. This major discrepancy is a result of the market and our valuation making fundamentally different assumptions, primarily around the **durability and defensibility of the ENHANZE® royalty stream** against future patent challenges and expiration.

### Justification of Discrepancy: Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions

| Market Assumption (Pessimistic) | Valuation Assumption (Conservative/Management Guided) | Justification for Valuation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Patent Cliff Risk is High** | **Patent Durability is High/Mitigated** | Halozyme's business model is backed by multiple patent layers, including the European patent (expiring 2029) and new, extended-life rHuPH20 products (patented to 2032/2034). The market is likely pricing in a severe drop in royalty revenue starting in 2029. Our model assumes a *slowdown* (5.0% growth) but not a cliff, reflecting the company's mitigation strategies and new products. |
| **Low Future Growth** | **High Near-Term Growth** | The market is discounting the guidance that new products (*Ocrevus Zunuvo*, *Tecentriq Hybreza*, etc.) will grow "meaningfully from 2026 onwards." Our model assumes 12-18% growth in the 2026-2028 period due to new product launch momentum. |
| **Low Cash Conversion/Profitability** | **High and Stable Margins** | The market might fear that high R&D/SG&A or licensing changes will compress Halozyme's margins. Our model assumes a robust **46.0% Net Income Margin**, reflecting the inherently high-margin, asset-light royalty business model. |
| **Low Reinvestment Returns** | **High but Conservative ROIC** | The market may be assuming the company's reinvestments (like the Elektrofi acquisition) will not yield high returns. Our model uses an extremely conservative **15.0% ROIC** compared to the historical TTM ROIC of 34-46%, which still generates substantial value. |
| **High Cost of Capital** | **Reasonable Cost of Capital** | The market may be using a higher Discount Rate (e.g., 10-12%) due to the biotech sector and patent risk. Our model uses a conservative but justifiable **8.0%** rate, reflecting the de-risked, recurring cash flow stream from creditworthy mega-cap partners (Janssen, Roche, etc.). |

**Conclusion:** Our intrinsic valuation suggests that the market is severely undervaluing Halozyme's durable royalty engine, likely overstating the risk of the patent cliff in 2029 and under-appreciating the compounding effect of the new wave of ENHANZE® product launches. The company's actions, such as the debt refinancing to extend maturity and the strong guidance, support a higher valuation than the current price.
