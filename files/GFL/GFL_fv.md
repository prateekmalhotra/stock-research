### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)**

The core business engine for GFL is **Solid Waste Management**, which is driven by two key components: **Price** and **Volume/M&A**.

#### **Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Price Growth (P):** Management is guiding for **over 5.5%** pricing for the full year 2025. This is above inflation and reflects the non-cyclical, essential nature of the service. *Conservative Assumption:* Price growth will moderate over time.
    *   2025: 5.5% (Management Guide)
    *   2026-2027: 4.5% (Moderating from guide)
    *   2028-2030: 3.5% (Long-term stability above inflation)
2.  **Volume/Organic Growth (V):** Q2 2025 volume growth accelerated to 150 basis points sequentially. *Conservative Assumption:* Volume growth will average **1.0%** per year, reflecting a stable economy and market share gains, but being conservative about the acceleration trend.
3.  **Tuck-in M&A Growth (M):** Management has a $700-$900 million M&A deployment target for 2025 and an expectation to add **5%-7%** to annual EBITDA growth through tuck-in acquisitions. The focus post-divestiture is on the solid waste business. *Conservative Assumption:* I will conservatively assume a **3.0%** revenue growth contribution from M&A each year, lower than the implied EBITDA growth contribution to account for execution risk and integration costs.
4.  **Total Organic Growth (P+V):** This is the key driver of the core business.

### **3. Margin and Net Income Projection**

#### **Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Management is guiding for an **industry-leading 100 basis points (1.0%)** of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for 2025. The consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for 2025 is guided to be **29.7%**.
    *   I will assume this margin expansion continues for the near term as a result of operational efficiencies and fleet conversion.
    *   2025: 29.7% (Management Guide)
    *   2026: 30.7% (100 bps expansion)
    *   2027: 31.7% (100 bps expansion)
    *   2028-2030: 32.0% (Conservative stabilization at a higher, but capped, level)
2.  **Conversion to Net Income:** Given GFL's highly leveraged nature, interest and depreciation/amortization (D&A) expenses are high.
    *   **D&A / Revenue:** I will use a conservative fixed percentage of Revenue, based on historical norms, to cover D&A and other non-operating expenses: **15.0%**.
    *   **Interest Expense / Revenue:** With high debt ($5.29B), interest expense is significant. I will use a conservative fixed percentage of Revenue: **6.0%**.
    *   **Tax Rate:** A conservative and reasonable tax rate of **25.0%** will be applied to pre-tax income.

#### **Projected Net Income Calculation (in Millions USD):**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Adj. EBITDA Margin | Adj. EBITDA | D&A/Other (15.0%) | Interest Exp. (6.0%) | Pre-Tax Income | Tax (25.0%) | Net Income (NI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $6,493.4 | 29.7% | $1,928.1 | $974.0 | $389.6 | $564.5 | $141.1 | **$423.4** |
| **2026** | $7,045.3 | 30.7% | $2,162.9 | $1,056.8 | $422.7 | $683.4 | $170.8 | **$512.6** |
| **2027** | $7,644.0 | 31.7% | $2,423.0 | $1,146.6 | $458.6 | $817.8 | $204.5 | **$613.4** |
| **2028** | $8,217.3 | 32.0% | $2,629.5 | $1,232.6 | $493.0 | $903.9 | $226.0 | **$677.9** |
| **2029** | $8,833.6 | 32.0% | $2,826.7 | $1,325.0 | $530.0 | $971.7 | $242.9 | **$728.8** |
| **2030** | $9,495.1 | 32.0% | $3,038.4 | $1,424.3 | $569.7 | $1,044.4 | $261.1 | **$783.3** |

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The Net Income (NI) is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year. Additional income is generated from the accumulation of cash via a conservative ROIC of **3.0%**.

| Year | Net Income (NI) | PV of NI (@ 9.0% disc.) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $423.4 | $388.4 | |
| **2026** | $512.6 + $12.7* = **$525.3** | $442.2 | *Additional income from $423.4M x 3.0% ROIC* |
| **2027** | $613.4 + $28.5* = **$641.9** | $495.5 | *Additional income from ($423.4M + $512.6M) x 3.0% ROIC* |
| **2028** | $677.9 + $47.7* = **$725.6** | $514.0 | *Additional income from ($423.4M + $512.6M + $613.4M) x 3.0% ROIC* |
| **2029** | $728.8 + $70.0* = **$798.8** | $504.9 | *Additional income from ($423.4M + $512.6M + $613.4M + $677.9M) x 3.0% ROIC* |
| **2030** | $783.3 + $95.9* = **$879.2** | $494.9 | *Additional income from ($423.4M + $512.6M + $613.4M + $677.9M + $728.8M) x 3.0% ROIC* |
| **Total NPV of Forecasted Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | | **$2,839.9 Million** | |

#### **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   **Final Cash Flow in 2030 (FCF_2030):** $879.2 Million
*   **Terminal Value Formula (FCF_2030 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g):**
    *   ($879.2 \times (1 + 0.025)) / (0.090 - 0.025) = **$13,873.9 Million**
*   **Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV):**
    *   $13,873.9 / (1 + 0.090)^5.5$ (Mid-period discount) = **$8,561.0 Million**

#### **Total Net Present Value (NPV)**

*   **Total NPV = NPV (Forecasted) + NPV (Terminal Value)**
*   Total NPV = $2,839.9 Million + $8,561.0 Million = **$11,400.9 Million**

***

### **5. Fair Value Calculation**

The fair value of equity is calculated by subtracting Total Debt and adding Cash & Cash Equivalents to the Total NPV.

*   **Fair Value of Equity** = Total NPV + Cash – Total Debt
*   Fair Value of Equity = $11,400.9 Million + $97.65 Million – $5,290.0 Million
*   Fair Value of Equity = **$6,208.55 Million**

*   **Fair Value per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value per Share = $6,208.55 Million / 351,531,860 Shares
*   **Fair Value per Share = $17.66**

***

### **6. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value per Share:** **$17.66**

**Current Stock Price:** **$45.09** (Approx.)

#### **Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Price)**

The calculated Fair Value of **$17.66** is significantly lower than the Current Market Price of **$45.09**. This implies the market is making much more aggressive assumptions about GFL's future profitability and/or applying a lower discount rate than the conservative model used here.

**The Market's Assumptions (vs. Conservative Model):**

1.  **Lower Cost of Capital (Discount Rate):** The market is likely pricing GFL at a lower WACC. A lower WACC (e.g., 6.5%) would drastically increase the valuation, reflecting lower perceived risk due to the stable, monopolistic nature of the waste management industry.
2.  **Higher Long-Term Growth (Terminal Rate):** The market is likely assuming a higher terminal growth rate (e.g., 3.5% - 4.0%), reflecting an expectation of continued market share capture and tuck-in M&A being accretive for a longer period.
3.  **Higher Net Income Margin:** The most significant difference is likely the profitability conversion. The market is giving management the benefit of the doubt on the **Net Income Margin**. The conservative model assumes high D&A and Interest Expense will continue to weigh heavily on Net Income (resulting in a 2030 Net Income Margin of **8.25%**).
    *   **Market Implication:** To justify a $45.09 price, and assuming the same revenue/discount rate, the market is implicitly projecting a long-term Net Income Margin closer to **18% - 20%**. This margin level would assume a much higher efficiency and/or a substantial deleveraging/refinancing that significantly reduces the interest expense over the next decade. The sale of the ES business was used to pay down debt, and the market is likely anticipating a faster pace of debt reduction and interest savings than the model assumes.

**Justification for Conservative Model:**

*   The model intentionally adopted a conservative approach as requested.
*   The continued high debt level ($5.29B) and corresponding interest expense are a major drag on Net Income, even with a strong Adjusted EBITDA margin. The model accurately reflects this cost, which is often smoothed out or ignored by the market focus on Adjusted EBITDA.
*   The use of a higher, but reasonable, 9.0% Discount Rate reflects the risk associated with GFL's high leverage and execution risk inherent in its aggressive M&A growth strategy.
*   The final low valuation is a reflection of **the cost of debt** and the highly leveraged nature of the company's balance sheet, which is consuming a large portion of the excellent operating cash flow (Adjusted EBITDA).
