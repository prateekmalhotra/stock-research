## 2. Calculation of Cash & Debt

We will use the most recently available year-end financials and management's key leverage metrics for the most accurate and up-to-date figures.

### A. Total Cash & Cash Equivalents

Based on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2025:

| Metric | Value (CAD millions) | Source/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash | **$85.6** | From the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of Dec 31, 2025. |

**Total Cash & Cash Equivalents = $85.6 million CAD**

### B. Total Debt

Instead of manually calculating current and non-current debt from limited balance sheet snippets, we will use the most recent management-guided 'Net Leverage' ratio and Adjusted EBITDA to back-calculate Net Debt, and then Total Debt, which reflects the company's current financial profile and de-leveraging strategy.

| Metric | Value (CAD millions) | Source/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Adjusted EBITDA (FY 2025) | **$1,985.0** | Full year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA. |
| Net Leverage (FY 2025) | **3.4x** | Lowest year-end net leverage in company history. |
| **Calculated Net Debt** | $1,985.0 \times 3.4 = **$6,749.0** | (Adjusted EBITDA x Net Leverage) |
| **Total Debt** | $6,749.0 + 85.6 = **$6,834.6** | (Net Debt + Cash) |

**Total Debt = $6,834.6 million CAD**

## 3. Business Engine & Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

GFL's business engine is driven by a combination of: 1) **Core Pricing** (inflationary pass-through and strategic pricing), 2) **Volume Growth**, 3) **Net M&A Contribution** (densifying existing footprint), and 4) **New Projects** (RNG/EPR).

The projection starts with 2025 actuals and 2026 management guidance (based on the Q4 2025 earnings release), which is treated as 'truth' per the rules. The average 2025 USD/CAD rate was 1.40, and the projected 2026 rate is 1.36.

### A. Revenue Growth Projections

| Metric | 2025 (Actual) | 2026 (Guidance) | 2027 (Estimate) | 2028 (Estimate) | 2029 (Estimate) | 2030 (Estimate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starting Revenue (CAD millions)** | **$6,615.9** | **$7,000.0** | **$7,419.6** | **$7,761.6** | **$8,064.0** | **$8,339.4** |
| **Implied Growth Rate** | N/A | $7,000/6,615.9 - 1 = **5.8%** | **6.0%** | **4.6%** | **3.9%** | **3.4%** |
| **Core Price** | 6.1% | 5.5% (mid-5s) | **5.0%** | **4.5%** | **4.0%** | **3.5%** |
| **Volume** | 0.5% | 0.38% (mid-point) | **0.30%** | **0.30%** | **0.30%** | **0.30%** |
| **Net M&A** | (Included in guidance) | 2.5% | **1.5%** | **1.5%** | **1.5%** | **1.5%** |
| **Commodities/FX/Other** | (Included in actual) | (0.5%) | **(0.8%)** | **(1.7%)** | **(1.9%)** | **(1.9%)** |

**Justification for Revenue Estimates (2027-2030):**
*   **Conservatism:** The 2026 guidance implies an organic/M&A-driven growth of around 7.88% before FX. For 2027-2030, a *decline* in growth rate is projected, reflecting a conservative view:
    *   **Core Price:** Rolled down from 5.5% to 3.5%, assuming inflation moderates and the ability for outsized price hikes diminishes.
    *   **Volume:** Held conservatively low at 0.30%, reflecting minimal, steady organic growth in a mature industry.
    *   **Net M&A:** Reduced significantly to 1.5% (from 2.5% in 2026 guidance), aligning with management's goal of de-leveraging and potentially slowing the pace of M&A.
    *   **Commodities/Other:** This line is used to bring the total estimated growth to a conservative, steadily declining rate (6.0% down to 3.4%) as the company matures.

### B. Margin and Net Income Projections

Management is guiding for significant margin expansion. We will use the historical relationship of Net Income (NI) to Revenue for the starting point and apply conservative annual margin expansion, primarily driven by a lower interest expense from de-leveraging and EBITDA margin growth.

| Metric | 2025 (Actual) | 2026 (Guidance) | 2027 (Estimate) | 2028 (Estimate) | 2029 (Estimate) | 2030 (Estimate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (CAD millions)** | $6,615.9 | $7,000.0 | $7,419.6 | $7,761.6 | $8,064.0 | $8,339.4 |
| Adjusted EBITDA (CAD millions) | $1,985.0 | $2,140.0 | $2,298.6 | $2,437.0 | $2,583.5 | $2,735.6 |
| **Adj. EBITDA Margin (%)** | 30.0% | 30.6% | **30.9%** | **31.4%** | **32.0%** | **32.8%** |
| **Net Income from Cont. Ops. (CAD millions)** | $241.1 | $341.6 | $460.0 | $593.4 | $751.4 | $923.6 |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 3.64% | 4.88% | **6.19%** | **7.64%** | **9.32%** | **11.07%** |

**Justification for Margin Estimates (2027-2030):**
*   **EBITDA Margin:** The projected increase of $\sim$30-60 bps per year is conservative compared to the 130 bps increase seen from 2024 to 2025. It reflects the benefits of scale, operational efficiencies, successful integration of acquisitions, and the contribution of high-margin projects like RNG/EPR, which are expected to generate $\$175$ million CAD of EBITDA by 2026.
*   **Net Income Margin:** GFL is emerging from unprofitability (Net Income of $-\$897.5M$ CAD in 2024 to $\$241.1M$ CAD in 2025). The substantial expansion in Net Income Margin is primarily driven by:
    1.  The EBITDA margin expansion.
    2.  The significant reduction in interest expense due to the commitment to de-leveraging (Net Leverage dropped to 3.4x in 2025). This is the key driver of the Net Income improvement. The projected increase in Net Income is necessary to reach the guided lower-3x net leverage target over time.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for each year is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF), as requested by the rule "Assume that net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."

### A. Net Income Projection with ROIC

The rule is: *Net Income (t) = Net Income (t, projected) + ROIC * Net Income (t-1)*.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative but reasonable ROIC of **8.0%** is used. This represents the returns the company can generate by reinvesting its retained earnings (i.e., the prior year's net income).

| Metric (CAD millions) | 2025 (Base) | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Projected Net Income (before ROIC)** | $241.1 | $341.6 | $460.0 | $593.4 | $751.4 | $923.6 |
| B: ROIC from Prior Year's Net Income (NI * 8.0%) | N/A | $19.3 | $27.3 | $36.8 | $47.5 | $60.1 |
| **C: Total Cash Flow (A + B)** | N/A | **$360.9** | **$487.3** | **$630.2** | **$798.9** | **$983.7** |

### B. Discounted Net Present Value (NPV)

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable rate of **10.0%**. This reflects GFL's improved but still leveraged balance sheet and the stability of the waste management industry.
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (Maturity Rate):** A very conservative rate of **2.5%** is used for the terminal value, reflecting long-term inflation and minimal real growth in a mature industry.

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (C, CAD millions) | Discount Factor (1.10)^-t | NPV (CAD millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026 (t=1) | $360.9 | 0.9091 | $328.1 |
| 2027 (t=2) | $487.3 | 0.8264 | $402.6 |
| 2028 (t=3) | $630.2 | 0.7513 | $473.5 |
| 2029 (t=4) | $798.9 | 0.6830 | $545.6 |
| 2030 (t=5) | $983.7 | 0.6209 | $610.9 |
| **Sum of Projected Cash Flows NPV (2026-2030)** | | | **$2,360.7** |

### C. Terminal Value

The terminal value calculation uses the Gordon Growth Model based on the last projected cash flow (2030):
$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$983.7 \times (1 + 0.025)}{0.10 - 0.025} = \$13,443.0 \text{ million CAD}$$

The Net Present Value of the Terminal Value is:
$$\text{NPV}_{\text{TV}} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{t=5}}$$

$$\text{NPV}_{\text{TV}} = \$13,443.0 \times 0.6209 = \mathbf{\$8,346.7} \text{ million CAD}$$

### D. Total Net Present Value

$$\text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV}_{\text{Sum of Cash Flows}} + \text{NPV}_{\text{TV}}$$

$$\text{Total NPV} = \$2,360.7 + \$8,346.7 = \mathbf{\$10,707.4} \text{ million CAD}$$

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$10,707.4 + \$85.6 - \$6,834.6 = \mathbf{\$3,958.4} \text{ million CAD}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share (CAD)} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share (CAD)} = \frac{\$3,958.4}{357.92} = \mathbf{\$11.06} \text{ CAD/share}$$

### Final Fair Value (USD)

$$\text{Fair Value per Share (USD)} = \frac{\text{Fair Value per Share (CAD)}}{\text{USD/CAD Exchange Rate}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share (USD)} = \frac{\$11.06}{1.35} = \mathbf{\$8.19} \text{ USD/share}$$

---

## 6. Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share (USD)** | **$8.19 USD** |
| Current Market Price (NYSE: GFL) | **$41.33 USD** |

**The calculated fair value of $\$8.19$ USD is significantly lower than the current market price of $\$41.33$ USD.**

### Justification for the Discrepancy

The market is making a fundamental assumption about GFL's future profitability and growth that is *drastically* more aggressive than the conservative model.

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Net Cash Flow/Profitability:** The DCF model uses Net Income as a proxy for cash flow. Net Income is inherently lower than the company's reported Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF).
    *   **Management's 2026 AFCF Guidance:** $\sim\$835$ million CAD.
    *   **Model's 2026 Net Income/Cash Flow:** $\$360.9$ million CAD.
    *   **The Difference:** The market is likely valuing GFL on its significantly higher AFCF, which is a common practice in the waste management industry (due to non-cash D&A and large CapEx), while this model is constrained to using the much lower **Net Income** as the cash flow metric, as per the strict instruction. The required use of Net Income (which subtracts all non-cash charges like D&A and amortization but adds back ROIC on the prior year's NI) rather than a more industry-appropriate metric like Adjusted Free Cash Flow is the **primary driver** of the low valuation.

2.  **Market Assumes Higher Terminal Value and Growth:**
    *   To justify a $\$41.33$ price with the $\sim\$7,000$ million 2026 revenue base, the market would need to project a much higher perpetual growth rate or a lower discount rate than the conservative **2.5%** and **10.0%** used in this valuation. A terminal value model based on the *market's* required Net Income to justify the current stock price would imply a massive reinvestment/growth engine.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated fair value is low due to the strict valuation rule of using **Net Income (plus ROIC)** as the sole cash flow metric, rather than the much higher **Adjusted Free Cash Flow (AFCF)** that the market, and management, uses for valuation. Since the AFCF is $\sim 2.3$ times higher than the Net Income in the 2026 guidance, using the AFCF would likely bring the fair value much closer to the current market price. The market is capitalizing GFL's high-quality, recurring cash flows (AFCF) which shield the negative impact of high non-cash expenses.
