### Step 2: Business Engine Analysis and Future Assumptions

IQVIA's business is fundamentally driven by long-term contracts in two main segments: **Research & Development Solutions (R&DS)** and **Technology & Analytics Solutions (TAS)**.

| Metric | Driver & Commentary | Assumption Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **R&DS Backlog:** \$32.4B (Sep 2025) with a TTM Book-to-Bill of 1.12x.. This long-term contract structure provides high revenue visibility. **Management Guidance (2025):** 4% to 7% constant currency ex-COVID growth. The company is positioned to capitalize on the industry recovery (IRA headwinds are stabilizing) and its core tech-enabled services. | **2025:** Use the midpoint of management's guidance range for constant currency ex-COVID growth. 2024 Revenue was \$15.405B. I will project 5.5% organic growth plus 1.5% from acquisitions (per Q2 2025 guidance) to derive the full 2025 revenue, and then use the management-reaffirmed range midpoint of **\$16.2 B**. **2026 - 2030:** Start with 6.5% for 2026 (slightly above the midpoint due to strong 1.12x book-to-bill and continued AI/RWE adoption), and then conservatively taper this down by 50 basis points (0.5%) each year to reflect market maturity and increased competition. |
| **Net Income Margin** | **LTM Net Margin:** 8.1% (down from 9.2% last year) due to competition and mix shift. **Management Commentary:** AI enablement will "help us long-term improve margins." The high-margin TAS segment (AI/RWE) is a key growth area. | **2025 (Base):** Use the LTM Net Margin of **8.1%** as the starting point for 2025. **2026 - 2030:** Conservatively project a small, gradual improvement of **0.25%** per year (e.g., 8.1% to 8.35% to 8.6%) to reflect the compounding efficiency gains from the high-margin AI and technology solutions, as guided by management. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | **Historical Data:** LTM ROIC of 6.68%, historical average ROIC of 7.5% from 2020-2024, peaking at 9.5% in 2024. **Context:** The latest TTM ROIC is 7.31% or 6.68%, which is below the calculated WACC (estimated to be around 10% - see WACC calculation later). | To be conservative, I will use a conservative ROIC of **7.5%** for all projected years. This is based on the 2020-2024 average, which is a reasonable and conservative long-term return for a company operating below its WACC, as per one source. |

### Step 3: Projected Financials and Net Present Value (NPV)

#### A. Revenue and Net Income Projections

Net Income for the next year = (Revenue \* Net Margin) + (Prior Year Cash (i.e., Net Income) \* ROIC). The starting point for cash generation is the LTM GAAP Net Income of $\sim\$1.28$B (2024).

| Year | Revenue Projection (A) | YoY Growth Rate | Net Margin % (B) | Base Net Income (A\*B) | Prior Year NI (Cash) | ROIC (7.5%) | Income from ROIC | **Total Net Income (DCF Cash Flow)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (LTM)** | \$15.90 B | - | 8.10% | \$1.29 B | N/A | N/A | N/A | **\$1.29 B** |
| **2025** | \$16.20 B | 1.89% (Est) | 8.10% | \$1.31 B | \$1.29 B | 7.5% | \$0.10 B | **\$1.41 B** |
| **2026** | \$17.25 B | 6.50% | 8.35% | \$1.44 B | \$1.41 B | 7.5% | \$0.11 B | **\$1.55 B** |
| **2027** | \$18.25 B | 5.80% | 8.60% | \$1.57 B | \$1.55 B | 7.5% | \$0.12 B | **\$1.69 B** |
| **2028** | \$19.18 B | 5.10% | 8.85% | \$1.70 B | \$1.69 B | 7.5% | \$0.13 B | **\$1.83 B** |
| **2029** | \$20.08 B | 4.70% | 9.10% | \$1.83 B | \$1.83 B | 7.5% | \$0.14 B | **\$1.97 B** |
| **2030** | \$20.93 B | 4.25% | 9.35% | \$1.96 B | \$1.97 B | 7.5% | \$0.15 B | **\$2.11 B** |

#### B. Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** Use a conservative long-term US Treasury yield: **4.25%**
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** Use a standard market-based premium: **5.5%**
*   **Beta:** Use the reported beta of **1.33** (higher than market average, reflecting higher volatility).
    *   Cost of Equity (CAPM) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta \* Equity Risk Premium
    *   Cost of Equity = $4.25\% + 1.33 * 5.5\% = 11.57\%$
*   **Cost of Debt:** Given the high debt load and leverage ratio (3.52x Adjusted EBITDA), and the current market environment, I will use a conservative interest rate assumption: **6.0%**
*   **Tax Rate:** Use the LTM Effective Tax Rate: **19.19%**
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = $6.0\% * (1 - 19.19\%) = 4.85\%$
*   **Weighting:** Use the Debt/Equity ratio of **2.42**. Total Capital = Debt + Equity.
    *   Weight of Debt = Debt / Total Capital = $2.42 / (1 + 2.42) = 70.76\%$
    *   Weight of Equity = Equity / Total Capital = $1 / (1 + 2.42) = 29.24\%$
*   **WACC (Discount Rate)** = ($W_e * K_e$) + ($W_d * K_d(1-t)$)
    *   WACC = $(29.24\% * 11.57\%$) + $(70.76\% * 4.85\%$) = **6.81%**

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

*   **Maturity (Terminal) Rate (g):** Given the company's size, industry leadership, and the high-growth phase of AI/RWE adoption, a **conservative** long-term growth rate must be used. I will use **2.5%** (slightly above long-term inflation to reflect minor real growth).
*   **Terminal Value (TV)** = (2030 Net Income \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   TV = (\$2.11 B \* (1 + 2.5\%)) / (6.81\% - 2.5\%$) = $\mathbf{\$50.08}$ **Billion**

#### D. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (@ 6.81%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1.41 B | 0.936 | \$1.32 B |
| **2026** | \$1.55 B | 0.876 | \$1.36 B |
| **2027** | \$1.69 B | 0.820 | \$1.39 B |
| **2028** | \$1.83 B | 0.768 | \$1.41 B |
| **2029** | \$1.97 B | 0.720 | \$1.42 B |
| **2030 (Operating)** | \$2.11 B | 0.674 | \$1.42 B |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | \$50.08 B | 0.674 | \$33.75 B |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$42.07 Billion** |

---

### Step 4: Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value** = NPV of Future Cash Flows + Current Cash - Total Debt

*   Total Equity Value = \$42.07 B + \$1.814 B - \$14.957 B
*   **Total Equity Value** = **\$28.93 Billion**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

*   Fair Value Per Share = \$28.93 B / 171.5 M Shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share** = **\$168.69**

---

### Step 5: Market Comparison and Justification

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Value | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$168.69** | **\$216.46** | **-22.07%** |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$28.93 B** | **\$37.12 B** (171.5M \* \$216.46) | **-22.07%** |

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **\$168.69** is approximately **22% lower** than the current market price of **\$216.46**. This discrepancy is a result of the model's conservative assumptions versus the market's more optimistic outlook, specifically regarding future growth and returns.

**The Market's Assumptions are Likely Higher in Two Key Areas:**

1.  **Long-Term Growth (Terminal Rate):** The market is likely pricing in a higher long-term growth rate ($g$) than my conservative assumption of **2.5%**. IQVIA's focus on next-generation solutions like **AI-enabled clinical trials and Real-World Evidence (RWE)** are disruptive technologies that have the potential to deliver high single-digit long-term growth in the CRO and data analytics market. If the market assumes a terminal growth rate of **3.5%** instead of 2.5%, the fair value increases to:
    *   New TV = (\$2.11 B \* 1.035) / (6.81\% - 3.5\%$) = \$66.19 B
    *   New Total Equity Value = \$66.19 B \* 0.674 + \$1.32 B + ... + \$1.42 B + \$1.814 B - \$14.957 B = **\$40.10 B**
    *   New Fair Value Per Share = \$40.10 B / 171.5 M = **\$233.82**

2.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** My conservative assumption of **7.5%** ROIC is below the company's estimated WACC of $6.81\%$, which suggests value is being created only marginally, or destroyed slightly, depending on the source. A company with a durable competitive advantage (a "wide moat") as suggested by some analyses, especially one transforming into a *tech-enabled* CRO, is expected to earn returns significantly *above* its cost of capital. The market likely models a higher, value-creating ROIC (e.g., 10-11.5%) as a result of the AI/RWE initiatives, which would significantly increase the "Income from ROIC" line item and thus the NPV.

**Conclusion:**

My calculated fair value is lower primarily because I used a **very conservative long-term growth rate ($g=2.5\%$)** and a **conservative ROIC (7.5%)** that doesn't fully capture the anticipated long-term profitability and competitive advantage that IQVIA expects to gain from its investments in **AI, data, and RWE**. The market is willing to pay a premium for this technological moat and the visibility offered by the **\$32.4 billion backlog**, which I believe is reflected by an implicit terminal growth rate closer to $\mathbf{3.5\%}$.
