## Business Summary

CNH Industrial is a major global company that manufactures and sells powerful, specialized machinery used in two core industries: Agriculture and Construction. The majority of its revenue comes from the Agriculture segment, selling large tractors, harvesters, and specialized implements globally under brands like Case IH and New Holland. Its customers are commercial businesses, primarily large-scale farmers who require advanced technology to manage extensive farmlands, and construction companies involved in significant infrastructure and building projects. Geographically, CNH has substantial sales across North America, Europe, and South America. The core business model involves manufacturing the equipment, distributing it through a vast independent dealer network, and crucially, offering financial services (loans and leases) to customers, which supports the expensive purchase of the machinery and drives equipment sales.

## Business Model Risk

CNH's earnings are highly sensitive to both near-term economic swings and long-term technological shifts. A primary near-term risk is the cyclical nature of demand. Sales immediately suffer if agricultural commodity prices drop, as farmers postpone purchasing expensive new equipment until their incomes recover. This cyclical downturn has occurred repeatedly throughout the company's history. A related threat is the financial segment: rapidly increasing interest rates make the necessary loans and leases prohibitively expensive for customers, causing sales to freeze. Long-term risks focus on intense competition, especially from dominant players like John Deere. CNH must invest massive amounts in developing 'precision agriculture' (high-tech, autonomous farming equipment) and sophisticated construction technology. Failure to meet these high-tech demands could permanently erode its market share. Additionally, being a manufacturer of physical goods, CNH faces persistent supply chain issues and high input cost inflation (e.g., steel), which directly harms profit margins, a risk magnified since 2020.

## Company History

The history of CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH) is a story of global consolidation, innovation, and refocusing on the essentials of farming and construction. The company's origins date back to the mid-19th century, but the current entity is a product of strategic mergers and a recent business separation.

### The Deep Roots and Inception of CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH)

1.  **A History of Pioneers:** The company's heritage traces back to two core agricultural pioneers: Case, founded by Jerome Increase Case in 1842 to manufacture threshing machines, and New Holland, established by Abe Zimmerman in 1895 to produce agricultural equipment.
2.  **The First Major Consolidation (CNH Global):** A pivotal moment occurred in 1999 when the American Case Corporation merged with the Dutch New Holland N.V. to create **CNH Global N.V.**. This consolidation created a major player in the global agricultural and construction equipment markets.
3.  **The Founding of CNH Industrial (2013):** The final step to forming the company as it is largely known today happened in September 2013. **CNH Industrial N.V.** was established through the merger of Fiat Industrial S.p.A. and CNH Global N.V.
4.  **Why the Business Was Founded:** The primary reason for this final merger was to **consolidate industrial power** and create a diversified global leader in capital goods. By bringing CNH's agricultural and construction equipment together with Fiat Industrial's trucks, commercial vehicles, and powertrain solutions, the new company aimed for greater scale, efficiency, and a stronger global competitive position.

### Problems and Headwinds Along the Way

5.  **Dealing with Internal Competition (Headwind):** In its early multibrand existence, the Case (red) and New Holland (blue) agricultural brands sometimes competed against each other in the marketplace, which was an internal inefficiency for the parent company.
6.  **Economic Downturns and Cycles (Headwind):** As a company that sells large machinery, CNH Industrial has always been exposed to the cyclical nature of agriculture and construction industries. Economic slowdowns, like a recent "slowing agriculture cycle" and lower demand, directly impact the sales of tractors and construction equipment.
7.  **Global Trade Uncertainty (Headwind):** The business has had to navigate difficulties like high tariff exposure and unpredictable government policies on international trade, which affect its ability to sell products across the world.
8.  **Managing Excess Inventory (Headwind):** In recent years, lower demand led to high inventory levels at dealerships, forcing the company to reduce its own production hours significantly. This requires careful management to avoid pressuring prices and profits.

### Innovative Solutions and Tailwinds That Fueled Growth

9.  **The Spin-Off to Simplify (Innovative Solution):** In 2022, CNH Industrial executed a major strategic move by spinning off its "On-Highway" commercial vehicle and powertrain businesses, including the Iveco and FPT Industrial brands, into a separate publicly traded company called Iveco Group.
10. **The Goal of the Spin-Off:** This allowed CNH Industrial to become a **"pure-play"** company, focused solely on its core, high-growth, high-margin agricultural and construction equipment segments. This move streamlined operations and sharpened the company's focus.
11. **Investment in Precision Technology (Innovative Solution/Tailwind):** Recognizing that the future of farming is digital, CNH acquired **Raven Industries** in 2021. This move gave CNH a major innovation hub in the U.S. and proprietary technology for precision agriculture, which allows farmers to apply exactly the right amount of seed, fertilizer, or spray in the right place.
12. **Focus on Autonomy and Automation (Innovative Solution):** A key strategic priority for CNH is achieving technology leadership in automation. They are actively developing solutions like autonomous tractors and automated tillage to help farmers address major problems like rising costs and severe labor shortages.
13. **Customer-Inspired Innovation (Solution/Tailwind):** The company has embraced a strategy of listening closely to customers and feeding that direct feedback into its product development pipeline. This ensures new products solve real-world farmer and builder challenges, such as the introduction of automated spraying solutions.
14. **Commitment to Sustainability (Tailwind):** CNH is targeting a net-zero carbon footprint by 2038 and investing heavily in sustainable solutions. An example is the New Holland T7 Methane Power tractor, which runs on biogas and helps farmers gain energy independence by turning farm waste (like cattle manure) into fuel.

### CNH Industrial Today and Its Goal

15. **Present-Day Focus:** CNH Industrial today is a global manufacturer of agricultural machinery (like tractors and combines under the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands) and construction equipment (like excavators and loaders under the CASE and New Holland Construction brands).
16. **The Company's Goal:** The company's stated purpose is **"Breaking New Ground,"** which centers on **Innovation, Sustainability, and Productivity.** The overarching goal is to enable its customers—the global farming and construction communities—to meet the massive challenges of feeding and sheltering a growing world population with greater efficiency.
17. **Strategic Positioning:** CNH aims to be a technology leader in the sector, striving to be the number one or number two agriculture brand in every product category it supplies, all while increasing efficiency and returns for its shareholders.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of CNH Industrial N.V. is primarily built on the historical strength of its legacy brands, its massive global physical network, and the high switching costs inherent in the heavy equipment industry, which is now being reinforced with a strategic focus on digital technology.

Here is an analysis touching upon the key subjects:

### The Moat and Differentiating Factors

1.  **Powerful Portfolio of Legacy Brands:** CNH Industrial’s growth is built on the 2013 merger of Fiat Industrial and CNH Global, which itself was a merger of Case and New Holland in 1999. This history created a portfolio of globally recognized brands—like Case IH and New Holland Agriculture—that have built decades of strong customer loyalty and are seen as trusted intangible assets.
2.  **Extensive Global Dealer and Service Network:** The most significant difference from potential new entrants is its vast distribution network with thousands of independent dealers and service centers across over 200 countries. This physical network ensures farmers have critical access to spare parts, maintenance, and expert service, which are essential for mission-critical equipment.
3.  **Customer Stickiness and High Switching Costs:** Customers, especially large-scale farmers, are highly reluctant to switch brands. This is due to the enormous cost of downtime, the need for parts and service to be readily available, and the compatibility of existing equipment with a single brand's implements and software. This creates a powerful, defensible moat, making the customer base very "sticky."
4.  **Strategic Focus on Precision Technology:** CNH is actively widening its moat through technological innovation, such as the acquisition and integration of Raven Industries, a leader in precision agriculture technology. This move positions the company to compete directly in the new era of high-tech farming and creates product differentiation through advanced digital solutions.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Oligopolistic Market Structure:** The agricultural equipment industry is highly concentrated, with a few large players like John Deere, CNH Industrial, and AGCO dominating the market. As the second-largest player in the North American agriculture market and a market leader in Europe, CNH benefits from this concentrated structure, which supports its ability to maintain healthy margins.
2.  **Aftermarket Revenue and Recurring Business:** The company has significant pricing power in its aftermarket business (parts and service). The demand for replacement parts and continuous servicing of mission-critical machinery is a predictable and recurring revenue stream with higher margins than initial equipment sales.
3.  **Global Diversification for Resilience:** With its top-line sales diversified across numerous countries, CNH is more resilient to economic downturns or poor harvests in any single region, providing financial stability that contributes to its overall market strength.

### Displacement and Investment in the Future

1.  **High Barrier to Entry for New Competitors:** It is extremely difficult to displace CNH, even for a well-capitalized new entrant. The cost of establishing a comparable global manufacturing base, creating a trusted brand reputation that spans decades, and, most importantly, building an exclusive, reliable dealer network is prohibitively high and takes many years.
2.  **Service Network Effect:** The extensive dealer network acts as a network effect. The more equipment CNH sells, the more valuable its service network becomes to farmers, as the density of service centers and spare parts inventory increases. This, in turn, makes a CNH purchase more attractive.
3.  **Commitment to R&D and Innovation:** CNH Industrial must constantly innovate to maintain its competitive edge against rivals like John Deere, especially in the precision agriculture sector. The company's operations include R&D centers to continually develop new and advanced technologies to meet the evolving needs of modern farming and construction. Its strategic initiatives and focus on new technologies demonstrate a commitment to making necessary investments for future competitiveness.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on recent earnings calls, investor relations releases, and company news, the catalysts for CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH) stock price are as follows:

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Addressing Cyclical Downturn)**

1.  **Inventory Correction Completion:** Management is focused on a strategic reduction of dealer inventory, which caused lower sales volume and revenue declines in 2024 and 2025. The stock price could increase as the company nears its target inventory levels, signaling an end to production cuts and a stabilization of sales.
2.  **Strong Free Cash Flow Generation:** Despite lower revenue, the company demonstrated a robust free cash flow from Industrial Activities (e.g., \$451 million in Q2 2025) driven by improved working capital management. Sustained strong cash flow supports operations and shareholder return plans.
3.  **Cyclical Market Rebound:** Management views 2025 as the "cyclical trough year" for equipment demand. A market recovery, especially in the weak North American agriculture segment, would lead to higher volumes and a positive shift in the geographic sales mix, driving revenue and margin growth.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Strategic and Structural)**

1.  **"Iron + Tech" Integration and Precision Tech Growth:** The company's new Strategic Business Plan aims to significantly advance the integration of machinery ("Iron") and digital technology ("Tech"). The goal is to double Precision Tech sales and internally develop 90% of Precision Tech systems by 2030.
2.  **Expansion of Profit Margins:** The strategic plan sets ambitious mid-cycle adjusted EBIT margin targets for 2030: 16–17% for the Agriculture segment and 7–8% for the Construction segment. Achieving these targets would significantly increase profitability and shareholder value.
3.  **Starlink Partnership for Connectivity:** A strategic collaboration with Starlink to provide satellite-based connectivity for farm equipment in remote areas is expected to enhance product value, support agricultural productivity, and boost aftermarket services.
4.  **Increased Shareholder Returns:** CNH plans to increase Industrial cash generation by 25% over the business cycle and intends to return almost all of its Industrial free cash flow to shareholders through dividends (targeting 25-35% of net income) and share buybacks.

### **Management's Strategy as Explicitly Stated (from Earnings Calls)**

*   **Focus on Long-Term Positioning:** CEO Gerrit Marx stated, "We manage daily, we report quarterly, and position CNH Industrial N.V. for the next decade," emphasizing long-term success over immediate quarterly fluctuations.
*   **Five Key Strategic Pillars:** Management is executing on five pillars: expanding product leadership, advancing "Iron and Tech" integration, driving commercial excellence, operational excellence, and embedding "quality as a mindset."
*   **Cost Control to Mitigate Headwinds:** The company has initiated aggressive cost-control measures and is aligning production with retail demand to partially offset the negative margin impact from lower sales volumes.
*   **Construction Business Optionality:** Management has paused any decision on the long-term pathway for the Construction business (e.g., spin-off or strategic partnership) until market uncertainty lessens, allowing them to focus on stabilizing the current business.

## Management Record

The management of CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH) is in a period of transition, moving from a successful restructuring phase under the former CEO to a new strategic execution phase under the current CEO, Gerrit Marx.

### **Current CEO & Executive Team**

1.  **Current CEO and Background:** Gerrit Marx assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer in July 2024, succeeding Scott Wine. Marx brings a background from senior roles at McKinsey, Daimler Trucks, and Bain Capital, and previously served as the CEO of Iveco Group, which was spun off from CNH.
2.  **Executive Team Experience:** The current management team has a relatively short average tenure of approximately 1.3 years, suggesting a newly appointed leadership structure focused on the company's next phase of development.
3.  **Mandate and Popularity:** CNH's Chair expressed delight at Marx's return, expecting him to bring the same energy he demonstrated at Iveco to navigate the current "end-market downcycle" by focusing on cost management, inventory, and expanding margins.
4.  **Compensation:** Marx's total yearly compensation is approximately \$19.50 million, which is considered above average compared to similar-sized companies in the US market.

### **Previous Management: Scott Wine (Jan 2021 – Jun 2024)**

5.  **Key Strategic Decisions:** Former CEO Scott Wine's tenure was defined by the major decision to spin off the Iveco Group (the highway business) in 2022, transforming CNH into a dedicated "agriculture and construction pure-play". He also oversaw the strategic acquisition of Raven Industries in 2021, a key move to integrate precision agriculture technology.
6.  **Performance and Promises:** Wine delivered on promises to streamline the company's focus, achieving three consecutive years of record revenues and record EBIT margins during his more than three-year tenure.
7.  **Shareholder Value Delivery:** Under Wine, the company returned over \$3 billion to shareholders by May 2024 through dividends and share buybacks. However, CNH's compounded annual Total Shareholder Return (TSR) from 2021-2024 was -8.4%, which was below the peer group average, indicating that operational success did not fully translate to stock price outperformance.
8.  **Reason for Change:** Wine departed at the end of the company's three-year business plan cycle, a decision accepted by the Board, which he attributed to his desire to pursue other interests.

### **Future Strategy and Vision (2030 Strategic Business Plan)**

9.  **Vision and Goal:** CNH's future strategy, detailed at its 2025 Investor Day, is centered on a "Breaking New Ground" purpose, focusing on sustainable growth, margin expansion, and greater returns to shareholders through 2030.
10. **Key Strategic Pillars:** The plan is based on four main pillars: integrating machinery and technology, expanding adjusted EBIT margins, growth in the construction segment, and returning a high percentage of industrial cash flow to shareholders.
11. **Technology and Margin Targets:** The company aims to nearly double the contribution of high-margin Precision Technology sales in its agriculture segment by 2030, with a target of developing 90% of these solutions internally. Adjusted EBIT margin targets for 2030 are 16–17% for agriculture and 7–8% for construction.
12. **Near-Term Challenges:** Marx's leadership begins amid challenging market conditions, with the company reporting lower Q2 2025 results (14% lower consolidated revenue and a drop in EPS) due to a downcycle, which the new management is addressing with inventory and cost-control initiatives.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of CNH Industrial N.V.'s (CNH) executive compensation and ownership disclosures, the following points summarize the management's incentive structure:

### **1. Insider Ownership and Managerial Stake**

*   **Low Personal Ownership:** The direct share ownership by top management appears relatively low, which typically indicates a weaker personal financial alignment with common shareholders. For example, CEO Gerrit Marx directly owns only 0.03% of the company's shares.
*   **Controlling Shareholder Influence:** A single related party, EXOR N.V., holds a significant stake, controlling 42.9% of CNH's voting power as of mid-2023. This controlling interest allows EXOR to significantly influence shareholder decisions, including the election of directors, which is a stronger factor in CNH's governance than the personal holdings of the non-EXOR affiliated management.

### **2. Compensation Structure and Alignment**

*   **High At-Risk Compensation:** The executive pay structure is heavily performance-based, meaning a high percentage of total compensation is "at-risk." For the CEO, approximately 96.8% of his total compensation is derived from bonuses, stock, and options, with only 3.2% from base salary.
*   **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Alignment:** Long-Term Incentive awards, primarily Performance Share Units (PSUs), are structured over a three-year period and vest based on key financial metrics that directly benefit shareholders. The primary performance criteria for PSUs include:
    *   **Industrial Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** (50% weight), which encourages efficient capital management.
    *   **Cumulative Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)** (50% weight), which focuses on bottom-line earnings growth.
    *   **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, which acts as a multiplier to adjust the payout based on stock price performance compared to a peer group.

### **3. Conclusion on Management Incentive**

*   **Structural Alignment is Strong:** The **compensation structure itself** is well-designed to motivate management to act in the long-term interest of shareholders, as a majority of their pay is contingent on achieving goals like superior ROIC, EPS growth, and competitive Total Shareholder Return.
*   **Low Personal Skin in the Game:** While the *structure* is good, the low level of **direct equity ownership** by the management team (e.g., 0.03% for the CEO) suggests that a large portion of their personal wealth is not tied up in the company's stock *outside* of their unvested compensation awards. This lessens the "shareholder-first" pressure from a purely ownership perspective.
*   **Incentivized by the Controlling Shareholder:** Ultimately, the management's incentives are highly aligned with the interests of the largest shareholder, EXOR N.V., who can exercise substantial control over the company's direction. The structural alignment of the compensation plan ensures that even if managers are not high-percentage owners, their large, at-risk equity awards will only fully pay out if they deliver strong, shareholder-friendly financial results.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of its recent price history and technical indicators, CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH) is trading near the lower end of its 52-week range.

Here is a breakdown of its price history and technical standing:

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is trading approximately **8.0%** above its 52-week low.
    *   The approximate current price of CNH is around \$10.80 (as of early October 2025), and its 52-week low is \$10.00.

2.  **Technical Analysis - Trading Low:** Technically, the stock is showing signs of being at a discounted price point, with some indicators suggesting it is "oversold."
    *   As of early October 2025, CNH's Relative Strength Index (RSI) had dropped to approximately 27.4, which puts the stock into **oversold territory** and may indicate a potential buying opportunity for momentum traders.
    *   The stock is generally trading in the **lower part of its 52-week range**.

3.  **Technical Analysis - Bearish Signals:** Despite the oversold signal, other technical indicators present a more bearish outlook.
    *   The stock price is currently **below its key simple and exponential moving averages** (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200-day), which is a classic technical sign suggesting a downward trend.
    *   The overall **long-term trend is still considered negative**, though a short-term trend has recently shown a positive shift.

4.  **Big Drop Explanation (Last Few Months):** The stock experienced a significant drop, notably a **10.36% fall** over the month leading up to early October 2025. This was largely tied to investor concern following second-quarter 2025 earnings.
    *   CNH reported an earnings beat for Q2 2025; however, the stock dipped, which is often a result of a disappointing forward-looking guidance or outlook that outweighs the current quarter's positive results.
    *   The company lowered its full-year 2025 net sales forecast for its Agriculture segment, citing a slowdown in the South American farm equipment market, which spurred investor concern and subsequent selling pressure.

5.  **Analyst Outlook:** The stock is generally considered undervalued by some analysts who are maintaining a "Buy" consensus rating.
    *   The median analyst price target is \$14.51, which represents a significant potential upside from the current price.
    *   However, some firms have recently **lowered their price targets** (e.g., to \$13), specifically citing pressure on profit margins.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for CNH is based on a successful transformation from a cyclical heavy equipment maker into a high-tech agricultural technology company. The current low stock price reflects a temporary slowdown in farmer demand and production cuts, offering an attractive entry point. In the near term, strong internal cash generation and the expected completion of dealer inventory reduction will stabilize sales and support share buybacks. Over the long term, CNH's strategic focus solely on its core farming business (following the truck division spin-off) and its heavy investment in digital farming technology will significantly increase profit margins. This new, high-margin revenue stream from 'Precision Tech' products, along with the plan to return substantial free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks, means CNH will be a structurally more profitable company that warrants a much higher valuation once the market cycle recovers.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions are that the global agriculture equipment demand cycle bottoms out and begins to recover by 2026. Management must successfully execute its strategic plan, particularly achieving the ambitious 2030 margin expansion goals by fully integrating high-margin precision technology (Raven) across all products. The company must also maintain its competitive position against rivals like John Deere in the high-tech autonomy race. Finally, the company must follow through on its promise to return a high percentage of its industrial free cash flow to shareholders to boost Earnings Per Share.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key flaws and risks in the CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH) bull thesis.

## Bear Case Critique: Holes and Faults in the Long Thesis

The long thesis oversimplifies the severity of the downturn, the intensity of the competitive threat from its main rival, and the execution risk associated with its transformation into a high-margin tech company.

### 1. The Cyclical Downturn is Deeper and More Prolonged than "Temporary"

*   **Severe and Prolonged Revenue Contraction:** The current outlook is for a significant and broad revenue decline, with the Agriculture segment expected to drop between 12% and 20% year-over-year in 2025. This suggests a prolonged trough, making the "temporary slowdown" label misleading and delaying any potential recovery that the stock price is supposed to be awaiting.
*   **Dealer De-stocking Headwind:** While dealer inventory reduction is a necessary step, the company is deliberately continuing to lower production (forecasted to drop another 15-20% in 2025) to force this reduction. This active management of the channel directly and negatively impacts both 2025 net sales and segment margins, meaning the "stabilization of sales" is further out than implied.
*   **Uncertainty on Recovery Timing:** The core assumption that the demand cycle "begins to recover by 2026" is a high-risk gamble. Given the severity of the 2025 forecast, any delay in farmer purchases beyond 2026, due to sustained high interest rates or lower commodity prices, would severely impair valuation and cash flow generation.

### 2. High-Margin Transformation and Competitive Execution Risk

*   **Massive, Structural Margin Gap:** The goal to become a "structurally more profitable company" is challenged by a significant margin gap with its main rival. CNH's industrial activities adjusted EBIT margin (10.5% in 2024) is structurally much lower than that of the industry leader, John Deere. Closing this gap, especially during a volume downturn, is an immense execution challenge.
*   **Challenging the Undisputed Leader:** The assumption to "maintain its competitive position against rivals like John Deere" understates the difficulty of the task. John Deere remains the undisputed industry leader in the crucial North American market, with greater brand loyalty and a head start in proprietary software and data analytics technology.
*   **Raven Integration Risk:** While the Raven acquisition bridged the "autonomous gap," the success hinges on the full, seamless integration of that technology across all CNH products to realize the ambitious margin and revenue synergies. A failure to retain key Raven talent or a slower-than-expected integration would prevent the profitable "Precision Tech" revenue stream from materializing on schedule.

### 3. Financial and Portfolio Drags

*   **Weak Free Cash Flow in the Trough:** The promise to "return a high percentage of its industrial free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders" is complicated by the cyclical nature of its FCF. The full-year 2024 Industrial FCF was a negative outflow, and the 2025 guidance of $100 million to $500 million is modest, limiting the capacity for substantial, value-boosting share buybacks in the near term.
*   **The Construction Segment Drag:** The thesis focuses *solely* on agriculture, but the non-core Construction segment remains a drag, with forecasted net sales declining 5-10% in 2025. The continued presence of this lower-margin, cyclical business detracts from the "pure-play agricultural technology company" narrative and valuation multiple.

---

## Next Steps

This is a very strong foundation for an investment analysis. The debate is clearly defined between the *cyclical trough* (Bear Case) and the *structural transformation* (Long Thesis).

The next step is to use the data to stress-test the Long Thesis's core assumptions: the feasibility of closing the margin gap and the timing/severity of the cyclical recovery.

Here are the most important next steps and questions left unanswered, informed by the initial search results:

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

1.  **Quantify the Margin Gap with John Deere (Needed: Direct Comparison):**
    *   Find the most recent side-by-side comparison of **John Deere's (DE) Production & Precision Ag Operating Margin** versus **CNH's Agriculture Adjusted EBIT Margin** (The previous analysis notes a "massive, structural margin gap" but doesn't provide the current figures to quantify the difficulty of CNH's 2030 target of 16-17%).
    *   *Initial search partially covered this by noting DE's margin was above 26% and CNH's mid-teens in 2023, but a recent Q2/Q3 2025 comparison is necessary.*

2.  **Evaluate the "Precision Tech" Execution and Revenue Acceleration (Raven Industries):**
    *   Investigate the **current dollar value or percentage of net sales** coming from "Precision Tech" (Raven integration) in the Agriculture segment for the most recent quarter (e.g., Q3 2025). This will help measure CNH's progress toward the goal of doubling the contribution of Precision Tech sales by 2030 and validate the high-margin narrative.
    *   *The Strategic Business Plan targets for 2030 are clear (double Precision Tech sales, 90% in-house), but the current base is not quantified.*

3.  **Stress-Test the 2026 Cyclical Recovery Assumption (External Data):**
    *   Find independent, external forecasts for **2026/2027 net farm income** and **large agriculture equipment sales** in North America and Brazil. This will provide an objective check on management's "cyclical trough year" forecast for 2025.
    *   Determine the current trend in **used equipment prices** and **dealer inventory of *older* models** to see if the dealer de-stocking is successfully moving excess inventory through the channel.

4.  **Determine the Controlling Shareholder's Near-Term Intent (EXOR N.V.):**
    *   Find any recent (2025) public statements or actions by **EXOR N.V.** (the controlling shareholder) regarding their CNH stake. This will clarify if their "long-term commitment" remains intact or if they are considering a capital action (e.g., selling down, taking the company private) in the face of the current stock underperformance.

5.  **Finalize the Construction Segment Strategy:**
    *   Search for the latest management commentary on the **"forward strategy for Construction."** The analysis noted a "pause on any decision" (like a spin-off), but the recent Strategic Business Plan (SBP) only targets a 7-8% mid-cycle EBIT margin by 2030. Clarify if a spin-off is definitively off the table, or if CNH is just waiting for the cycle to turn before monetizing the segment.
