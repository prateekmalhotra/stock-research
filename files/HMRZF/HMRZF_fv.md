## Valuation of H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) (HMRZF)

This valuation is based on the most recent financial reports available through SEC filings and public company reports for the financial year ending November 30, 2024, and associated earnings call transcripts. All figures are in **SEK (Swedish Krona)** million unless otherwise noted.

### 1. Financial Starting Point & Assumptions

The following figures are based on the full-year report 2024 (1 Dec 2023 – 30 Nov 2024):

| Metric | Value (SEK Million) | Source / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales (2024)** | 234,478 | Full-year report [cite: 5 in step 2] |
| **Net Income (2024)** | 11,584 | Full-year report [cite: 5 in step 2] |
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents** | 17,340 | As of Nov 30, 2024 [cite: 5 in step 2]. No liquid marketable securities are added; only cash is included. |
| **Total Debt (Interest-Bearing)** | **2,000** (Assumed) | The company reported a "financial net cash" position in Q3 2024, and the cash balance is significantly higher than zero (SEK 17,340M). The report mentioned repayment of short-term debt [cite: 5 in step 2]. For a conservative valuation, we assume a small, remaining interest-bearing debt, excluding lease liabilities, as the exact figure is not available as a single line item in the provided snippets. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 1,611.7 million | Average number of shares outstanding for 2024 [cite: 5 in step 2]. |
| **Tax Rate (2024)** | 25.0% | Calculated as Tax Expense (SEK 3,859M) / Profit After Financial Items (SEK 15,443M) [cite: 5 in step 2]. This will be used for future years. |

### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025–2030)

The H&M business engine is driven by a focus on profitable growth, brand strengthening, channel optimization, and strategic expansion.

**Business Engine Key Drivers & Assumptions:**
*   **Core Growth:** Full-year 2024 local currency sales grew only 1%, but the beginning of 2025 showed an acceleration, with sales up 4% in local currencies (Dec 2024 - Jan 2025) [cite: 7 in step 1]. This indicates that strategic investments are beginning to pay off.
*   **New Markets/Expansion:** The first H&M store in Brazil is set to open towards the end of 2025 [cite: 6 in step 1]. This represents a material new growth market for 2026 and beyond.
*   **Online Strength:** The online store performed well in Q4 2024, accounting for 30% of sales [cite: 3 in step 1], which is a higher-margin channel.
*   **Conservative Revenue Assumption:** Based on the management's commentary for "increased sales" [cite: 8 in step 1] and the recent 4% growth, we model a moderate acceleration in local currency growth, with a conservative tapering to a maturity rate. We will use the 2024 Net Sales of SEK 234,478M as the base for 2025.

| Year | Growth Rate (Local Currency) | FX Headwind Assumption (SEK) | Projected Sales Growth (SEK) | Projected Sales (SEK M) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 1.0% | N/A | (0.66%) | 234,478 | Base Year - Actual [cite: 6 in step 1] |
| **2025** | 3.5% | (2.0%) | 1.5% | 237,995 | Moderate growth acceleration from 2024 (1%) towards the 4% Dec/Jan result, offset by a conservative FX headwind. |
| **2026** | 4.0% | (1.5%) | 2.5% | 243,945 | Full-year benefit of new initiatives and Brazil launch at the end of 2025. |
| **2027** | 3.5% | (1.0%) | 2.5% | 250,044 | Sustained growth as the recovery efforts mature. |
| **2028** | 3.0% | (0.5%) | 2.5% | 256,295 | Growth tapers towards the long-term rate. |
| **2029** | 2.5% | 0.0% | 2.5% | 262,702 | Growth settles with no FX impact. |
| **2030** | 2.0% | 0.0% | 2.0% | 267,956 | Conservative long-term growth rate. |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

Management has guided for **increased profitability** [cite: 8 in step 1] and the operating margin for 2024 was 7.4% [cite: 6 in step 1], up from 6.2% in 2023. The gross margin was 53.4% in 2024 [cite: 6 in step 1], indicating a successful cost-saving and efficiency program.

**Net Income and ROIC Engine:**
*   **Net Income Margin:** We project a conservative improvement from the 2024 Net Income Margin of $11,584 / 234,478 \approx 4.94\%$. We assume a gradual improvement toward a conservative $5.50\%$ as the business gains efficiency.
*   **ROIC (Return on Incremental Cash):** Since the historical ROIC is complex to calculate without the full balance sheet, and Net Income is treated as cash flow, we assume a conservative, positive **10.0% ROIC** on the *accumulated cash balance* from the previous year. This reflects the company's ability to reinvest its growing cash balance or use it for buybacks/dividends that yield returns. We use the full Net Income from the previous year as the incremental cash for the ROIC calculation in the subsequent year.

| Year | Projected Sales (SEK M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) (SEK M) | Cash from Prev Year (B) (SEK M) | ROIC (10.0%) from (B) (SEK M) | Total Net Income (A + C) (SEK M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 234,478 | 4.94% | 11,584 | N/A | N/A | 11,584 |
| **2025** | 237,995 | 5.00% | 11,900 | 11,584 | 1,158 | 13,058 |
| **2026** | 243,945 | 5.10% | 12,441 | 13,058 | 1,306 | 13,747 |
| **2027** | 250,044 | 5.20% | 13,002 | 13,747 | 1,375 | 14,377 |
| **2028** | 256,295 | 5.30% | 13,583 | 14,377 | 1,438 | 15,021 |
| **2029** | 262,702 | 5.40% | 14,186 | 15,021 | 1,502 | 15,688 |
| **2030** | 267,956 | 5.50% | 14,737 | 15,688 | 1,569 | 16,306 |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the purpose of this DCF, as per the instruction that net income goes straight into cash.

#### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%** (A rate reflecting the risk profile of a mature, global fast-fashion retailer).
*   **Maturity Rate (Very Conservative):** **1.0%** (A rate well below inflation, reflecting long-term global GDP growth uncertainty).

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (CF) (SEK M) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.09)^t) | Present Value (PV) (SEK M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **22025** | 13,058 | 0.9174 | 11,977 |
| **2026** | 13,747 | 0.8417 | 11,569 |
| **2027** | 14,377 | 0.7722 | 11,098 |
| **2028** | 15,021 | 0.7084 | 10,642 |
| **2029** | 15,688 | 0.6499 | 10,195 |
| **2030** | 16,306 | 0.5963 | 9,720 |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030):** | | | **65,201** |

#### B. Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the 2030 cash flow, at the conservative maturity rate of $1.0\%$:

$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$TV_{2030} = \frac{16,306 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.09 - 0.01} = \frac{16,469}{0.08} = 205,863 \text{ SEK M}$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value:**

$$PV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = 205,863 \times 0.5963 = \mathbf{122,709} \text{ SEK M}$$

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (SEK Million) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | 65,201 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | 122,709 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **187,910** |
| **Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | 17,340 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt (Assumed)** | (2,000) |
| **Equity Value** | **203,250** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 1,611.7 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share (SEK)** | **126.11** |

### Final Valuation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (SEK)** | **126.11** |
| **Current Stock Price (HMRZF)** | *Current price as of market close on October 29, 2025, is approximately SEK 179.10 (HM B:STO).* [cite: 3 in step 2] |

*Note: The current price for the primary listing (HM B:STO) is used as HMRZF is an ADR and the current price is available as SEK 179.10.*

### Justification and Market Comparison

**The calculated Fair Value of SEK 126.11 is approximately 29.6% lower than the current market price of SEK 179.10.**

**Why the Discrepancy?**

My conservative valuation suggests the stock is currently overvalued by the market. This difference arises because the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future performance than my conservative model:

1.  **Market's Revenue Assumption:** My model uses a conservative long-term growth rate, tapering to $2.0\%$ by 2030. The market is likely pricing in a **higher, sustained revenue growth rate**, potentially $4-5\%$ annually, based on the recent $4\%$ sales growth and the successful turn-around strategy management is executing (i.e., brand strengthening, new market entry like Brazil, and online channel growth).
2.  **Market's Margin Assumption (Profitability):** My Net Income Margin projection tops out at a conservative $5.50\%$ in 2030. The market is likely anticipating the company to return to or exceed its historical peak profitability levels sooner, driven by a higher Net Income Margin in the range of **$6.0\%$ to $7.0\%$**. This aligns with management guiding for "increased profitability" [cite: 8 in step 1] and the strong gross margin performance in 2024.
3.  **Market's ROIC/Reinvestment Assumption:** My ROIC on accumulated cash is set at a conservative $10.0\%$. A market assuming an ROIC closer to $15-20\%$ (which is possible for a well-managed global retailer reinvesting efficiently) would yield a much higher cash flow trajectory.
4.  **Market's Discount Rate:** I used a conservative $9.0\%$ discount rate. The market may be using a lower discount rate, perhaps $7.0\% - 8.0\%$, suggesting lower perceived risk for H&M's profitable future.

**My Case for the Conservative Valuation (SEK 126.11):**

The current market is arguably giving H&M full credit for its turn-around *before* it has fully materialized and proven sustainable in a highly competitive and volatile fast-fashion sector (facing pressure from competitors like Shein and Zara). My valuation is justified due to:

*   **Sector Volatility:** The fast-fashion industry is subject to rapid trend changes, supply chain disruptions (e.g., Red Sea issues noted in the report), and intense price competition. My modest revenue and margin growth reflects the inherent risks in sustaining a market-beating performance over a decade.
*   **Conservative Business Engine:** While the December/January sales were strong, a single period does not make a trend. The model correctly assumes a conservative tapering of growth, acknowledging the difficulty of continually extracting high-single-digit local currency growth in a mature market.
*   **Margin Headwinds:** Although gross margin has improved, selling and administrative expenses must be continually managed. My slower margin improvement to $5.50\%$ is a more cautious stance against potential future cost increases or the need for deeper markdowns to remain competitive.
