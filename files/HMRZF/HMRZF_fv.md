### **2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions**

The company's business engine is driven by a strategy focused on **profitability improvements** through:
1.  **Strengthening the customer offering:** Product, brand, and experience.
2.  **Cost Control & Efficiency:** Improved inventory management and cost reduction in selling and administrative expenses.
3.  **Store Optimization:** A net reduction of 152 stores in FY 2025, indicating a shift away from pure physical expansion to a more focused, profitable retail footprint.
4.  **Financial Targets:** Management is aiming for an operating margin approaching 10% and a normalized gross margin of 54-55%.

#### **A. Revenue Projection (2026 - 2030)**

Given the strategic shift toward store optimization and profitability (not aggressive expansion), and facing a competitive, mature fast-fashion market, a very conservative, slowly decelerating local currency growth rate is assumed, with an eventual maturity to 0% growth. The FY 2025 local currency sales growth was 2%.

| Year | Assumed Local Currency Revenue Growth | Revenue (SEK Millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | *Base Year* | 228,285 | FY 2025 Reported Net Sales. |
| **2026** | 2.0% | 232,851 | Continues the FY 2025 local currency growth rate, but assumes a neutral FX impact going forward. |
| **2027** | 1.5% | 236,334 | Slowing growth due to store closures and mature market penetration. |
| **2028** | 1.0% | 238,697 | Very low, mature market growth. |
| **2029** | 0.5% | 239,880 | Approaching steady state. |
| **2030** | 0.0% | 239,880 | Assumed terminal/maturity growth rate for revenue. |

#### **B. Margin Projection (2026 - 2030)**

The base FY 2025 Net Margin was $12,085 \text{m} / 228,285 \text{m} = \mathbf{5.3\%}$. Management's target is an Operating Margin approaching 10%. To be conservative, the Net Margin is projected to increase to a steady-state $\mathbf{7.5\%}$ by 2030.

| Year | Assumed Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income (SEK Millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 5.3% | 12,085 | FY 2025 Reported Net Income. |
| **2026** | 6.0% | 13,971 | Initial jump due to cost control and operating leverage. |
| **2027** | 6.5% | 15,362 | Continued improvement toward long-term operating margin target. |
| **2028** | 7.0% | 16,709 | Reaching a conservative steady-state margin. |
| **2029** | 7.5% | 17,991 | Approaching 7.5% as a conservative proxy for the 10% Operating Margin goal. |
| **2030** | 7.5% | 17,991 | Steady-state margin. |

### **3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**

The model assumes **Net Income acts as Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**, as per instructions. It also incorporates the growth of cash by assuming a **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** on the previous year's Net Income, which is assumed to be immediately reinvested cash.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ is used, reflecting the company's market and execution risks.
*   **Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate ($g$):** A very conservative $\mathbf{1.0\%}$ is used for the terminal value, reflecting a mature business in a highly competitive industry.
*   **ROIC on Prior Year Cash (Net Income):** A conservative $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ is used for the reinvested portion of the prior year's Net Income. (A reported normalized ROIC of $\sim 12.65\%$ suggests 5.0% is very conservative).

| Year | $\text{NI}_{\text{Proj}}$ (A) (SEK m) | $\text{NI}_{\text{Prior}}$ (B) (SEK m) | $\text{ROIC Added NI (B * 5.0%)}$ (C) (SEK m) | $\text{FCF}_{\text{Equity}}$ ($\text{A} + \text{C}$) (SEK m) | Discount Factor ($\text{10\%}$) | NPV (SEK m) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 12,085 | 11,584 (2024 NI) | 579 | 12,664 | 0.909 | 11,513 |
| **2026** | 13,971 | 12,664 (2025 $\text{FCF}_{\text{Equity}}$) | 633 | 14,604 | 0.826 | 12,069 |
| **2027** | 15,362 | 14,604 | 730 | 16,092 | 0.751 | 12,084 |
| **2028** | 16,709 | 16,092 | 805 | 17,514 | 0.683 | 11,965 |
| **2029** | 17,991 | 17,514 | 876 | 18,867 | 0.621 | 11,708 |
| **2030** | 17,991 | 18,867 | 943 | 18,934 | 0.564 | 10,676 |

**Terminal Value Calculation (as of EOY 2030):**

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{\text{Equity}} \text{ in } 2030 \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{18,934 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{19,123.34}{0.09} = 212,481.56 \text{ SEK millions}$$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

$$\text{NPV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = 212,481.56 \times 0.564 = 119,839 \text{ SEK millions}$$

**Total Equity Value (NPV of all Future Cash Flows):**

$$\text{Total NPV} = (\sum \text{NPV of Years 2026-2030}) + \text{NPV of TV}$$

$$\text{Total NPV} = (12,069 + 12,084 + 11,965 + 11,708 + 10,676) + 119,839$$

$$\text{Total NPV} = 58,502 + 119,839 = \mathbf{178,341 \text{ SEK millions}}$$

### **4. Final Fair Value Calculation**

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{NPV of Future FCFE} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = 178,341 + 20,910 - 20,700$$

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \mathbf{178,551 \text{ SEK millions}}$$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | SEK 178,551 m |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 1,602,438,375 |
| **Fair Value Per Share (SEK)** | $\text{SEK 178,551,000,000} / 1,602,438,375 = \mathbf{SEK 111.43}$ |

---

## **Conclusion and Justification**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (SEK)** | **SEK 111.43** |
| **Current Market Price (HMRZF, USD)** | **~$20.38** |
| **Current Market Price (SEK Equivalent)** | $\sim\text{SEK 185.55}$ (Using a representative SEK/USD rate near the Feb 11, 2026, stock price) |

**Justification for the Valuation Gap:**

The calculated fair value of **SEK 111.43 per share** is substantially lower than the current market price of approximately **SEK 185.55 per share**. The market's assumptions are significantly more optimistic than the conservative model used here.

**Reasons for the Discrepancy:**

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Growth (Faster Engine Speed):** The market is likely pricing in a more aggressive top-line growth. While the model used a maximal 2.0% annual local currency sales growth, the market likely assumes a return to pre-2020 growth levels or a more successful and immediate realization of new market expansion (e.g., Brazil) and online growth, driving local currency sales growth closer to **4-6%** annually.
2.  **Market Assumes Quicker/Higher Margin Realization:** The model capped the Net Margin at a conservative **7.5%**, well below the implied potential of the **10% Operating Margin** target set by management (which could translate to an 8.0%-9.0% Net Margin). The market is likely pricing the company to hit or even *exceed* the 10% operating margin target in the near term (2026-2027) due to the successful cost-saving and inventory-optimization programs.
3.  **Market Values High ROIC and Cash Reinvestment:** The model used an extremely conservative 5.0% ROIC on prior year cash. The market, seeing the historical normalized ROIC of $\sim 12.65\%$ and the recent operating efficiency gains, likely expects a much higher ROIC on retained earnings (e.g., $\mathbf{10\%}$ or more), which significantly compounds the terminal value.
4.  **Market Uses a Lower Discount Rate:** The model used a conservative $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ discount rate. Given the company's strong brand, low debt, and net cash position, the market may be using a lower WACC (e.g., $\mathbf{8.0\%}$), which dramatically inflates the Net Present Value of future cash flows.

**Conclusion:**

My valuation is a **conservative** estimate, deliberately handicapping the company's long-term growth and profitability (0.0% terminal revenue growth, 7.5% peak net margin, 5.0% ROIC, 10.0% discount rate) to ensure a high margin of safety. The market appears to be giving H&M full credit for achieving their long-term 10% operating margin goal and assumes that the recent operational efficiencies will translate into significantly higher sales growth and capital returns than what my prudent model projects. The $\text{SEK 111.43}$ per share valuation suggests the stock is **overvalued** based on these conservative assumptions, implying that a prudent investor should wait for a pullback or seek a lower entry point unless they believe H&M can sustain a 4%+ local currency sales growth while simultaneously achieving and maintaining an operating margin above 10%.
