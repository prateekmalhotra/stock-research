## Business Summary

Aegon primarily serves individuals and some businesses across the United States (through its major brand, Transamerica), the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The typical customer is an individual or family seeking long-term financial security, focusing on retirement savings (pensions and annuities) and life insurance coverage. The core business model involves acting like a financial intermediary: they collect regular payments (premiums) from customers, which they then invest in diverse assets (like bonds and real estate). Aegon earns profit from the difference between the high returns generated by these investments and the lower guaranteed returns they must eventually pay back to policyholders, alongside fees earned from managing retirement funds. Products like life insurance and pensions are the main revenue drivers.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term threat is global market volatility. If financial markets experience a sharp downturn, the value of the company’s massive investment portfolio declines rapidly, directly harming its capital position and earnings. A severe, ongoing risk is prolonged low interest rates. Since Aegon guarantees specific returns to policyholders, if the yields on the assets they invest in (mainly bonds) remain low for many years, the company struggles to earn a profit margin above its obligations. This interest rate dynamic was a major cause for concern following the 2008 financial crisis and remains a long-term strain on profitability. Furthermore, as a significant provider of retirement products, longevity risk is a key long-term concern. If customers live significantly longer than expected due to medical advancements, Aegon must pay out pensions and annuities for extended periods, which can strain long-term financial reserves.

### **Aegon Ltd.: A History of Mergers and Global Reach**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Deep Roots:** While the name Aegon is modern, the company's oldest origins date back nearly 180 years to the Netherlands. The very first predecessor was a small Dutch burial fund called **Algemeene Friesche Begrafenisfonds**, founded in 1844 in the province of Friesland, initially focused on providing financial security for funeral costs.

2.  **The Immediate Founding (1983 Merger):** The company known today as Aegon N.V. was officially formed in 1983 through the merger of two large, existing Dutch insurance companies: **AGO Holding N.V.** and **Ennia N.V.**.

3.  **Why the Business Was Founded:** The primary purpose of this 1983 merger was strategic consolidation. The domestic Dutch insurance market was contracting, and the combined entity aimed to create a much larger, stronger player that could compete more effectively in the rapidly globalizing insurance and financial services sector.

4.  **Core Goal:** At its heart, Aegon's business is about helping people achieve a lifetime of financial security. It was built to offer long-term financial products, specifically in life insurance, pensions, and asset management (managing investments for others).

#### **II. Early Growth and Tailwinds**

5.  **International Expansion as a Tailwind:** Facing a challenging domestic market, Aegon's management quickly focused on international growth, a strategy that served as a significant tailwind. This included entering the US market in the mid-1980s.

6.  **The Transamerica Tailwind (1999):** In a bold move, Aegon acquired the US-based **Transamerica Corporation** in 1999. This acquisition was transformative, instantly catapulting Aegon into the top tier of global insurers and making the United States its single largest and most central market.

7.  **Geographic Diversification:** By growing its operations in the UK, Spain, and other countries through strategic purchases, Aegon built a globally diversified business. This diversification provided a natural defense, as poor performance in one region could be offset by strength in another.

#### **III. Major Problems (Headwinds) and Solutions**

8.  **The Headwind of the 2008 Financial Crisis:** This was the company's biggest modern challenge. As financial markets collapsed, Aegon, like many global financial firms, faced severe capital shortages and was forced to accept a €3 billion (approximately \$3.2 billion) capital injection from the Dutch government to stabilize its balance sheet.

9.  **The Solution to the Crisis:** Aegon focused intently on strengthening its finances and managing its risk. The company worked to successfully repurchase all of the core capital securities from the Dutch State by 2011, demonstrating a full recovery and a return to financial independence.

10. **The Headwind of Low Interest Rates:** For much of the 21st century, persistent low interest rates in many countries were a major problem for insurance and pension companies. This "headwind" made it difficult for Aegon to earn a high return on the long-term investments that back their policies, thus pressuring profitability.

11. **The Solution: Strategic Simplification and Efficiency:** To combat market pressures, Aegon began a major strategic overhaul in the mid-2010s to simplify its business. They cut costs, focused resources on core markets, and started selling off non-core or less profitable assets.

#### **IV. Innovative Solutions and The Present Day**

12. **Focusing on Digital Platforms (Innovation):** In the UK, Aegon committed to transforming its business into a leading **digital savings and retirement platform**. This move leverages technology to streamline customer service, increase efficiency, and address the growing demand for self-service financial tools.

13. **The 2023 Strategic Combination (Innovative Solution):** The most significant recent event was the 2023 combination of almost all of Aegon's Dutch insurance, banking, and mortgage operations with a local competitor, **a.s.r. Nederland**.

14. **Current Goal and Refocused Business Model:** This transaction was a major step in the simplification strategy, providing Aegon with a large cash payment and a significant strategic minority stake in the new combined Dutch company. Today, Aegon's goal is to be a focused international player, concentrating its efforts on its fully owned businesses in the **United States** (via Transamerica) and the **United Kingdom**, along with its **Global Asset Manager**.

15. **The Ultimate Goal Today:** Aegon is concentrating on building leading businesses in investment, protection, and retirement solutions, which all tie back to its original purpose of helping people live their best lives through financial wellbeing.

## Moat Analysis

Aegon Ltd.'s moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, is not built on a single, unique product but rather on a combination of massive scale, regulatory barriers, and a distinct, large-scale distribution system that would be very costly and difficult for a competitor to replicate.

Here is an analysis of the moat and key differentiating factors:

### **Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Unique Distribution Network (Scale/Network Effect):** Aegon's main differentiator in the crucial U.S. market is its ownership of **World Financial Group (WFG)**, a multi-level marketing (MLM) affiliated network of over 87,000 independent agents. This vast, self-recruiting sales force provides a proprietary, hard-to-replicate channel for distributing Transamerica's life insurance and retirement products, especially to the underserved middle-market.
2.  **Financial and Regulatory Scale (Barrier to Entry):** As a massive, decades-old international financial services group, Aegon’s sheer size provides a competitive advantage through economies of scale, lower cost of capital, and a proven ability to manage complex risks. The stringent capital requirements and heavy regulation in the insurance industry mean that its strong capital position (high Solvency II ratios) acts as a powerful barrier to entry for any new company, regardless of capital size.
3.  **Recognized Brand and Trust:** The company's U.S. subsidiary, **Transamerica**, is a globally recognized financial brand. In a business built on trust and long-term security like insurance, brand recognition and an established history are powerful, non-monetary assets.

### **Special Pricing Power and Market Position**

4.  **Special Position in a Key Segment:** While the insurance market is intensely competitive, limiting broad pricing power, Aegon is focused on becoming the leading company in the U.S. middle-market for life insurance and retirement. This allows them to tailor products and sales efforts to a massive, slightly underserved demographic, giving them a specialized market position.
5.  **Shift to Fee-Based Revenue:** The company's strategic move to shrink its volatile traditional insurance business and grow its "Strategic Assets," such as its UK Workplace pensions platform and global asset management, is increasing the proportion of predictable, fee-based revenue. This shift improves the stability and quality of its earnings profile, which is a form of competitive strength.

### **Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk**

6.  **Reason for Growth (The Past):** Aegon grew into a global powerhouse primarily through decades of strategic, large-scale acquisitions. The most significant move was the **$10.8 billion acquisition of Transamerica Corporation in 1999**, which instantly made it one of the largest life insurers in the world and established its massive presence in the U.S.
7.  **Displacement Risk:** A newcomer with more capital would face two main challenges: **Regulation and Time**. The sheer capital required to meet regulatory reserve and solvency requirements for an insurance company of Aegon's size is a huge hurdle. Even with capital, recreating a physical distribution network like WFG or building a large-scale, functional digital platform like the one Aegon is building in the UK would take many years.

### **Customer Stickiness and Future Moat Building**

8.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The core products—life insurance, annuities, and retirement plans—are inherently long-term in nature. Customers generally buy these products once and maintain them for decades. This means Aegon's revenue from its "in-force" policies and assets under administration is highly **sticky and recurring**.
9.  **Investment in Digital Innovation (Future Moat):** To ensure a solid moat for the future, Aegon is investing significantly in **digital transformation**. The company is building next-generation digital platforms in the U.S. and U.K. to make its products easier for customers and advisors to use. This constant innovation is necessary to retain an edge against agile, tech-focused competitors and improve the efficiency of its distribution network.

---

## Catalyst Analysis

Aegon's stock catalysts are primarily driven by its ongoing business transformation, de-risking actions, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Within the next 12-18 months)

1.  **Hitting 2025 Financial Targets (Management Focus):** The company is on track to meet its 2025 financial targets, which management consistently emphasizes in earnings calls. These targets include achieving around **€1.2 billion** in Operating Capital Generation and roughly **€800 million** in free cash flow.
2.  **Increased Capital Return to Shareholders:** Management has committed to significant capital returns. The company has been executing large share buyback programs and aims to grow its dividend per share to around **€0.40** over 2025, which is a key priority.
3.  **Growth in the U.S. Business (Transamerica):** The US business, now focused on "Strategic Assets," is showing positive momentum. Management specifically highlights the continued growth in the World Financial Group (WFG) agent base and strong sales in life insurance and retirement plans.
4.  **Monetization of the a.s.r. Stake:** Aegon holds a 29.99% strategic shareholding in a.s.r. following the sale of its Dutch business. The sale of a portion of this stake, as seen in a September 2025 announcement, provides immediate cash proceeds that can be used for further share buybacks or new investments.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 months)

1.  **Full Transformation of the U.S. Business:** The long-term strategy focuses on transforming Transamerica into a leading middle-market life insurance and retirement company. A core part of this plan is to grow the WFG agent force to a target of 110,000 agents by 2027, which management views as crucial for sustainable growth.
2.  **Reallocating Capital from "Financial Assets":** Aegon's long-term strategy involves reducing the capital tied up in its lower-growth "Financial Assets" business in the U.S. and reallocating that capital to more profitable "Strategic Assets" and partnerships. Management has a target to reduce this capital to approximately \$2.2 billion by the end of 2027.
3.  **De-Risking the Business Profile:** The company's move to a focused business structure, including the divestment of its Dutch and Indian operations and the division of the U.S. business, is intended to improve its risk profile, reduce volatility, and make capital generation more predictable over the long term.
4.  **UK Digital Platform Success:** The strategy for the UK is to accelerate its transformation into a leading digital savings and retirement platform. Strong commercial momentum on the Workplace platform is a key indicator management is watching for future success in this segment.

## Management Record

The management analysis of Aegon Ltd. (AEG) for an investor is outlined below, focusing on the current CEO's performance, strategy, and track record.

### **Current Aegon Management: CEO Lard Friese**

1.  **CEO Appointment and Background:** Lard Friese was appointed CEO of Aegon Ltd. in May 2020, bringing over 30 years of insurance industry experience, including a previous tenure at Aegon from 1993 to 2003. His experience also includes serving as the CEO of NN Group N.V. from 2014, where he is credited with leading transformation and creating a stable platform for growth and shareholder value.

2.  **Leadership Style and Popularity:** Friese is described as a leader with a focus on "vulnerability" and "authenticity" in his leadership, emphasizing the importance of team trust and personal maturity in professional roles. In 2024, the Board of Directors proposed his re-election for a further four-year term, expressing confidence that he will continue to deliver on the execution of Aegon's strategy and create value.

3.  **Overall Performance and Track Record (2020 onwards):** Under his leadership, Aegon has undergone a significant transformation, resulting in the company becoming more focused, achieving improved operational performance, and maintaining a stronger balance sheet with an enhanced risk profile. His track record is noted for strong financial acumen, excellent capital management, and successful navigation of regulatory environments.

### **Key Strategic Decisions and Shareholder Value Delivery**

4.  **Strategic Divestment and Focus:** A cornerstone decision was the combination of Aegon's Dutch operations (insurance, banking, and mortgages) with a.s.r. (ASR Nederland N.V.) in 2022, which significantly simplified the group's structure and created a capital-light platform. The transaction was a major step in Aegon's ambition to transform and focus on its core businesses.

5.  **Capital Return and Shareholder Value:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to shareholder returns, which includes announcing a significant increase in the interim dividend (e.g., a 14% increase reported in one half of 2024) and expanding its share buyback programs. These actions are specifically intended to boost Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return on Equity (ROE) by reducing the equity base.

6.  **Operational Transformation:** The strategic sales and corporate actions have generated substantial proceeds, which are being used to optimize the balance sheet and bolster capital management goals. Furthermore, a multi-year plan has been launched to transform the UK business, focusing on investing to capture growth in the wealth management market.

### **Future Strategy and Vision**

7.  **Core Vision and Ambition:** The central strategic vision under Friese is to build leading businesses in three core areas: investment, protection, and retirement solutions.

8.  **US Market Focus:** A key element of the future strategy is to refocus heavily on the United States market, which currently accounts for a large portion of its operations. This US focus is a strategic pivot toward higher-growth opportunities.

9.  **Corporate Simplification:** Aegon is also reviewing a potential relocation of its legal domicile and head office to the United States. This move is intended to further simplify its corporate structure and align regulatory frameworks with its primary source of business.

### **Previous Management and Change Context**

10. **Previous Leadership Transition:** Lard Friese succeeded Alex Wynaendts as CEO of Aegon N.V. in May 2020.

11. **Context for Change:** Wynaendts had a long career with the company, but the subsequent praise for Friese's "transformation," "improved operational performance," and a "stronger balance sheet" suggests a mandate for the new management to address long-standing structural and financial complexities within the group.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Aegon Ltd.'s (AEG) recent remuneration filings, the management incentive and compensation structure demonstrates a strong, forward-looking intent to align executive interests with long-term shareholder value, despite the low current reported direct ownership.

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation for Aegon Ltd. (AEG)**

#### **I. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Direct Insider Ownership:** Public data indicates a low figure of approximately **0.00%** direct insider ownership by managers and directors, which is generally not ideal for strong shareholder alignment.
2.  **High Shareholding Requirement (Future Alignment):** This low current ownership is strongly mitigated by a strict shareholding requirement in the 2024 Directors' Remuneration Policy, which mandates that the Executive Director (CEO) must hold Aegon shares equivalent to **400% of their base salary**.
3.  **Mandatory Retention and Holding Period:** The required shareholding must be accumulated by retaining post-tax shares from the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) awards, and the CEO is prohibited from selling vested shares (except to cover tax) until this 400% threshold is met. Furthermore, vested LTI shares are subject to an additional **two-year holding period**, cementing a multi-year, long-term focus.

#### **II. Compensation Structure (Pay-for-Performance)**

1.  **Strong Emphasis on Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The CEO's incentive compensation places a greater weight on long-term performance, with the target Long-Term Incentive (paid in Aegon performance shares) set at **175% of the base salary** (compared to a 100% target for the cash-based Short-Term Incentive).
2.  **LTI Linked to Long-Term Value Creation:** The LTI uses a **3-year performance period** and is explicitly designed to align the Executive Director's remuneration with the company's long-term financial and strategic business objectives, including a focus on operating capital generation and value creation metrics.
3.  **Short-Term Incentives with Strategic and ESG Metrics:** The Short-Term Incentive (STI) is a cash-based annual bonus linked not only to financial outcomes but also to non-financial targets like **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives**, promoting sustainable decision-making.
4.  **Clawback and Risk Control:** The policy includes a provision for the Board to claw back variable compensation already paid in the event of a financial restatement or individual gross misconduct, reinforcing risk management and accountability.

### **Conclusion**

**Management is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, particularly over the long term.**

The company's approach shifts the focus from a high current ownership stake to a **mandatory, high-value, future shareholding requirement (400% of salary)**, which must be built and held through performance shares. This structure forces management to prioritize sustained share price appreciation and financial performance over a multi-year horizon to realize the full value of their compensation, directly aligning their financial future with long-term shareholder returns. The low initial insider ownership is counterbalanced by one of the more stringent mandatory share ownership requirements in the industry.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of Aegon Ltd. (AEG) stock, here is a summary of its price history, technical position, and recent performance drivers. (Note: Prices are based on data from late September 2025.)

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock was recently trading near **$7.95** per share, placing it close to the high end of its 52-week range. The 52-week high is **$8.15**, and the 52-week low is **$5.42**.

2.  **Position Relative to 52-Week Low:** The current stock price of approximately $7.95 is **46.68%** above its 52-week low of $5.42.

3.  **Technical Analysis and "Trading Low":** The stock is **not trading low** based on its annual price history; it is near its 52-week high, indicating a strong recent uptrend. The stock's Moving Averages (EMA10, SMA20, SMA50, and SMA200) were all Bullish, suggesting the stock is in a positive trend, though some short-term indicators and oscillators were Neutral or Bearish.

4.  **Significant Price Increase Explained:** Aegon has been "up bigly" over the past year, reflecting investor confidence in its ongoing transformation and financial performance. A primary driver was the nearly **20% rise in operating profit** for the first half of 2025 (H1 2025).

5.  **Reason for Profit Growth and Turnaround:** The strong operating profit growth was predominantly driven by the better performance of the **protection line within its Americas business**. The company is in the midst of an extensive turnaround program, divesting noncore operations and recycling capital into more stable, "capital-light and more predictable strategic businesses."

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Aegon (AEG) is built on its successful, ongoing transformation from a complex, sprawling European insurer into a focused, highly capitalized financial services group primarily concentrated on the stable and growing US (Transamerica) and UK markets. In the near term, the stock will be driven by management’s consistent delivery on major financial targets, specifically meeting or exceeding the €1.2 billion goal for annual cash flow generation and actively returning this capital to shareholders through large-scale share buybacks and steadily increasing dividends (targeting €0.40 per share). Immediate catalysts include the planned monetization of its large strategic stake in the Dutch company a.s.r., providing a significant cash injection for further buybacks. Long-term, the thesis holds that this simplified structure—focused on sticky, fee-based revenue from retirement and protection products—will significantly de-risk the company's profile. As Aegon reallocates capital away from old, low-growth assets and doubles down on its proprietary US distribution network (WFG agent growth) and its leading UK digital platform, its earnings quality will improve dramatically. This shift to more predictable, higher-return business models will cause the market to re-rate (or value) the stock higher, leading to sustained share price appreciation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull thesis assumes that: 1. **Management Execution is Flawless:** CEO Lard Friese successfully hits the 2025 financial targets (especially cash flow generation) and executes the capital return strategy (dividends and buybacks) as promised. 2. **Financial Markets Remain Cooperative:** There are no catastrophic, sharp downturns in global financial markets that severely damage the value of Aegon's massive investment portfolio or strain its capital reserves. 3. **US Growth Continues:** The growth strategy for the US middle-market, driven by the World Financial Group (WFG) distribution network, continues to accelerate, generating sustained sales and capturing market share. 4. **No Severe Interest Rate Collapse:** Interest rates, particularly in the US, remain at a level that allows Aegon to earn a healthy return on its long-term asset portfolio that exceeds the guaranteed returns owed to policyholders. 5. **Simplification is Rewarded:** The divestments and structural cleanup (like the sale of the a.s.r. stake and the potential HQ relocation) proceed smoothly, and the market rewards the resulting simplified, lower-risk business model with a higher valuation multiple.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several faults and potential holes in the provided bull thesis for Aegon Ltd. (AEG), particularly focusing on the pace of the de-risking strategy, the quality of US growth, and the persistence of embedded, material risks.

## Bear Case Critique: Flaws and Holes in the Long Thesis

1.  **The US Growth Engine (WFG) is Shifting Away from Proprietary Products.**
    The thesis relies on a growing, sticky, fee-based revenue from US distribution (World Financial Group - WFG). However, the WFG agent force, while growing in size, has demonstrated volatility by shifting its sales focus to lucrative **third-party annuity products** in recent quarters, which negatively impacted the sales of Transamerica's own proprietary Individual Life products (Indexed Universal Life). This suggests WFG agents prioritize customer demand and commissions over Transamerica's specific product mix, undermining the "proprietary" and "sticky" growth model assumption.

2.  **Long-Term Care (LTC) Liability Remains an Unaddressed Financial Tail Risk.**
    The narrative of a "highly capitalized, de-risked" group is challenged by Aegon's large, closed block of stand-alone Long-Term Care (LTC) insurance in the US (with IFRS reserves of approximately \$6.5 billion as of late 2022). This legacy block is intrinsically sensitive and "vulnerable to potential reserve increases" if claims experience worsens or if a future period of sustained low interest rates reduces reinvestment yields on its supporting assets, requiring significant future capital injections.

3.  **UK Platform Transformation is a Multi-Year Drag with Ongoing Outflows.**
    The assumption that the UK business is a "leading digital platform" is premature, as the key Adviser platform continues to report substantial net outflows (e.g., £1.54 billion in the first half of 2025) due to industry consolidation and customer withdrawals. Management expects this platform to only achieve positive net flows by the relatively distant target of **2028**, indicating a prolonged, capital-intensive execution period where the drag from outflows offsets the strong performance in the UK Workplace business.

4.  **Cash Flow and Dividend Targets are Susceptible to Legacy Block Volatility.**
    While Aegon is on track to meet the €1.2 billion OCG target, a material portion of this capital generation is derived from the active management and gradual run-off of volatile "Financial Assets" (Variable Annuities with guarantees, Universal Life with Secondary Guarantees, etc.). The underlying capital position remains sensitive to financial markets, and any unforeseen assumption strengthening (such as the recent need to address "adverse policyholder behavior" in the US) can create one-off charges that reduce net earnings and strain the balance sheet, ultimately threatening the perceived quality of the free cash flow and dividend coverage.

5.  **The a.s.r. Stake Monetization is Not a Full "Immediate Catalyst."**
    The bull case cites the "planned monetization" of the a.s.r. stake as an immediate catalyst for large-scale buybacks. However, the majority of the stake (approximately 24% after a partial sale) remains a strategic holding, and Aegon cannot simply liquidate it at will without impacting a.s.r.'s share price or breaching relationship agreements, meaning the full cash injection is a protracted, non-guaranteed event over a multi-year horizon, not an "immediate catalyst".

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the critical next step is to investigate the material risks and conflicting data points from the bear case that directly challenge the core assumptions of the bull thesis.

Here are the most important questions and areas to investigate further:

1.  **Quantify the Long-Term Care (LTC) Financial Risk:** The largest potential surprise is the US Long-Term Care (LTC) legacy block. Investigate the recent investor presentation commentary on this block.
    *   *Question:* What is the **latest reported capital requirement and reserve volatility** for the closed US LTC block, and has management provided a recent update on **de-risking or hedging** this specific liability?

2.  **Assess the Quality of the WFG Distribution Moat:** The bull thesis relies on the World Financial Group (WFG) agent network selling proprietary products, but the bear case suggests a shift to third-party annuities.
    *   *Question:* What are the **current sales trends** (proprietary versus third-party) for **life insurance and annuity products** being distributed by WFG, and is this trend impacting the profitability of Transamerica’s individual life business?

3.  **Verify the Pace and Cost of the UK Transformation:** The bear case highlights the UK Adviser platform is bleeding net outflows until the 2028 target for positive flows.
    *   *Question:* What is the **total multi-year capital investment budget** for the UK digital platform transformation, and what is the current trajectory of **net outflows**—are they accelerating, stable, or decelerating against the 2028 target?

4.  **Clarify the a.s.r. Stake Monetization Timeline:** The ability to return capital hinges on selling the remaining strategic stake in a.s.r.
    *   *Question:* What is the **specific timeline or range** for the sale of the remaining a.s.r. strategic shareholding, and what are the **conditions or lock-up agreements** that prevent the immediate liquidation of the entire stake for buybacks?

5.  **Determine the Status of the US Domicile Change:** The potential relocation of the legal domicile to the US is a major corporate simplification and governance catalyst.
    *   *Question:* What is the **latest update from management or the board** regarding the progress, timeline, and shareholder approval requirements for the planned **relocation of Aegon's legal domicile** to the United States?

6.  **Stress-Test the Operating Capital Generation (OCG) Target:** The bull case hinges on the €1.2 billion OCG target, which partially relies on managing the run-off of volatile "Financial Assets."
    *   *Question:* How much of the **€1.2 billion OCG target** is explicitly derived from the more volatile run-off of **Financial Assets** versus the core, predictable Strategic Assets, and what is the **maximum market shock scenario** Aegon uses to test the stability of this OCG?
