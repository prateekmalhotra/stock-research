## Business Summary

International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC) operates as a global specialty insurance provider. The company's core business model is centered on collecting premiums (money) from commercial clients who require coverage for complex and often high-risk activities, such as energy projects, large ships, or professional liabilities. Customers are businesses (B2B) located across diverse regions, including the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and increasingly Europe and the United States, seeking coverage that standard insurers may not offer. IGIC generates profit primarily in two ways: by making an underwriting profit (where the premiums collected exceed the losses paid out) and by investing the collected premium money (known as the 'float') until claims need to be settled.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for IGIC is exposure to unexpected, large-scale catastrophic events, such as major hurricanes, earthquakes, or large industrial accidents. Because the company specializes in high-value, complex risks globally, a single major event could trigger massive claim payouts that exceed the premiums collected for that year. Historically, events like the September 11 attacks or large tropical storms have caused severe financial strain across the insurance industry, and this threat is increasing now due to growing climate volatility. A key long-term risk relates to underwriting and reserving accuracy; if IGIC consistently misjudges the true risk and charges too little premium, or if it underestimates the necessary funds (reserves) required for future claims, its solvency and market standing will suffer greatly. Furthermore, reliance on global investments means low interest rates or volatile financial markets can significantly diminish the secondary source of income derived from investing the collected premiums.

## Company History

**A History Lesson on International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC)**

International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC) is a global company that provides specialized insurance and reinsurance for unique and complex commercial risks.

### **Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Founding and Origins:** The company was founded in 2001 and began operations in 2002, with its roots tracing back to Amman, Jordan.
2.  **The Founder's Vision:** IGIC was established by Wasef Jabsheh, an insurance industry veteran who wanted to create a company focused on a specific, disciplined strategy.
3.  **Why the Business Was Founded:** The company's goal was to focus on **specialty insurance and reinsurance**, which means insuring unique, complex, and non-standard risks, such as large energy projects, marine vessels, or professional liabilities.
4.  **Targeting the Niche Market:** The founder aimed to avoid general, highly competitive insurance segments (like basic car or home insurance) and instead concentrate on niche areas where deep expertise in **underwriting** (the process of assessing and accepting risk) could generate better profits.

### **From Local Roots to a Global Presence (2002–Present)**

5.  **Initial Growth and Focus:** IGIC started by providing insurance for specific areas like Offshore and Onshore Energy, Property, and Engineering risks, quickly proving its expertise in complex lines of business.
6.  **Early Expansion and Capital:** Operations commenced in 2002, and by 2005, the company successfully raised substantial capital to begin underwriting a reinsurance portfolio, which is essentially "insurance for insurance companies."
7.  **Global Hub Development:** The company strategically expanded its presence to access key global insurance markets; this included establishing a holding company in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) in 2006 and making Bermuda its principal underwriting entity in 2007.
8.  **Entry into the London Market:** A major step was the establishment of a London subsidiary in 2010, which gave IGIC direct access to the London market, one of the most important centers for global specialty insurance.
9.  **Current Global Footprint:** Today, IGIC operates globally across more than 200 countries and markets, with offices in major centers like London, Bermuda, Dubai, Amman, and Casablanca, Morocco.
10. **Going Public:** In March 2020, IGIC achieved a significant milestone by completing a business combination with a U.S.-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), leading its common shares to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol "IGIC."

### **Headwinds (Challenges) and Innovative Solutions**

11. **Headwind: "Soft Market" Pricing:** For many years, the general insurance industry faced a "soft market," where intense competition pushed insurance prices (premiums) down, making it very difficult to maintain high profits.
12. **Innovative Solution: Underwriting Discipline:** IGIC combatted the soft market by maintaining a strict focus on "underwriting profitability," meaning they consistently prioritized making more money from the premiums and claims side of the business than from investments. This disciplined approach involves being selective about which risks they accept and pricing them correctly, leading to a consistently low combined ratio (a key measure of profitability) over time.
13. **Headwind: Catastrophe Claims:** Like all insurers, IGIC faces periods of unexpectedly high claims, often related to large natural or man-made disasters, which can negatively impact their short-term profits.
14. **Solution: Risk Diversification:** The company’s core strategy is to write a diverse portfolio of specialty lines across many different geographies, which helps to spread risk and limit the financial impact of a major event in any single area.

### **Tailwinds (Favorable Market Conditions) and Strategic Moves**

15. **Tailwind: Market Hardening:** The global insurance industry experienced a major **tailwind** as the market began to "harden" (insurance prices rose significantly) just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
16. **Seizing the Opportunity:** IGIC was in a strong financial position to capitalize on this hard market trend, allowing them to expand their portfolio and secure better pricing across nearly all their business segments, which boosted their growth.
17. **Strategic US Expansion:** Capitalizing on the favorable market, the company strategically entered the U.S. Excess & Surplus lines business in 2020, which caters to risks that standard insurers won't cover, further diversifying their income and market reach.
18. **Achieving Financial Strength:** A sign of the company's success is its strong financial ratings—an "A" (Excellent/Strong) from major rating agencies like AM Best and S&P Global Ratings, which is crucial for attracting large commercial clients.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC) is built on its specialized human expertise and a decades-long track record of financial discipline, which creates a powerful barrier to entry in the complex global specialty insurance and reinsurance markets.

Here is an analysis of the company's competitive advantages:

### I. The Moat: Underwriting Discipline and Reputation

1.  **Specialized Underwriting Expertise:** IGIC's primary moat is its ability to write profitable, carefully selected risks across complex lines like energy, property, marine, and financial institutions, often operating in the **excess and surplus (E&S) lines market**. This niche focus requires specialized knowledge to assess and price difficult-to-place risks that standard insurers avoid, giving them a distinct competitive edge.
2.  **Financial Strength and Proven Profitability:** The company consistently demonstrates a "disciplined underwriting philosophy" by maintaining a combined ratio (costs vs. revenues) that has often outperformed industry averages, frequently staying well below the 100% threshold [cite: 1, 2, 6, 11 (from search 1)]. This ability to consistently make a profit from underwriting, even before investment income, shows superior risk management.
3.  **Financial Ratings as a Game-Changer:** A high financial strength rating, such as the recent 'A (Strong)' from S&P, is a massive part of the moat in the insurance and reinsurance industry [cite: 11 (from search 1), 9]. This rating acts as a stamp of approval, assuring clients and counterparties (like brokers and other insurers) that the company can pay out large claims, which is essential for competing in high-margin specialty and treaty reinsurance markets [cite: 11 (from search 1)].

### II. Special Position and Pricing Power

1.  **Market Position in Niche and Complex Risks:** IGIC operates in the specialty and treaty reinsurance space, which is less competitive than standard consumer insurance [cite: 8, 9, 11 (from search 1)]. By taking on "hard-to-place risks," it can command higher premiums.
2.  **Pricing Power from Superior Risk Selection:** The proven track record of superior underwriting (low combined ratio) grants IGIC a form of pricing power, as brokers and clients are willing to pay a premium for stability and the assurance that a reliable, solvent partner is on the other side of the complex contract.
3.  **Expanded "Permission Set":** The upgraded 'A' rating materially widens the company's "permission set" with brokers and allows it to compete for much larger, more complex specialty treaty business, where financial strength is a core requirement [cite: 11 (from search 1)]. This access to exclusive, high-margin segments is a form of differentiation and competitive advantage.

### III. Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk

1.  **Growth Driver: Prioritizing Quality over Quantity:** IGIC's growth has been driven by a deliberate strategy of prioritizing underwriting quality and capital efficiency over chasing top-line revenue [cite: 11 (from search 1)]. It actively engages in "proactive cycle management" by reshaping its portfolio and exiting unprofitable or highly competitive lines of business [cite: 10, 11 (from search 1)].
2.  **Displacement is Difficult:** While an insurer with more capital could theoretically enter the market, it cannot easily displace IGIC. The moat is built on a **decades-long track record** of successful risk analysis and claims payment, which cannot be bought quickly. A new, larger competitor would need to build a similar reputation and gain the trust required for specialty and treaty contracts.

### IV. Customer and Contract Stickiness

1.  **Contracts are Recurring and Relational:** The contracts in specialty insurance and reinsurance are typically annual, but the relationship is recurring and sticky. Switching costs are high because a client (or an insurance company buying reinsurance) must find a new, equally trusted partner to take on their complex, unique risks.
2.  **Stickiness from Trust and Expertise:** Customers are effectively buying IGIC's judgment and financial stability. Once a relationship with a wholesale broker or a specialist client is established based on "focused underwriting expertise" and "responsive claims handling," that relationship tends to persist, creating a steady stream of recurring business.

### V. Moat Creation and Innovation

1.  **Solid Moat Creation Efforts (Human/Process Capital):** The company focuses on a disciplined culture, rigorous employee selection, and maintaining a high-quality, international operating footprint. The recent strategic attainment of the 'A' rating was a deliberate step to solidify the moat by accessing a higher tier of the market [cite: 11 (from search 1)].
2.  **Distribution Network Advantage:** IGIC’s global offices and its presence on platforms like Lloyd’s give it a critical distribution network, providing broad access to specialty intermediaries and a wide geographic spread of risk that diversifies its portfolio [cite: 3, 8, 13 (from search 1)].
3.  **Innovation is in Human Expertise, Not Tech R&D:** The business does not rely on heavy investment in technological R&D in the way a software company would [cite: 1, 11 (from search 1)]. The "edge" comes from the continuous internal innovation of its **underwriting process**—the human capital being constantly trained to assess and price new and emerging complex risks with precision.

## Catalyst Analysis

International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC) catalysts can be broken down into near-term drivers (typically tied to immediate results and capital actions) and long-term drivers (based on structural advantages and sustained strategy).

### Near-Term Stock Price Catalysts

1.  **Continued Exceptional Profitability and Earnings Beats:** The company has a history of reporting a very high core operating Return on Average Equity (ROAE), reaching a company-best of 28.1% for the full year 2023. Continuing to report core operating results far above their long-term average and consistently low combined ratios (profitability measure) should boost investor confidence.
2.  **Share Repurchases and Special Dividends:** Management prioritizes returning excess capital to shareholders, as demonstrated by the new share repurchase authorization and the declaration of a special cash dividend for 2023, in addition to the regular quarterly dividend. These actions signal that the company is undervalued and provides direct shareholder return.
3.  **Increasing Investment Income:** Net investment income has seen significant improvement due to rising interest rates and a larger investment portfolio. Continued favorable interest rate trends and active management of the fixed-income portfolio (maintaining an 'A' credit rating and increasing duration) can continue to add meaningfully to overall profit.

### Long-Term Stock Price Catalysts

1.  **Rating Upgrade and Expanded Business Opportunities:** The recent S&P Global Ratings upgrade of the financial strength rating to 'A' (Strong) with a stable outlook is highlighted by management as integral to future business opportunities. This higher rating can allow IGIC to access larger, more complex, and potentially more profitable lines of business.
2.  **Disciplined Underwriting Strategy and Capital Allocation:** Management's core strategy is to be "underwriting first" and to "shift focus to lines and territories showing the momentum." This disciplined approach involves being selective and *walking away* from business that does not meet their profitability targets, which should lead to sustained high underwriting margins over various market cycles.
3.  **Growth in Specialty Markets (Short-tail and Reinsurance):** The company has been capitalizing on the strong pricing environment and profitable opportunities in the Short-tail (e.g., property, engineering, political violence) and Reinsurance segments. Continued disciplined growth in these specific, higher-margin lines is a key strategic goal.
4.  **Book Value Per Share Growth:** Long-term value creation is tracked by book value per share (BVPS), which grew by nearly 37% in 2023. Continued robust earnings and effective capital deployment, including buybacks, should sustain the growth in BVPS, which is a major driver of stock price appreciation for specialty insurers.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy (Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Strategy Focus:** Management repeatedly emphasizes the consistency of their "focus, discipline, and consistent execution," stating their small size is an advantage that allows them to "move quickly and decisively" to focus on lines and markets with the "highest margins."
*   **Capital Management:** The priority is always underwriting first; however, where there is capital in excess of the opportunity to put to work in underwriting, they will "return it to shareholders" in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
*   **Market Outlook:** Management remains "optimistic" about the profitable opportunities ahead, particularly in their Short-tail lines (property, engineering, political violence) and their treaty reinsurance book, noting that they are seeing a continuation of strong pricing trends.
*   **Outperformance:** They consistently point to their superior results, such as the **highest ever** annual core operating ROAE, as proof of their ability to outperform and deliver superior results even in what is becoming a more competitive marketplace.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings, including the 2024 Form 20-F and recent Information Circulars, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation for International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC).

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensations for IGIC**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** Managers and directors, as a group, have a very high beneficial ownership of the company's shares, reported at approximately **50.89%** as of November 2025.
2.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** This substantial insider ownership, where the management owns over half the company, is one of the strongest indicators that their financial interests are directly aligned with those of all shareholders, as any increase or decrease in share price directly impacts their personal wealth.
3.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Component:** The compensation structure includes discretionary Long-Term Incentives (LTI) in the form of equity (e.g., Restricted Shares) for executive and senior management. The vesting schedules for the CEO's shares extend over multiple years (e.g., 2026, 2027, 2028), promoting a focus on sustained, multi-year share price and company value appreciation rather than short-term gains.
4.  **Performance-Based Short-Term Incentives (STI):** The Short-Term Incentive (STI) component is an annual cash bonus that is discretionary and based on two key factors: the **profitability of the Group** and the **employee's individual performance**.
5.  **Focus on Prudent Risk and Profitability:** The use of "profitability of the Group" as a key metric encourages underwriting discipline and prudent risk-taking, which is essential for creating long-term shareholder value in the insurance sector, as opposed to simply growing premium volume.
6.  **Compensation Mix:** The overall structure balances a fixed basic salary with a significant variable component (STI cash bonus and LTI equity) tied to long-term equity and short-term performance/profitability, which is a widely accepted structure for aligning executive pay with company performance.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

The management of International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. is **incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The exceptionally high insider ownership (over 50%) means that management benefits most when the overall value of the company's stock increases, making it a powerful check against self-serving behavior.
*   The use of multi-year vesting equity (LTI) and annual bonuses tied to Group profitability (STI) reinforces a culture of long-term value creation and disciplined underwriting, which is directly beneficial to all shareholders.

## Long Thesis

International General Insurance (IGIC) is a specialized insurance company focused on insuring complex commercial risks (like energy projects and large ships). Unlike many competitors, IGIC has a decades-long history of being exceptionally good at pricing risk, which means they consistently make high profits from their core business. This discipline is the foundation of the bull case. Near-Term: They are benefiting immensely from the current high-price environment for insurance across their niche markets. Management is using the resulting high cash flow to aggressively buy back their own stock and pay special dividends, which immediately boosts value per share. Long-Term: The recent upgrade to a strong 'A' financial rating acts as a massive competitive advantage, allowing them to enter the highest tier of the global market. This gives them access to larger, more stable, and more profitable specialty contracts. This disciplined, profitable expansion, driven by their reputation and expertise, will continuously increase the company's underlying value (Book Value Per Share) over many years.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that IGIC management maintains its strict underwriting discipline, prioritizing profitability (keeping costs and claims low) over simply increasing the volume of premiums written. We must assume that the global specialty insurance market remains favorable, with prices staying high (a 'hard market') in their specific niche areas (e.g., energy, marine). Furthermore, the thesis assumes IGIC successfully avoids a massive, unforeseen catastrophic event that would wipe out annual profits, which is a constant risk in the insurance sector. Finally, the high level of insider ownership (over 50%) is assumed to continue aligning management's long-term interests directly with those of public shareholders.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the potential holes and faults in the bullish thesis for International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC).

## Bear Case Critique and Identified Flaws

### 1. The Risk of Zero/Negative Growth vs. Valuation
*   **Flaw:** The core strength (underwriting discipline) is simultaneously the main fault (lack of growth). Recent financial reports show a decrease in Gross Written Premiums (GWP) by 5% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a sign of top-line contraction. Investors focused on growth will discount the stock, which is reflected in the company's low "Growth Rank" score (4/10) from some analyst models, contradicting the "continuously increase the company's underlying value" premise for growth investors.

### 2. Underwriting Discipline is Not Infallible or Consistent
*   **Flaw:** The thesis overstates the *consistency* of high profitability. While the long-term combined ratio is excellent (average 87.0%), the combined ratio spiked significantly to 94.4% in Q1 2025 due to elevated losses and catastrophe activity, illustrating vulnerability to large single-quarter losses. Furthermore, management has had to actively exit underperforming books of business, such as certain Professional Indemnity lines, which suggests ongoing underwriting challenges in specific segments, not universal "exceptional" pricing.

### 3. Softening of the "Hard Market" Assumption
*   **Flaw:** The assumption that the "global specialty insurance market remains favorable, with prices staying high (a 'hard market')" is at risk. Management itself noted rate declines in the long-tail segment are finally *slowing* (not stopping), and the decrease in GWP is a direct signal that the company is struggling to find enough profitable business at the current high prices. Broader industry data also suggests global insurance rates are moderating, signaling a possible end to the peak pricing environment.

### 4. Capital Return Strategy is Dependent and Volatile
*   **Flaw:** The idea of "aggressively buy back... and pay **special** dividends" is not a consistent, guaranteed return. The high-return special dividends are contingent on current-year profits and can be unpredictable. The primary, *guaranteed* quarterly dividend is small (\$0.05 per share). The share repurchases are positive but may be viewed as a necessary use of capital to offset market concerns over the falling top-line premium volume.

### 5. High Insider Ownership and Governance Risk
*   **Fault:** While insider ownership (over 50%) is assumed to align interests, it also creates a significant structural risk. This level of control means the company is effectively a "controlled company," limiting the influence of minority shareholders. This high concentration of power can pose governance concerns and could lead to decisions (e.g., M&A, related-party transactions) that prioritize the control group over public shareholder value.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGIC)

**IGIC is a structurally constrained, ex-growth insurer whose premium valuation reflects its inability to consistently scale its superior underwriting results, leaving it highly vulnerable to cyclical downturns and single-quarter catastrophe events.**

1.  **Top-Line Contraction and Valuation Ceiling:** Management's deliberate strategy to prioritize underwriting discipline above all else has resulted in negative premium growth (GWP decline of 5% in Q3 2025), which is a clear headwind for a public company. The market will likely cap IGIC's valuation at a lower price-to-book multiple than true growth peers, regardless of its exceptional Return on Equity (ROE).
2.  **Imminent Cyclical Softening:** The assumed "hard market" is already showing signs of cracking, with IGIC experiencing top-line strain and exiting entire business lines due to rate inadequacy. As the pricing cycle inevitably turns further against insurers, IGIC's current high profitability will be squeezed, and its combined ratio will deteriorate from its recent excellent levels, which the 'A' rating will not prevent.
3.  **Underestimated Catastrophe & Loss Risk:** The recent spike in the Q1 2025 combined ratio to 94.4% proves that IGIC's focused, niche specialty portfolio is still susceptible to large, volatile loss events, which can erase the benefit of multiple quarters of disciplined underwriting. The company must constantly overcome this volatility to prove its long-term consistency.
