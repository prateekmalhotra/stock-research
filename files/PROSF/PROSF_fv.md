This valuation of Prosus N.V. (PROSF) is conducted using a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) methodology, combining a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis for its rapidly growing, consolidated e-commerce assets with a Mark-to-Market valuation for its substantial stake in Tencent and other liquid assets. All figures are in US dollars (US$).

## **Part 1: Balance Sheet and Asset Value (Current Assets & Debt)**

### **A. Liquid Assets and Debt (as of March 31, 2024)**

Data is sourced from the Prosus N.V. Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (FY24).

| Item | Value (US$ Millions) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $2,175 | Consolidated Statement of Financial Position figure. |
| **Short-Term Investments** | $13,834 | Considered highly liquid and in-hand cash for valuation purposes. |
| **Total Liquid Assets** | **$16,009** | Sum of Cash and Short-Term Investments. |
| **Long-Term Liabilities (Debt Proxy)** | $15,739 | Long-term liabilities, mostly bonds and loans. |
| **Current Portion of Debt** | $472 | Current portion of long-term liabilities. |
| **Total Debt** | **$16,211** | Conservative proxy for total borrowings. |
| **Net Cash / (Debt)** | **($202)** | Total Liquid Assets - Total Debt. |

### **B. Mark-to-Market Value of Listed Associates (Tencent Stake)**

Prosus's primary asset is its investment in Tencent Holdings Ltd. (TCEHY/0700.HK).

| Item | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tencent Shares Held (Estimated)** | $2.36$ billion shares | Based on a January 2024 disclosure, which is a recent high-precision figure. |
| **Tencent Share Price** | $68.30$ (TCEHY) | Based on a recent market price (Feb 13, 2026). |
| **Tencent Stake Market Value** | **$161.42 Billion** | ($2.36 \text{ billion shares} \times $68.30 \text{/share}$) |
| **Tencent Stake Discount** | $-30\%$ | A conservative assumption. While the buyback program aims to reduce the *holding company discount* from historical levels, a significant discount remains a reality for holding companies, especially those with geopolitical risks (China). |
| **Mark-to-Market Value (Adjusted)** | **$113.00 Billion** | ($161.42 \text{ billion} \times 0.70$) |

**Note on Unlisted Assets:** The consolidated balance sheet lists **Investments in associates** at **$35.93 billion** (March 31, 2024, which primarily includes Tencent but also other significant minority stakes like Delivery Hero, Meituan, etc.). By using a mark-to-market valuation for Tencent and performing a DCF on the Core Business, we implicitly value the remainder of the minority investments (e.g., Delivery Hero, Meituan) within the consolidated entities or assume they are covered by the conservative discount applied to Tencent. For conservatism, we only explicitly value the liquid Tencent stake plus the DCF of the core operations.

## **Part 2: DCF for Core E-commerce Business**

The Core E-commerce business is Prosus's operating arm (Food Delivery, Classifieds, Payments & Fintech, Edtech). Management has guided this business to profitability ahead of schedule, marking a significant inflection point.

### **A. Business Engine and Revenue/Margin Assumptions**

**Business Engine: Shift to Profitable Growth**
The engine is driven by a decisive shift from investing for market share (peak investment in FY23) to *profitable growth* and capital discipline. Management's commitment to achieving profitability ahead of schedule is a key factor.

*   **Metric of Focus:** **Adjusted EBITDA (aEBITDA) / Adjusted EBIT (aEBIT)**, which management guides to and focuses on.
*   **FY24 Base:** Consolidated Revenue: $5.5$B; Consolidated aEBIT: $38$M.
*   **FY25 Guidance (Conservative Anchor):** Consolidated Revenue: $6.2$B; Consolidated aEBIT: $400$M.
*   **FY26 Guidance (Conservative Anchor):** Adjusted EBITDA (aEBITDA) of **$1.1B - $1.2B**. We will use the lower end of the range, **$1.1$B**, as the anchor for FY26.
*   **Long-Term Goal:** "Couple billion dollars of profits in the next few years".

| Year (FY ending Mar 31) | Revenue (US$ M) | YoY Growth % | Net Income Margin % | Net Income (US$ M) | Rationale/Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 5,500 | $11\%$ | $\sim 0.7\%$ (aEBIT $38M) | N/A | Base year. |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | 6,200 | $12.7\%$ | $6.45\%$ (aEBIT $400M) | $400$ | Using management's stated aEBIT guidance of $400$M. |
| **2026 (Guidance)** | 7,130 | $15.0\%$ | $15.4\%$ | $1,100$ | Revenue growth slows slightly, but profitability scales dramatically from aEBITDA guidance of $1.1$B. Assumes aEBITDA $\approx$ Net Income (as the business is still early in profit maturity). |
| **2027** | 8,200 | $15.0\%$ | $17.1\%$ | $1,400$ | Conservative 15% revenue growth; Margin expands towards the "couple billion dollars" long-term goal. |
| **2028** | 9,300 | $13.4\%$ | $18.3\%$ | $1,700$ | Revenue growth conservatively slows to $\sim 13\%$; Margin expansion continues. |
| **2029** | 10,400 | $11.8\%$ | $19.2\%$ | $2,000$ | Reaching the low end of the "couple billion" profit goal. |
| **2030** | 11,500 | $10.6\%$ | $20.0\%$ | $2,300$ | Conservative 10% terminal-like growth; Maturing margin at $20\%$. |

### **B. ROIC and Net Income Final Calculation**

We will now apply the principle that Net Income from the prior year generates additional income via Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Since the Core business has only recently achieved profitability and the past two years' Internal Rate of Return (IRR) has been "far below target", we must use a conservative, forward-looking positive ROIC. A conservative assumption of **$5\%$** is used, reflecting a disciplined capital allocation strategy on the newly generated profits.

$$
\text{Projected Net Income}_t = \text{Base Net Income}_t + (\text{Net Income}_{t-1} \times \text{ROIC})
$$

| Year | Base Net Income (US$ M) | + ROIC (5%) Income (US$ M) | Final Net Income (US$ M) / DCF Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $400$ | $0$ | **$400$** |
| **2026** | $1,100$ | $20$ | **$1,120** |
| **2027** | $1,400$ | $56$ | **$1,456** |
| **2028** | $1,700$ | $73$ | **$1,773** |
| **2029** | $2,000$ | $89$ | **$2,089** |
| **2030** | $2,300$ | $104$ | **$2,404** |

### **C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative rate of **$10\%$** is used, reflecting high growth/high risk in the emerging markets and tech sector where Prosus primarily operates.
*   **Maturity (Terminal) Rate:** A very conservative long-term growth rate of **$3.0\%$** is used.

**Terminal Value (TV) (from 2031 onwards):**
$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{2,404 \times (1 + 0.03)}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{2,476}{0.07} = $35,371 \text{ Million}
$$

| Year | DCF Cash Flow (US$ M) | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value (US$ M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $400$ | $0.909$ | $364$ |
| **2026** | $1,120$ | $0.826$ | $926$ |
| **2027** | $1,456$ | $0.751$ | $1,093$ |
| **2028** | $1,773$ | $0.683$ | $1,211$ |
| **2029** | $2,089$ | $0.621$ | $1,297$ |
| **2030 (Operating)** | $2,404$ | $0.564$ | $1,355$ |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | $35,371$ | $0.564$ | $19,935$ |
| **Total NPV of Core Business** | | | **$26,181$ Million** |

## **Part 3: Final Valuation and Market Comparison**

### **A. Fair Value Calculation (Sum-of-the-Parts)**

| Component | Value (US$ Millions) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Mark-to-Market Tencent Stake (30% Discount)** | $113,000$ | Market value of $161.42B with a $30\%$ holding company discount. |
| **B. NPV of Core E-commerce Business (DCF)** | $26,181$ | Total NPV of the operating businesses until maturity. |
| **C. Net Cash / (Debt)** | ($202$) | Total Liquid Assets ($16,009$M) - Total Debt ($16,211$M). |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$138,979** | Sum (A + B + C). |
| **Shares Outstanding (N Shares)** | $12.963 \text{ Billion}$ | Used FY24 figure for conservatism, as buybacks continue. |
| **Fair Value Per Share (US$)** | **$10.72** | $138,979 \text{M} / 12,963 \text{M shares}$ |

### **B. Market Comparison and Justification**

*   **Current Stock Price (PROSF):** Approximately **$6.20 USD** (Note: As of the current day, based on an assumed market price for the valuation timeframe).
*   **Fair Value Per Share:** **$10.72 USD**

**Justification for Discrepancy (Market Discount)**

The calculated Fair Value of **$10.72** is significantly higher (over **$4.50** difference) than the current market price of $6.20$. This suggests the market is making a different set of assumptions, which is typical for Prosus due to its nature as a holding company.

1.  **Higher Holding Company Discount:** The market is likely applying a much higher discount to the Tencent stake than the $30\%$ assumed in this model. A market price of $6.20$ implies a combined discount of over **$55\%$** on the Tencent stake alone, or an expectation of *zero* value for the core e-commerce business.
    *   *Calculation:* $(\$161.42B \text{ Tencent Value} - \$0.20B \text{ Net Debt}) / 12.963B \text{ shares} = \$12.44 \text{ per share}$. The market price of $\$6.20$ is approximately $50\%$ of this NAV.
    *   **Conclusion:** The market is pricing in a **$50\%$ holding company discount** for the total NAV (Tencent + Net Cash).

2.  **Skepticism on Core E-commerce Profitability:** The market is discounting the future cash flows of the Core E-commerce business, believing that either the growth will be lower, the margins will not reach $20\%$, or that capital expenditure (CapEx not accounted for in this simple Net Income DCF) will consume most of the operating cash flow. This model is based directly on management's stated guidance and profitability inflection point (aEBIT $400M in FY25, aEBITDA $1.1B in FY26).

3.  **The Buyback Program:** Prosus's core strategy is to narrow this discount via an open-ended share repurchase program funded by sales of Tencent shares, which has reduced the free-float share count by $21\%$ since inception. **This DCF does not fully account for the accretive value of the ongoing, aggressive buyback**, which will reduce the final denominator (shares outstanding) over time. This makes the $10.72$ valuation potentially *conservative* if the buyback continues effectively.

**Summary Justification for Fair Value of $10.72:**

The valuation is high because it places a conservative but tangible value (NPV of $26.18B$) on a newly profitable and guided-to-high-EBITDA Core E-commerce business, *in addition* to the liquid, discounted Tencent stake. The market is effectively assigning a near-zero value to the Core E-commerce business or a massive discount to the entire entity, ignoring management's clear guidance on accelerating profitability and the value created by the active share repurchase program. **The $10.72$ Fair Value represents an investment case where Prosus successfully executes on its stated profitability targets for its core assets and continues to narrow its historic holding company discount.**
