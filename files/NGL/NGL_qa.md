## Business Summary

NGL Energy Partners LP operates primarily in the U.S. energy midstream sector, serving major and independent oil and gas companies (B2B customers) located geographically across major U.S. drilling regions like the Permian Basin. Its core business is the Water Solutions segment, where it collects, treats, and disposes of the massive volumes of wastewater created during oil and gas production, generating stable, fee-based revenue for this essential service. The company also earns fees by transporting, storing, and selling crude oil and refined products like gasoline and diesel through its network of terminals and pipelines, focusing on earning fees based on volume and providing logistical support to producers.

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk for NGL is its high level of debt. Because the company owes significant amounts, a large portion of its earnings must go toward interest payments, and if credit markets tighten, refinancing existing obligations becomes difficult and expensive, potentially hurting its financial stability. A critical long-term risk stems from its dependence on crude oil volumes: while the company earns fees, the amount of wastewater it processes or crude oil it transports relies entirely on how much drilling its customers are doing. If oil prices crash, as they have in the past (notably 2015 and 2020), drilling activity slows down immediately, leading to lower volumes and sharply reduced revenues for NGL. This volume risk is a constant cause for concern because the energy industry remains highly cyclical and susceptible to global economic pressures.

## Company History

This history of NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL) is organized chronologically, explaining its business in simple terms.

### **The Founding and Early Strategy (2010 - 2014)**

1.  **Inception and Core Goal:** NGL Energy Partners LP was established in 2010 as a "midstream" energy company. Its fundamental goal was to move, store, and process oil, gas, and related products from where they are produced to where they are sold.

2.  **Initial Business Model:** The business was built through a rapid series of acquisitions, combining different energy assets across the United States. These assets initially focused on two main areas: **Crude Oil Logistics** (transporting crude oil) and **Liquids Logistics** (handling natural gas liquids like propane and butane).

3.  **A Pivotal Strategic Addition:** Early on, the company also began building a **Water Solutions** segment. This was a key differentiator focused on the increasing problem of managing the massive amounts of wastewater ("produced water") that comes up with oil and gas during the U.S. shale boom.

4.  **Tailwind: The Shale Boom:** The surge in U.S. shale oil and gas drilling provided a major business advantage (a "tailwind"). Because drillers needed constant, reliable services to move their product and dispose of their wastewater, NGL's business benefited from guaranteed volumes and steady fees, which were typically more stable than the price of crude oil itself.

### **The Great Headwind and Major Problems (2014 - 2020)**

5.  **Headwind: The Commodity Crash:** The oil price crash that began in 2014 severely challenged the energy sector. While NGL's midstream services were fee-based, the industry downturn strained the finances of their producer customers and created general economic uncertainty.

6.  **The Debt Problem:** To fund its fast growth through acquisitions, NGL accumulated a large amount of debt, which became its biggest problem (a major "headwind"). High debt levels made the company very vulnerable to any dip in cash flow and led to concerns about meeting upcoming loan payments.

7.  **Focus Shift: Survival and Deleveraging:** In response to the financial strain, the company had to shift its focus from rapid growth to financial stability. Their new goal became simple: reduce the massive debt load, simplify the business, and delay the maturity dates of their loans to buy more time.

### **Innovative Solutions and Modern Transformation (2020 - Present)**

8.  **Innovative Solution: The Water Solutions Dominance:** The long-term investment in the Water Solutions segment became the company's "crown jewel" and key to its survival. This segment provides a critical, non-negotiable service—handling and disposing of wastewater—which makes it a stable, fee-based revenue source that is essential regardless of oil price volatility.

9.  **The New Business Focus:** Water Solutions now represents the overwhelming majority of the company's operating earnings (as much as 92% of its core profits, or Adjusted EBITDA). NGL operates one of the largest systems for collecting, treating, and disposing of produced water, primarily in key drilling areas like the Permian Basin, using over 800 miles of large pipelines.

10. **Financial Solutions to Headwinds:** To tackle its high debt, NGL executed a significant financial turnaround:
    *   **Strategic Asset Sales:** They sold off non-core parts of the business (like marine assets and some oil and gas logistics terminals) to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in cash.
    *   **Debt Refinancing:** The cash from these sales, combined with strong earnings from Water Solutions, was used to pay down debt and, more importantly, refinance billions in debt to push the final payment deadlines years into the future (e.g., to 2029 and 2032), removing the immediate threat of default.

11. **Current Goal and Outlook:** NGL has successfully transformed from a diversified energy company to a focused **water infrastructure specialist** for the energy industry. Its current goal is to continue using the stable cash flow from Water Solutions to aggressively pay down its remaining debt, improve its balance sheet, and position itself for long-term growth by investing in its core, fee-based water business.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of NGL Energy Partners LP is primarily an **infrastructure-based moat** centered on its dominant position in the produced water management sector, a mission-critical and highly regulated part of the oil and gas industry.

Here is an analysis of NGL's competitive advantages:

### The Core Moat: Integrated Infrastructure and Scale

1.  **Largest Integrated Water Network:** NGL operates the largest integrated network of large-diameter wastewater pipelines, disposal wells, and produced water handling systems in the critical Delaware Basin, a high-growth area of the Permian Basin.
2.  **High Barrier to Entry:** The company's competitive advantage is rooted in this extensive, fixed infrastructure. Building an equivalent network—which requires massive capital investment, lengthy permitting processes, securing land rights-of-way, and regulatory approval—creates a significant hurdle for new competitors.
3.  **Economies of Scale in Water Disposal:** The sheer scale of its operations allows NGL to achieve operational efficiencies, such as a reduction in operating expenses per barrel of water processed. This cost advantage can provide a competitive edge in pricing or allow for higher profit margins compared to smaller, less integrated operators.

### Customer Stickiness and Pricing Power

4.  **Sticky, Long-Term Contracts:** A major factor for revenue stability is the customer base in the Water Solutions segment, where over 90% of disposal volume is committed through **acreage dedications and Minimum Volume Commitments (MVCs)**. These long-term contracts, with an average remaining life of approximately 9 to 10 years, guarantee a reliable, recurring revenue stream.
5.  **Investment-Grade Customer Base:** Approximately 80% of NGL's total disposal volumes come from investment-grade counterparties, indicating a stable and financially secure customer base, which reduces the risk of contract default.
6.  **De Facto Pricing Power:** While the market is competitive, the critical nature of water disposal—it is a non-negotiable operational necessity for oil and gas production—gives the infrastructure an inherent value. By having an integrated, efficient system, NGL can exercise pricing discipline, especially in combination with its long-term, committed volumes.

### Differentiation from Competitors

7.  **Focus on Water as a Utility:** Unlike many diversified competitors that may view water as a secondary service, NGL has strategically positioned its Water Solutions segment as the primary growth engine and core business, contributing a significant majority of its total EBITDA.
8.  **Vertical Integration:** The company offers an end-to-end service, managing water from the wellhead through pipelines to disposal, recycling, or discharge facilities. This integration enhances customer service and operational efficiency, making NGL a convenient, full-service provider.
9.  **Early Focus on Pipeline Transportation:** NGL's infrastructure emphasizes large-diameter pipelines over trucking for water transport. Pipelines are significantly more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient for high volumes, creating a superior and more difficult-to-replicate logistics solution for producers.

### Displacement Risk, Growth, and Innovation

10. **Difficult to Displace:** Displacement by a competitor with more capital is difficult but not impossible. The sheer cost of replicating NGL's vast, strategically located pipeline and well infrastructure is a massive hurdle. A new player would face the "first-mover" disadvantage of having to build from scratch against an established, integrated network.
11. **Historical Growth Driver:** The company grew into what it is today through a strategy of **accretive growth via strategic acquisitions and consolidation** in the energy sector, coupled with organic growth by continually investing in and expanding its core asset base, especially within the Water Solutions segment.
12. **Innovation and R&D:** While the core moat is infrastructure, NGL does invest in **proprietary water innovations** and has technical experts focused on produced water research. This ensures they can offer recycling and reuse services, which is increasingly important to meet producer sustainability goals and manage environmental risks, adding a layer of service differentiation to their physical infrastructure.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings (DEF 14A/Proxy Statements) and insider data, the management incentive and compensation structure for NGL Energy Partners LP presents a mixed conclusion regarding the alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership (High Alignment)**

*   **Significant Total Insider Ownership:** Insiders, including directors and managers, own a very high percentage of the company, with aggregate insider ownership at approximately **32.98%**. This level of ownership is highly favorable, as the personal wealth of the management is directly tied to the unit price and overall value of the company, strongly aligning their interests with those of the common shareholders ("higher the better").
*   **Key Executive Holdings:** The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), H. Michael Krimbill, directly owns a significant stake, approximately **3.9%** of the company's shares.
*   **Net Buying Activity:** There has been reported net insider buying over the last 12 months, which indicates confidence in the company's future performance by those who manage it.

#### **2. Compensation Structure (Potential Misalignment)**

*   **Cash-Heavy Pay for Most Executives:** Proxy data for the most recent fiscal years (2024/2025) shows that the majority of named executives, *excluding* the CEO, received little to **no new equity awards** ("Stock Award Value" or "Option Award Value" of $0) in the compensation period.
*   **Focus on Annual Cash Bonus:** This structure suggests that the bulk of these executives' variable compensation comes from **cash bonuses** and "Non-Equity Incentive Compensation" (Total Cash Comp). This type of annual incentive can encourage short-term, year-over-year performance achievements, rather than long-term strategic decisions that create sustained unit value.
*   **CEO Compensation Mix:** The CEO's total compensation is heavily weighted toward performance-based pay, with approximately **72.4%** consisting of bonuses and stock/option awards, while salary accounts for about **27.6%**. However, the zero-equity grant to other top executives weakens the long-term equity alignment across the rest of the leadership team.

#### **3. Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

*   **Strong Long-Term Alignment from Ownership:** The **high level of total insider ownership** acts as a powerful incentive to act in the shareholders' long-term interest, as management and directors stand to lose a substantial portion of their net worth if the unit price declines.
*   **Weak Incentive from Annual Grants:** The near-total lack of new **equity awards** for non-CEO executives suggests the structure does not consistently foster a culture of long-term unit price appreciation. The high reliance on annual cash bonuses may incentivize short-term earnings management over long-term shareholder value creation.
*   **Overall Assessment:** Management has a strong **incentive to protect its existing shareholder value** due to its substantial holdings, but the **compensation structure for *new* annual pay** for most executives is heavily weighted toward cash and may encourage short-term focus.

## Long Thesis

NGL has successfully transformed from a messy, highly leveraged energy company into a focused, stable, and essential water utility provider for the largest oil field in the U.S. (the Permian Basin). The bullish case is that NGL's core business, the Water Solutions segment, provides predictable, fee-based revenue from irreplaceable infrastructure, which it is now aggressively using to fix its major historical problem: high debt. In the near term, record-breaking water volumes and cash from asset sales are reducing leverage and strengthening the balance sheet. In the long term, new contracts and system expansions will push company earnings significantly higher (management projects earnings over $700 million by 2027). Once the balance sheet is clean, the market will re-rate the stock, valuing the company as a stable, infrastructure-based utility, leading to significant unit price appreciation and the potential return of capital to shareholders.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The underlying assumptions required for the bull case to materialize are: 1. **Continued Drilling Activity:** Oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin must continue drilling at current or higher levels for the next five years, ensuring high volumes of wastewater flow through NGL's system. 2. **Successful Debt Execution:** Management must successfully use operational cash flow and asset sale proceeds to pay down debt, address the preferred units, and avoid costly refinancing issues. 3. **Contract Stability:** Customers (many of whom are investment-grade) must honor their long-term contracts and Minimum Volume Commitments, providing guaranteed revenue stability. 4. **Infrastructure Dominance:** NGL must maintain its competitive advantage, as its integrated water pipeline network remains the most cost-effective solution for producers, preventing new competition from displacing it.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the holes and faults in the long thesis by focusing on the hidden risks in the company's capital structure, the competitive challenges to its core business, and the likelihood of its promised valuation re-rating.

## Bear Case Thesis for NGL Energy Partners LP (NGL)

The bull case significantly underestimates the execution risk of the company's precarious capital structure and the looming threat of industry trends that could undermine its core business model before the balance sheet is truly "clean."

### Flaws and Faults in the Bull Thesis

1.  **Overwhelming and Urgent Preferred Debt Risk Undermines Deleveraging:** The aggressive debt reduction narrative is severely hampered by the **Class D preferred units** (estimated obligation up to \$600 million), which give unitholders the right to force redemption in early Fiscal 2028. This potential **"put" obligation** requires a large, unscheduled cash outflow, consuming operational cash flow and asset sale proceeds that the bull thesis assumes will be used to reduce the overall debt principal and clean the balance sheet.

2.  **High EBITDA Does Not Translate to Material Common Unit Earnings/Distributions:** Management’s fiscal 2027 Adjusted EBITDA projection of at least \$700 million is misleading for common unitholders. With approximately \$2.9 billion in total debt, high interest expenses will consume a significant portion of that operating cash flow, leaving analyst estimates for actual Net Earnings (E) in 2027 closer to just over \$60 million. This massive gap between EBITDA and Net Income makes the return of a substantial common unit distribution highly unlikely until well after the 2029 debt maturity is addressed, potentially delaying the return of capital until 2029 or later.

3.  **Core Disposal Business Faces Structural Headwinds from Recycling:** The assumption of "irreplaceable infrastructure" is challenged by the Permian's rapid pivot to water reuse and recycling. Industry data indicates that as much as **78% of produced water is currently being reused by operators,** and some projections suggest recycling could account for up to **80% of frack water by 2030.** This accelerating trend—driven by major producers like ExxonMobil and a focus on ESG—will cannibalize the market for NGL’s primary Saltwater Disposal (SWD) volumes, making its growth increasingly dependent on lower-margin recycling or new high-CapEx infrastructure builds.

4.  **Valuation Re-Rating Is Blocked by High Leverage:** The notion that the market will re-rate NGL as a "stable, infrastructure-based utility" is premature and unrealistic given its capital structure. The company's high debt-to-equity ratio (approx. 4.95) and current **EV/EBITDA multiple (6.5x-7.7x)** are already high for a highly leveraged entity. The market will only assign a lower-risk, utility-like multiple once the leverage ratio is materially lower than the current projected 4.0x (Fiscal 2026 guidance), which will take years of cash-intensive debt paydown, and high interest expense remains a persistent drag on Net Income valuation.

5.  **Execution Risk and Prioritization of Capital is Flawed:** Management's decision to use operational cash flow to repurchase common units (a "risk-on" strategy) instead of aggressively prioritizing the reduction of total debt principal and the elimination of the Class D preferred liability introduces unnecessary risk. This focus risks forcing a more expensive or dilutive financial solution if a market downturn slows volume growth and tightens capital markets before the 2028 and 2029 maturities are fully resolved.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the bull and bear cases, the most critical unanswered questions revolve around the company's financial structure, the true extent of the water recycling threat, and the target valuation.

Here are the next steps you should investigate:

### I. Quantify the Debt Risk and Management's Solution

1.  **Determine the *True* Cost of the Preferred Units:** The analysis identifies the Class D preferred units as a $\sim\$600 million problem in early Fiscal 2028. Investigate management's detailed plan for addressing this redemption risk, specifically how much they have redeemed to date, the size of the tranches, and whether they plan to use cash or common unit conversion to resolve the remaining obligation.
2.  **Calculate the Net Cash Flow Impact:** Model the exact cash outflow for preferred unit distributions and compare it to the projected interest expense from the existing term loan debt. This will help quantify the actual cash available to pay down the principal debt and the $300 million shortfall estimated in the bear case.
3.  **Validate the Interest Rate Savings:** Confirm the precise financial impact of the recent Term Loan B repricing (which management reports has reduced the SOFR margin and is saving approximately $\$$15 million annually) to ensure this saving is fully accounted for in cash flow projections.

### II. Assess the Water Recycling/Disposal Transition

4.  **Quantify the Recycling Volume and Revenue:** The analysis notes a major structural risk from producers shifting to water recycling. Determine the actual percentage of NGL's total water volume that is currently dedicated to recycling/reuse services versus traditional saltwater disposal (SWD).
5.  **Analyze the Profitability of Recycling vs. Disposal:** Investigate how the fee structure and margin of recycling services (selling water for reuse) compare to the traditional fee-based disposal business. If recycling has materially lower margins, the shift could cannibalize overall profitability even if volumes remain high.
6.  **Evaluate the XRI Collaboration Impact:** Analyze the specifics and commercial terms of NGL's collaboration with XRI Holdings (a large recycling company) to understand if this partnership is a defensive move to capture recycling revenue or a simple revenue-sharing agreement with a competitor.

### III. Refine the Target Valuation Multiple

7.  **Identify Current Pure-Play Water Midstream Multiples:** Search for the current EV/EBITDA multiples for direct, pure-play public competitors in the water midstream space, such as Aris Water Solutions (ARIS), to establish a credible target multiple if NGL successfully deleverages.
8.  **Contextualize Transaction Multiples:** Use historical transaction data for water asset sales to gauge what a private buyer (like a private equity firm) is paying for comparable water infrastructure, which can provide an alternative perspective on the asset's intrinsic value.
