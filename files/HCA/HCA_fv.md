### **2. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projection**

HCA's business engine is driven primarily by four factors, as noted in management commentary:
1.  **Broad-based volume growth** (admissions, equivalent admissions, and emergency room visits).
2.  **Improved payer mix** (favorable shift in payor mix).
3.  **Higher utilization of complex services** (more profitable services).
4.  **Additional revenue from Medicaid supplemental programs.**

*   **2024 Performance:** Revenue grew 8.7%, driven by a 5.3% rise in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission.
*   **2025 Guidance:** Management guided full-year 2025 revenue to a midpoint of **\$75.75 billion**.
*   **Long-Term View:** Management has indicated that 2025 volume growth (3% to 4%) is near or slightly above the upper end of their **long-term growth range**. This suggests that a long-term total revenue growth rate should be moderated.

**Revenue Projections Justification (2026-2030):**
A conservative long-term growth rate must reflect the base growth from volume and the incremental growth from price/mix, while being mindful of the "long-term growth range" being around 4%. The initial 2024 growth was high due to post-pandemic recovery and favorable utilization. For conservatism, the long-term growth will be set at **5.0%** per year, which is a moderate combination of:
*   *Volume Growth (Admissions/Equivalents):* ~2.5% - 3.0% (in-line with historical and management's long-term view).
*   *Pricing/Service Mix Growth:* ~2.0% - 2.5% (moderated from 2024's 3.2% to account for conservative payor-mix normalization and regulatory pressure).

| Year | Revenue (USD Billions) | Year-over-Year Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | **\$75.75** | 7.3% (Implied from 2024 \$70.603B) | Management Guidance Midpoint. |
| **2026 (P)** | **\$79.54** | 5.0% | Conservative long-term growth assumption. |
| **2027 (P)** | **\$83.52** | 5.0% | Conservative long-term growth assumption. |
| **2028 (P)** | **\$87.69** | 5.0% | Conservative long-term growth assumption. |
| **2029 (P)** | **\$92.08** | 5.0% | Conservative long-term growth assumption. |
| **2030 (P)** | **\$96.68** | 5.0% | Conservative long-term growth assumption. |

### **3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Projection**

#### **Net Income Margin Assumption**

*   **2025 Net Income Margin (Implied):** (\$6.61 B Midpoint) / (\$75.75 B Midpoint) = **8.73%**.
*   **Long-Term Margin:** The Net Margin for Q2 2025 was 8.9%, and the LTM margin was 8.53%. Management noted that disciplined cost controls and operational execution are contributing to stronger operating margins. We will use the 2025 guidance implied margin and conservatively taper it slightly to a stable, long-term margin of **8.50%** for 2028-2030, reflecting sustained operating efficiency with an allowance for potential cost or regulatory headwinds.

#### **Projected Net Income Calculation**

The Net Income projection incorporates the rule: **Net Income (t) = (Revenue (t) * Net Income Margin (t)) + (Net Income (t-1) * ROIC)**, where the previous year's net income acts as the "cash" available for reinvestment. We use a conservative ROIC of **16.0%**.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Inc. Margin (B) | Net Income from Operations (A*B) | Prior Net Inc. * ROIC (C) | **Projected Net Income (A*B + C)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (A)** | \$70.60 | 8.16% | \$5.76 | N/A | \$5.76 |
| **2025 (P)** | \$75.75 | 8.73% | \$6.61 | (\$5.76 * 16.0%) = \$0.92 | **\$7.53** |
| **2026 (P)** | \$79.54 | 8.65% | \$6.88 | (\$7.53 * 16.0%) = \$1.21 | **\$8.09** |
| **2027 (P)** | \$83.52 | 8.58% | \$7.17 | (\$8.09 * 16.0%) = \$1.29 | **\$8.46** |
| **2028 (P)** | \$87.69 | 8.50% | \$7.45 | (\$8.46 * 16.0%) = \$1.35 | **\$8.80** |
| **2029 (P)** | \$92.08 | 8.50% | \$7.83 | (\$8.80 * 16.0%) = \$1.41 | **\$9.24** |
| **2030 (P)** | \$96.68 | 8.50% | \$8.22 | (\$9.24 * 16.0%) = \$1.48 | **\$9.70** |

#### **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The projected Net Income is treated as the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

**1. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of Explicit Forecast Period (2025-2030)**
We use a conservative Discount Rate of **8.0%**.

| Year | Projected Net Income (FCFE) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.08)^n) | **NPV of FCFE** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$7.53 B | 0.9259 | \$6.97 B |
| **2026** | \$8.09 B | 0.8573 | \$6.94 B |
| **2027** | \$8.46 B | 0.7938 | \$6.72 B |
| **2028** | \$8.80 B | 0.7350 | \$6.47 B |
| **2029** | \$9.24 B | 0.6806 | \$6.29 B |
| **2030** | \$9.70 B | 0.6302 | \$6.11 B |
| **Total NPV of Explicit FCFE** | | | **\$39.50 Billion** |

**2. Calculate Terminal Value (TV)**
Using the conservative Perpetual Growth Model:

TV at end of 2030 = [FCFE (2030) * (1 + g)] / (Discount Rate - g)
TV at end of 2030 = [\$9.70 B * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.08 - 0.025)
TV at end of 2030 = \$9.94 B / 0.055
**TV at end of 2030 = \$180.73 Billion**

**3. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value**

NPV of TV = TV (2030) * Discount Factor (2030)
NPV of TV = \$180.73 B * 0.6302
**NPV of TV = \$113.90 Billion**

**4. Calculate Total Equity Value**

Total Equity Value = NPV of Explicit FCFE + NPV of TV - Net Debt
Net Debt = Total Debt (\$39.4 B) - Total Cash (\$0.939 B) = \$38.461 Billion
Total Equity Value = \$39.50 B + \$113.90 B - \$38.461 B
**Total Equity Value = \$114.94 Billion**

### **4. Fair Value Calculation and Conclusion**

**Fair Value per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value per Share = \$114,940,000,000 / 248,341,900
**Fair Value per Share = \$462.83**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **\$462.83** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$461.56** |
| **Valuation Gap** | **\$1.27 (0.27% above market)** |

#### **Justification and Market Assumption**

The calculated fair value of **\$462.83** is remarkably close to the current market price of **\$461.56**.

**This suggests that the market's assumptions are closely aligned with the conservative and management-guided model developed here:**

*   **Market's Revenue/Growth Assumption:** The market is likely pricing HCA for a long-term revenue growth rate of approximately **5.0%** (similar to the one used in this model) following the strong 2025 management guidance.
*   **Market's Margin/Profitability Assumption:** The market assumes HCA can sustainably maintain or slightly improve its current strong Net Income Margin, stabilizing around **8.5% to 8.7%**.
*   **Market's Discount Rate (Cost of Capital):** The close valuation suggests the market's implied Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) or Discount Rate is also near **8.0%**, factoring in the company's substantial but well-managed debt load and stable, non-cyclical cash flows. The company's debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is in the low end of their stated range, which supports a lower cost of capital.
*   **Market's Terminal Value Assumption:** The market is projecting a conservative, yet consistent, maturity rate of long-term cash flow growth (approx. **2.5%**).

The minimal discrepancy shows that HCA's valuation is largely driven by its core business fundamentals, and the management's transparent, conservative long-term guidance is being accepted and priced in by investors. The market is not overly optimistic or pessimistic about the long-term prospects relative to the conservative business engine analysis.
