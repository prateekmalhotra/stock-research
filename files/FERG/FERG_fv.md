### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

**Business Engine Justification:**
Ferguson is the largest value-added distributor in the North American construction market, serving plumbing, HVAC, appliances, and waterworks. Its revenue is primarily generated from two segments: **Residential** (approx. 54% of sales) and **Non-Residential** (approx. 46%), which are further split into **Repair, Maintenance, and Improvement (RMI)** (approx. 60%) and **New Construction** (approx. 40%).

The business engine is driven by:
1.  **Market-leading RMI exposure:** RMI is less cyclical and more stable than new construction, providing a resilient revenue base.
2.  **Organic Growth:** Gaining market share by leveraging its scale and service-based model. FY2025 saw 3.2% organic growth.
3.  **Bolt-on Acquisitions:** Consolidating the fragmented market, which added 1.0% to FY2025 revenue.
4.  **Pricing/Inflation:** While the market was challenging with some deflation in the past, management noted a return to "mild inflation" in the latest quarter (Q4 2025).

**Revenue Projections:**
Management is "confident in our markets over the medium term, leveraging multiyear tailwinds" in both residential and non-residential markets. They guided for **mid-single-digit revenue growth** for Calendar Year 2025.

| Year | Basis Period | Revenue (Billion USD) | Year-over-Year Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Base)** | Aug 2024 - Jul 2025 | \$30.80 | 3.8% (Actual) | FY2025 reported Net Sales. |
| **FY2026** | Aug 2025 - Jul 2026 | \$32.03 | **4.0%** | Conservative estimate at the low end of management's "mid-single-digit" growth guidance, reflecting organic growth, acquisitions, and a stabilization of pricing/inflation. |
| **FY2027** | Aug 2026 - Jul 2027 | \$33.31 | **4.0%** | Continued 4.0% growth, assuming multi-year tailwinds in the construction market as per management commentary. |
| **FY2028** | Aug 2027 - Jul 2028 | \$34.64 | **4.0%** | Maintained 4.0% growth. |
| **FY2029** | Aug 2028 - Jul 2029 | \$35.78 | **3.3%** | Conservative step-down to reflect a slowdown in the business cycle and a normalization of growth as the market matures. |
| **FY2030** | Aug 2029 - Jul 2030 | \$36.94 | **3.3%** | Maintained 3.3% growth. |

### III. Margin and ROIC Projections

**Net Income Margin Justification:**
*   FY2025 GAAP Net Income Margin: \$1.828B / \$30.8B $\approx$ 5.93%.
*   Management guided for an Adjusted Operating Margin of 9.2% to 9.6% for Calendar Year 2025.
*   **Assumption:** A conservative and stable **6.0% Net Income Margin** is projected. This is slightly above the last reported GAAP figure, reflecting better, stable operations in line with management's cost discipline and margin guidance.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Justification:**
The average 3-year historical ROIC is 17.02%, and the Trailing Twelve-Month (TTM) ROIC is around 15.25%-15.91%.

*   **Assumption:** A conservative, stable **15.0% ROIC** is used.

**Net Income (Cash Flow Proxy) Calculation:**
The rule is: *Net Income for next year = (Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions) + (ROIC from net income got from previous year)*. The Net Income from the previous year is considered cash available for reinvestment.

| Year | Revenue (A) (Millions) | Net Income Margin (B) | Net Income from Operations (A*B) (C) | Previous Year's Net Income (D) | ROIC (E) | Additional Income (D*E) (F) | Total Net Income (C+F) (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | \$30,800 | 5.93% | \$1,828 | - | - | - | \$1,828 (Base) |
| **FY2026** | \$32,030 | 6.0% | \$1,922 | \$1,828 | 15.0% | \$274 | **\$2,196** |
| **FY2027** | \$33,311 | 6.0% | \$1,999 | \$2,196 | 15.0% | \$329 | **\$2,328** |
| **FY2028** | \$34,643 | 6.0% | \$2,079 | \$2,328 | 15.0% | \$349 | **\$2,428** |
| **FY2029** | \$35,787 | 6.0% | \$2,147 | \$2,428 | 15.0% | \$364 | **\$2,511** |
| **FY2030** | \$36,971 | 6.0% | \$2,218 | \$2,511 | 15.0% | \$377 | **\$2,595** |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Discount Rate and Maturity Rate Justification:**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **9.0%** - This is a conservative WACC, close to the TTM WACC of 9.67% and appropriate for a large, established industrial distributor with a strong balance sheet (Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 1.1x).
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate, g):** **2.5%** - A very conservative rate for perpetual growth, slightly above long-term inflation targets and below the final projection growth rate (3.3%), reflecting the mature nature of the construction distribution industry.

**1. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of Forecast Period (2026-2030):**

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (Millions) | Discount Factor (1/(1+0.09)^t) | Net Present Value (NPV) (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** (t=1) | \$2,196 | 0.9174 | \$2,015 |
| **2027** (t=2) | \$2,328 | 0.8417 | \$1,959 |
| **2028** (t=3) | \$2,428 | 0.7722 | \$1,875 |
| **2029** (t=4) | \$2,511 | 0.7084 | \$1,779 |
| **2030** (t=5) | \$2,595 | 0.6499 | \$1,687 |
| **NPV of Forecast Period** | | | **\$9,315** |

**2. Calculate Terminal Value (TV):**
The terminal value assumes a constant growth rate (Maturity Rate) in perpetuity after the forecast period.

*   Next Year's Cash Flow (Year 2031) = Year 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + g)
    *   Year 2031 Cash Flow = \$2,595 million * (1 + 0.025) = \$2,660 million

*   Terminal Value at Year 2030 (TV) = Next Year's Cash Flow / (Discount Rate - g)
    *   TV = \$2,660 / (0.090 - 0.025) = \$40,923 million

**3. Calculate Terminal Value NPV:**
*   Terminal Value NPV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^t
    *   Terminal Value NPV = \$40,923 million / (1 + 0.090)^5 = \$40,923 * 0.6499 = **\$26,595 million**

**4. Total Equity Value (Intrinsic Value):**
*   Total Enterprise Value = NPV of Forecast Period + Terminal Value NPV
    *   Total Enterprise Value = \$9,315 million + \$26,595 million = **\$35,910 million**

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | \$35,910 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$4,200 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | +\$674 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$32,384 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 196.151 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | \$32,384 million / 196.151 million shares = **\$165.00** |

---

### VI. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **\$165.00** |
| **Current Market Price (FERG)** | **\$247.19** |

**Justification of Discrepancy:**

The calculated **Fair Value of \$165.00** is significantly lower than the **Current Market Price of \$247.19**. This indicates that the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about Ferguson's future growth and/or profitability than the conservative model presented here.

**Market's Implied Assumptions vs. Conservative Model:**

1.  **Higher Growth Rate:** The market is likely pricing in a higher revenue growth rate than the assumed **4.0% - 3.3%** in the model. Given FERG's market share gains and "multiyear tailwinds," the market may be assuming:
    *   **Higher Long-Term Growth (Perpetual Growth Rate):** My model uses 2.5%. A market value of $247.19 would require a Perpetual Growth Rate closer to **4.5% - 5.0%** to justify the terminal value, implying strong, sustainable growth well above GDP and inflation for a mature distributor.
    *   **Higher Medium-Term Growth:** The market likely expects growth to remain in the upper end of the "mid-single-digit" (e.g., 5.5% - 6.0%) for the entire forecast period, driven by aggressive bolt-on M&A and structural tailwinds in HVAC and Waterworks.

2.  **Higher Profitability/ROIC:** The market may assume a more effective conversion of revenue into profit. My model uses a conservative **6.0% Net Income Margin** and **15.0% ROIC**. The market may be assuming:
    *   **Higher Operating Margins:** Taking the high end of the management's *Adjusted* Operating Margin guidance (9.6%) and assuming less tax/interest drag, leading to a Net Income Margin closer to **7.0% - 7.5%**.
    *   **Higher ROIC:** A sustained ROIC closer to its 3-year historical average of **17.02%** or higher, meaning more efficient compounding of retained earnings.

**Conclusion:**

The conservative DCF model, which is based on a Discount Rate of 9.0%, a modest Revenue Growth of 4.0% stepping down to 3.3%, and a stable 6.0% Net Income Margin, suggests a Fair Value of **\$165.00**. The current market price of \$247.19 reflects a belief that Ferguson can sustain a significantly higher growth rate and/or higher margins over the long term, with a perpetual growth rate near or exceeding 5.0%. The market is likely giving substantial credit to the company's superior ROIC and its ability to consolidate the fragmented market, which my model conservatively downplays in its final growth and margin assumptions. **The current stock price appears overvalued based on conservative, justified growth and margin projections.**
