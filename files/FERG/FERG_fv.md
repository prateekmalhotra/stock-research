## 2. Business Engine & Projection Assumptions

Ferguson is the largest value-added distributor in the North American construction market, primarily serving water and air specialized professionals. The business engine for revenue growth is driven by three main levers:
1.  **Organic Growth:** Gaining market share in a highly fragmented market and capitalizing on multiyear tailwinds in residential and non-residential markets.
2.  **Acquisitions:** Executing a strategy of continued market consolidation through bolt-on acquisitions (e.g., nine acquisitions in FY2025 adding $\sim$\$300 million in annualized revenue).
3.  **Price Management:** Disciplined pricing to manage commodity price deflation and inflation.

### Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

*   **Base Revenue (FY2025):** We use the reported full-year sales of **$30,800 million** for fiscal year 2025.
*   **Conservative Growth Rate:** To be conservative, we assume the company's annual revenue growth will moderate from its recent strong pace. The 4.0% YoY growth assumption below is a blend of:
    *   Modest market recovery/growth (construction is cyclical).
    *   Conservative organic market outperformance.
    *   Continued, but slowing, contribution from bolt-on acquisitions.

| Year | Revenue Base (USD M) | YoY Growth Assumption | Projected Revenue (USD M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Actual Base)** | $30,800 | - | $30,800 |
| **2026** | $30,800 | 4.0% | $32,032 |
| **2027** | $32,032 | 4.0% | $33,313 |
| **2028** | $33,313 | 3.5% | $34,479 |
| **2029** | $34,479 | 3.5% | $35,688 |
| **2030** | $35,688 | 3.0% | $36,759 |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth)** | $36,759 | 2.0% | - |

**Justification:** The growth rate is intentionally lowered over time (4.0% to 3.0%) to reflect the conservative nature of the valuation and the cyclicality of the construction market, settling at a very conservative **2.0%** perpetual growth rate (Maturity Rate) in 2030, well below long-term GDP growth potential.

### Margin and ROIC Projections

*   **Net Income Margin:**
    *   Historical (FY2023-FY2025) Net Income Margin average is approximately 6.08% ($1,889M/$29,700M, $1,735M/$29,600M, $1,856M/$30,800M).
    *   **Assumption:** We use a conservative and flat **6.0%** Net Income Margin for all projected years (2026-2030), reflecting the consistency and stability of the distribution business model, balanced by the ongoing pressure from operating cost inflation.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
    *   The 3-year average ROIC has been approximately 16.79%.
    *   **Assumption:** We use a very conservative **12.0%** ROIC to calculate the additional income generated by retaining the previous year's net income. This is significantly below the company's historical performance, adhering to the "conservative but reasonable" rule.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for the projected years is treated as Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the purpose of this valuation, as per the instruction. The formula for the projected net income for a year $N$ is:

$$\text{Net Income}_N = (\text{Projected Revenue}_N \times 6.0\%) + (\text{Net Income}_{N-1} \times 12.0\%)$$

### A. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow)

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B = A * 6.0%) | Accumulated Cash (C = Previous Year's NI) | ROIC Income (D = C * 12.0%) | Total Cash Flow (B + D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $30,800 | 6.0% | $1,848 | $0 | $0 | $1,848 |
| **2026** | $32,032 | 6.0% | $1,922 | $1,848 | $222 | $2,144 |
| **2027** | $33,313 | 6.0% | $1,999 | $4,070 | $488 | $2,487 |
| **2028** | $34,479 | 6.0% | $2,069 | $6,557 | $787 | $2,856 |
| **2029** | $35,688 | 6.0% | $2,141 | $9,413 | $1,129 | $3,270 |
| **2030** | $36,759 | 6.0% | $2,206 | $12,683 | $1,522 | $3,728 |
| **Accumulated Cash for ROIC:** Sum of prior year's Total Cash Flow. *For 2027:* $1,848 (2025) + $2,144 (2026) = $4,070.

### B. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** We use a conservative discount rate of **9.0%**. This is a reasonable WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) proxy for a large, stable, investment-grade distributor exposed to cyclical construction.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** We use a very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%**. This is below the average long-term growth of the North American economy.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the 2030 Cash Flow, assuming a 2.0% perpetual growth rate.
$$\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
$$\text{TV} = \frac{\$3,728 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$3,803}{0.07} = \$54,329$$

### C. Net Present Value (NPV)

The Discount Factor is $1 / (1 + 9.0\%)^\text{Years}$.

| Year | Total Cash Flow (E) | Discount Factor | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026 | $2,144 | $1 / (1.09)^1 = 0.9174$ | $1,967 |
| 2027 | $2,487 | $1 / (1.09)^2 = 0.8417$ | $2,093 |
| 2028 | $2,856 | $1 / (1.09)^3 = 0.7722$ | $2,206 |
| 2029 | $3,270 | $1 / (1.09)^4 = 0.7084$ | $2,315 |
| 2030 | $3,728 | $1 / (1.09)^5 = 0.6499$ | $2,423 |
| **Terminal Value** | $54,329 | $1 / (1.09)^5 = 0.6499$ | $35,309 |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows (Intrinsic Enterprise Value)** | | | **$46,313** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated by taking the Intrinsic Enterprise Value (NPV) and adjusting for the current balance sheet items.

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$46,313 + \$555 - \$4,124 = \$42,744 \text{ million}$$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Future Cash Flows (Intrinsic Enterprise Value) | $46,313M |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $555M |
| Subtract: Total Debt | $4,124M |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$42,744M** |
| Shares Outstanding (in millions) | 195.55M |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$218.59** |

## 5. Fair Value Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$218.59** |
| **Assumed Current Market Price** | **$240.00** |

### Justification

The calculated fair value of **$218.59** per share is approximately **8.9% lower** than the assumed current market price of $240.00. The market's valuation implies an intrinsic value that is about 9% higher than this conservative model.

The market is likely making one or more of the following assumptions that are more optimistic than those used in this conservative DCF:

1.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate:** The market is factoring in a higher long-term growth rate (Maturity Rate) than the conservative 2.0% used here. If the construction market remains robust and FERG's market share gains continue, a long-term growth rate of **2.5%** or **3.0%** would be plausible. A 2.5% maturity rate (with all other assumptions remaining constant) would result in a fair value per share of **$242.44**, closely aligning with the current market price. The market may assume FERG can sustain a long-term growth rate closer to its historical average or an optimistic view of the infrastructure/non-residential market tailwinds.
2.  **Higher Reinvestment Return (ROIC):** The market might be assuming the company can generate returns closer to its historical 3-year average ROIC of $\sim$16.8%, rather than the conservative 12.0% used in this model.
3.  **Higher Operating Leverage (Margin Expansion):** The market may be projecting a gradual increase in the Net Income Margin (e.g., from 6.0% to 6.5% by 2030) based on management's focus on cost control and operating leverage, which would significantly increase the projected cash flows.
4.  **Lower Discount Rate:** Given FERG's strong balance sheet (Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 1.1x) and its market dominance, the market may be applying a lower discount rate (WACC) to its cash flows, perhaps 8.0% or 8.5%, indicating a lower perception of risk.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF model suggests that the stock is currently slightly overvalued ($\sim$9% overvaluation). However, the small difference is primarily explained by the market projecting a more optimistic, yet still reasonable, long-term growth rate (Maturity Rate) of approximately 2.5% to 2.6%, which reflects the continued success of FERG's strategy of market outperformance and value-added distribution in a consolidating North American construction market.
