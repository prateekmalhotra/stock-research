## Business Summary

Nelnet, Inc. primarily operates in the United States, focusing on financial services and technology related to education. Its foundational and most reliable business centers on holding and servicing older student loans that are guaranteed by the US government. This portfolio generates predictable cash flow, which the company uses to fund its growing, diversified segments. These segments include providing software and payment processing technology to K-12 schools and colleges (B2B customers) and building and operating high-speed fiber optic internet infrastructure (Allo Communications), mainly serving residential and business customers in the Midwest. Therefore, the core model is based on extracting stable, government-backed cash flow from a shrinking asset base to invest in higher-growth technology and communication ventures.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk involves political and regulatory changes within the student loan sector, which is subject to intense federal oversight. Since the company’s servicing revenue depends heavily on US Department of Education contracts, regulatory actions, such as mass student loan forgiveness or prolonged payment pauses, can immediately reduce cash flow and profitability. This type of intervention occurred during the recent federal payment pause, highlighting the vulnerability of the servicing segment. The primary long-term risk is the slow but unavoidable decline of its most profitable unit—the stable, legacy portfolio of government-guaranteed student loans. Because the company cannot originate new loans for this program, Nelnet must successfully execute its capital-intensive diversification strategy (fiber internet and EdTech) before the reliable earnings from the loan portfolio shrink too much. If the competitive pressure in the fiber optic market increases, or if the new ventures fail to achieve sufficient scale, overall earnings and market position could be negatively impacted.

## Company History

Nelnet, Inc. (NNI) is a financial services and technology conglomerate that grew out of the student loan industry, deliberately diversifying its business over decades to adapt to major government and regulatory changes.

Here is a detailed history of Nelnet, Inc.:

### **Inception and Early Success (1978 - 2009)**

1.  **The Founding Goal: Simplifying Student Loans**
    *   Nelnet’s history begins in Lincoln, Nebraska, around 1978 with the formation of a non-profit organization and a loan servicing company, initially called Union Financial Services, Inc..
    *   The founders, who had experience in student loan collections, saw a fragmented and inefficient system for handling student debt and aimed to create a simplified, "vertically integrated" platform that could manage all aspects of education finance, from lending to servicing.

2.  **The Name and Core Business**
    *   The company officially became the National Education Loan Network, or Nelnet, in 1996 and focused heavily on the **Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP)**.
    *   **Tailwind:** The FFELP program provided a major initial tailwind, allowing private companies like Nelnet to originate federally guaranteed student loans, giving them a stable, long-term asset with low risk.
    *   The company grew quickly, merging with and acquiring other education finance organizations and becoming publicly traded in 2003.

### **Major Headwinds and Innovative Solutions (2010 - Present)**

3.  **Headwind: The End of FFELP and Regulatory Pressure**
    *   **Problem:** In 2010, the government passed a law that discontinued new loan originations under the FFELP program, meaning Nelnet’s primary, low-risk business model was set to slowly wind down as existing loans were paid off.
    *   **Solution: Strategic Diversification:** Nelnet responded by making diversification its core strategy, aiming to reduce reliance on the declining FFELP portfolio and unstable federal contracts by expanding into different lines of business.

4.  **Innovative Solution 1: Education Technology & Payments (Nelnet Business Services)**
    *   The company significantly expanded its **Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing** segment (known as Nelnet Business Services or NBS).
    *   This includes offering proprietary technology for tuition payment plans, financial aid management software, and school administration systems for K-12 schools, higher education, and other institutions.
    *   This shift provided a new, reliable source of **fee-based income** that was not directly tied to the highly regulated federal student loan market.

5.  **Headwind: Constant Federal Contract Uncertainty**
    *   **Problem:** The federal student loan servicing market remained highly competitive and subject to frequent and unpredictable changes by the Department of Education.
    *   In 2020, Nelnet and its Great Lakes subsidiary were initially excluded from new federal servicing contracts, and in 2023, they faced significant price reductions and the transfer of a million borrowers, forcing the company to announce staffing reductions.
    *   **Solution: Bouncing Back with Expertise:** Despite these setbacks, Nelnet maintained its proprietary servicing systems and continued to service its own private and legacy loans. The Department of Education later awarded Nelnet a new servicing contract, recognizing the value of its operational scale and technology.

6.  **Innovative Solution 2: New Ventures and Investments**
    *   To further diversify outside the core education industry, Nelnet launched and invested in businesses like:
        *   **Allo Communications:** A high-speed fiber internet provider, which became a significant non-education investment.
        *   **Nelnet Bank (2020):** A bank that allows the company to originate and hold a wider range of private education, consumer, and other loans.
        *   **Renewable Energy:** Investments in community solar and other projects.

7.  **Headwind: Consumer Advocacy and Litigation**
    *   **Problem:** As a major loan servicer, Nelnet faced scrutiny and legal action over allegations of failing to properly inform borrowers about key deadlines for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, which are crucial for affordable payments and loan forgiveness.
    *   **Response:** The company has settled some of these claims and is constantly required to adjust its compliance and customer communication practices to meet rigorous and evolving federal and state consumer protection laws.

### **Nelnet Today and Its Goal**

8.  **The Company Today:**
    *   Nelnet is now a diversified holding company with a focus on five main areas: **Asset Generation and Management** (the shrinking FFELP portfolio), **Loan Servicing and Systems** (federal, private, and consumer loan servicing), **Education Technology, Services, and Payment Processing**, **Nelnet Bank**, and **Communications/Renewable Energy**.
    *   The company has an explicit focus on **innovation** as a core cultural pillar, constantly exploring new products and markets to stay ahead of regulatory and technological changes.

9.  **The Goal:**
    *   Nelnet’s ultimate goal is to **enrich lives through financial and educational services** by becoming a leading provider across a diversified range of businesses, ensuring long-term value not by relying on a single, aging revenue stream, but by serving as an efficient, technology-driven partner in the education and financial sectors.
    *   The strategy is to use the cash flow from its legacy loan business and federal servicing contracts to fund the growth of its new, high-growth, fee-based businesses like EdTech, payments, and other ventures.

## Moat Analysis

Nelnet, Inc.’s (NNI) business moat is built on a unique combination of deeply entrenched government contracts in its legacy business and high switching-cost software in its growing technology and payments division. This diversification is the primary reason for its sustained growth.

***

### 1. Moat Type and Differentiation: A Tale of Two Moats

*   **Differentiated Moat:** Nelnet’s primary defense is not a single moat but two distinct competitive advantages in its core segments: **Regulatory Barrier/Scale** (in Loan Servicing) and **High Switching Costs** (in Education Technology/Payments).
*   **Competitor Difference:** While competitors in loan servicing (like MOHELA or Aidvantage) share the same regulatory barrier, Nelnet differentiates itself with its **Education Technology Services and Payment Processing (ETSP)** segment, where its FACTS software is a clear market leader in K-12 tuition management. This profitable, diversified software business is an advantage most loan servicing competitors lack.

### 2. Market Position, Pricing Power, and Differentiation

*   **Federal Loan Servicing (LSS):** Nelnet is one of a few private companies contracted by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) to service federal student loans. This position is an **Intangible Asset/Regulatory Barrier**, as the government limits competition to a handful of large, qualified entities.
    *   **Pricing Power is Limited:** In this segment, Nelnet’s revenue is fee-based and dictated by the DOE contract, meaning it has little independent pricing power with the government. Its competitive edge comes from operational efficiency and a proven track record to continually win these large, long-term government contracts.
*   **Education Technology (ETSP - FACTS):** This segment holds a strong special position as the largest provider of actively managed tuition payment and school management systems for private K-12 schools.
    *   **Pricing Power is Implied:** In the ETSP segment, Nelnet charges a fee to schools and families, and its market dominance and the critical nature of the software allow for stronger implied pricing power, as schools are highly dependent on their integrated system for all financial operations.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Ease of Displacement

*   **Customer/Contract Stickiness (LSS - Loan Servicing):** The contracts are **long-term and recurring** with the U.S. government, providing a stable revenue base that lasts for the life of the loan portfolio. When private lenders sell their loan portfolios, they often choose Nelnet because of its **massive scale and proven track record** in transferring and managing hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, creating a high switching cost for the *client institution*.
*   **Customer Stickiness (ETSP - FACTS):** The contracts with schools are highly **sticky and recurring**. FACTS software integrates core administrative functions like tuition management, financial aid assessment, and enrollment systems. Once a school's entire financial and administrative back-office runs on the system, the cost, time, and risk of migrating to a competitor (the **switching cost**) are extremely high, making it difficult for a rival to displace.
*   **Displacement by Capital:** Nelnet is **not easily displaced by capital alone** because a new entrant would need more than just money; they would require decades of specialized regulatory expertise, the immense infrastructure to manage over half a trillion dollars in assets, and the hard-won federal contracts. To challenge the ETSP segment, a competitor would need to build a comparable, deeply integrated solution and convince thousands of schools to undertake a complex and disruptive switch.

### 4. Moat Building Strategy and Innovation (R&D)

*   **The Reason for Growth (Diversification and Acquisition):** Nelnet’s long-term growth and survival stems from its ability to use its core competence (managing massive, complex educational finance portfolios) and **strategically diversify**. Key moves include:
    *   **Acquisition/Scale:** Acquiring Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc., which cemented its position as one of the largest federal loan servicers, giving it efficient scale.
    *   **Diversification:** Building and acquiring the ETSP business (FACTS was acquired in 2006) to shift revenue towards higher-margin, sticky, fee-based software to offset the run-off nature of its legacy loan portfolio.
*   **Network Effects:** While not a classic social media network effect, Nelnet benefits from **Efficient Scale**. The sheer volume of loans and payments it processes allows it to negotiate better rates, invest more in security and compliance (both critical in finance and education), and accumulate proprietary data and operational expertise that smaller players cannot match.
*   **Investment in R&D/Innovation:** Nelnet consistently invests in its **technology infrastructure and data analytics** across all segments. The nature of its ETSP business, which relies on a best-in-class, integrated software platform for thousands of institutions, requires continuous and significant investment to maintain an edge in functionality, security, and user experience. It must constantly innovate its service delivery to keep up with regulatory changes and customer demands, especially in the competitive software-as-a-service (SaaS) education space.

## Catalyst Analysis

Nelnet, Inc. (NNI) is a diversified company with major segments in student loan servicing, education technology, asset management, and banking. Its catalysts are tied to the performance of these core businesses and strategic investments.

## Catalysts for Nelnet, Inc. (NNI)

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Growth in Loan Servicing and Private Loan Portfolio:**
    *   The company is experiencing a significant increase in revenue in its Loan Servicing and Systems segment due to the conversion of new, large private education loan portfolios (like those from Discover and SoFi) during late 2024 and early 2025.
    *   Management's strategy explicitly highlights investing in **loan servicing** and the shift to the new federal servicing contract (Unified Servicing and Data Solution or USDS) as a key area of focus for future performance.

2.  **Increased Profitability in Education Technology:**
    *   The Education Technology Services and Payments segment had a "record-breaking year" in 2024, and continued strong results or expansion in this fee-based revenue business could provide consistent, high-margin growth.
    *   Recent acquisitions, such as Next Gen Web Solutions in early 2025, and new product launches like 'Notify' and 'Propelr,' are expected to expand the company's footprint in higher education and workforce learning, potentially boosting revenue.

3.  **Winding Down of Solar Project Losses:**
    *   The company reported losses in its non-core solar construction business throughout 2024 due to negative margins on certain legacy projects.
    *   Management noted they were working to complete the remaining legacy construction contracts, suggesting that once these are finished, the drag on overall corporate earnings from this segment should significantly decrease or be eliminated.

4.  **Strength in Nelnet Bank and Asset Management:**
    *   Nelnet Bank's loan and investment portfolio increased, contributing to an increase in net interest margin and net interest income year-over-year.
    *   Management views Nelnet Bank and Asset Generation and Management as a focus for **consumer lending** and diversifying assets to offset earnings from the legacy student loan portfolio.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Strategic Investment Value and Capital Allocation:**
    *   The company realized a significant gain from the partial redemption of its investment in ALLO Holdings (a fiber optic communications company) in Q2 2025, demonstrating the potential for its diversified investments to create substantial shareholder value.
    *   Nelnet continues to hold a 27% ownership interest in ALLO, indicating potential for further valuation increases or future capital returns from this major investment.

2.  **Success of Diversification Strategy:**
    *   Management's strategy is to continue diversification both within and outside its education-related businesses, focusing on technology and payments in education as core areas.
    *   The long-term performance of new ventures and acquisitions in education technology will be key to creating new, sustained growth engines as the legacy student loan portfolio naturally declines over time.

3.  **Dividend Policy and Shareholder Returns:**
    *   Nelnet recently announced an increase in its quarterly dividend.
    *   Consistent dividend increases and prudent capital allocation signal confidence in future cash flows and serve as a long-term incentive for investors.

---

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Nelnet, Inc.'s (NNI) management incentives and compensation structure, the evidence strongly suggests that management and directors have a high incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **High Managerial Ownership:** The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Jeff Noordhoek, directly holds a significant personal stake in the company, owning approximately 1.5% of the shares, which is valued in the tens of millions of dollars. This high degree of "skin in the game" creates a powerful, direct alignment between the CEO's personal wealth and the company's long-term stock performance.
2.  **Managerial Tenure:** The executive management team and the board of directors are highly seasoned, with average tenures of around 11.7 and 11.3 years, respectively. This tenure suggests a focus on long-term stewardship and strategic stability rather than short-term gains.

### **Compensation Structure and Level**

3.  **Below-Industry Compensation:** The CEO’s total compensation for 2024 was approximately \$1.6 million, which is reported to be substantially below the median total compensation for CEOs in comparable companies in the American Consumer Finance industry. This indicates that the executives are not incentivized to simply "line their own pockets" through excessive pay.
4.  **Incentive-Based Pay Component:** Executive compensation includes a significant portion of variable, incentive-based pay, with the CEO’s 2024 compensation being comprised of approximately 56% salary and 44% in performance-tied compensation, including stock and options.
5.  **Performance Metrics (Plan):** The Executive Officers Incentive Compensation Plan is designed to align officers’ interests with those of shareholders by providing opportunities to earn performance-based compensation. The plan allows for a wide range of metrics such as Total Shareholder Return (TSR), Earnings Per Share (EPS), Net Income, and Return on Equity (ROE).

### **Conclusion on Shareholder Incentive**

*   **Strong Alignment:** The high percentage of personal stock ownership by the CEO, combined with a total compensation package that is modest compared to industry peers, is a compelling indicator that management is primarily incentivized to drive long-term shareholder value.
*   **Balance of Incentives:** While the compensation structure allocates a relatively higher percentage to salary than some industry peers, the presence of a formal incentive plan tied to a mix of financial and strategic performance metrics, and the massive personal equity stake, suggests a strong emphasis on sustained company growth and acting in the shareholders' best interest.

## Price History

Based on the stock price data for Nelnet, Inc. (NNI) as of September 26, 2025, here is an analysis of its recent price history and technical standing.

### Nelnet, Inc. (NNI) Stock Analysis

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The closing stock price for Nelnet, Inc. (NNI) was \$126.14. The stock's 52-week trading range is between a low of \$98.15 and a high of \$136.17.

2.  **Distance from 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **28.52%** above its 52-week low of \$98.15. This indicates a strong upward price movement over the past year.

3.  **Recent Price Movement (Up Bigly):** The stock has been on a strong upward trend, having recently set new all-time highs, which culminated in the 52-week high of \$136.17. The price increase of over 28% from the 52-week low classifies the recent performance as a significant gain.

4.  **Explanation for Large Gains:** The substantial stock increase in the last few months is primarily linked to strong financial performance. Nelnet reported that its **Q2 Earnings Per Share (EPS) jumped by 320%** and it also had a strong Q4 in the prior year, with both revenue and EPS exceeding market expectations. Additionally, news of a partial redemption of a technology investment was announced, which was expected to result in a \$30 million pre-tax gain.

5.  **Technical Analysis – Is it Trading Low?** The technical analysis signals are mixed, suggesting it is **not currently trading low** but rather in a rising trend:
    *   **Moving Averages:** The overall rating from moving averages is a "strong buy," indicating an established upward momentum.
    *   **Oscillators:** Analysis from oscillators, which gauge if an asset is oversold or overbought, returned an overall "neutral" rating.
    *   **Mixed Signals:** While some models hold a negative evaluation for the short-term, a buy signal from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was noted, suggesting positive intermediate-term momentum.
    *   **Overall:** The stock has a high technical rating from some financial data providers. Since it is closer to its 52-week high than its low and has a "strong buy" from moving averages, it is generally considered to be in an uptrend rather than trading at a low based on technical analysis.

---

## Long Thesis

Nelnet’s bull case centers on its successful, ongoing transformation from an old-school student loan holder into a diversified financial technology and communications company. In the near term, the company benefits from two things: the highly predictable, low-risk cash flow generated by its shrinking legacy portfolio of government-guaranteed student loans, and significant new contracts to service large private loan portfolios. This stable income is being funneled into its high-growth segments, specifically its education software and payments division (EdTech), which earns reliable fees from schools (a high-margin business with sticky customers). In the long term, this diversification strategy will pay off. As the old loan portfolio slowly disappears, the profitable EdTech segment and its valuable fiber internet investment (Allo Communications) will mature and generate enough recurring, technology-driven revenue to fully replace and exceed the legacy earnings, delivering sustained growth and rewarding shareholders through savvy capital allocation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. Regulatory stability is maintained, meaning the profitable legacy student loan portfolio is allowed to wind down naturally without sudden intervention (like mass forgiveness) that would immediately eliminate the company’s core cash engine. 2. Management successfully executes its capital allocation strategy, meaning the cash flow from the aging loan portfolio is efficiently invested in and scales the higher-growth ventures (EdTech and Allo Fiber). 3. The EdTech and Payments segment maintains its market leadership, and its high-margin, fee-based revenue continues to grow rapidly, successfully offsetting the inevitable decline of the legacy interest income. 4. The new, large private loan servicing contracts (like those from Discover/SoFi) are transitioned smoothly and contribute significantly to overall revenue, proving the scalability and value of Nelnet’s servicing platform.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Nelnet, Inc. presents a compelling narrative of successful corporate transformation, but it relies on several optimistic and potentially flawed assumptions. The primary holes and faults relate to the certainty of its cash engine, the capital demands of its growth segments, and the competitive environment.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Flaw in the Core Cash Engine's "Predictability" and "Stability":**
    *   The assumption of **"Regulatory stability"** is high-risk, as the highly profitable legacy FFELP loan portfolio remains vulnerable to sudden political/regulatory intervention, such as a major student loan forgiveness program or changes to interest rate spreads, which could immediately eliminate the core cash engine.
    *   The company's servicing division continues to face **regulatory scrutiny** and legal action, as demonstrated by a 2024 settlement with a state attorney general over alleged failures to properly communicate with borrowers about income-driven repayment plans, which can lead to fines and increased compliance costs.

2.  **Flaw in the Long-Term Vision for Allo Communications (Fiber Internet):**
    *   The thesis describes Allo as a valuable asset that "will mature and generate enough recurring, technology-driven revenue to fully replace and exceed the legacy earnings." However, Nelnet recently **partially exited** this investment, receiving a significant cash redemption and reducing its ownership from 45% to 27% in Q2 2025.
    *   This move re-characterizes the long-term benefit of Allo from a high-growth, wholly-owned operating segment that would *replace* legacy earnings to a highly successful **financial investment** that provided a substantial one-time gain and a reduced, minority-stake source of equity income.
    *   Fiber network build-out is **extremely capital-intensive**, which creates a significant and ongoing demand for the cash flow generated by the legacy loan portfolio, potentially crowding out other strategic investments and acting as a major cash drag until the network build-out slows and the business matures.

3.  **Vulnerability of the "Savvy Capital Allocation" Strategy:**
    *   The assumption that cash flow is "efficiently invested" is challenged by results in other diversified segments, such as the company’s **solar construction business, which reported a loss** in the fourth quarter of 2024.
    *   The strategy exposes the company to **macroeconomic risks** beyond the stable FFELP portfolio, as rising interest rates have been cited by management as increasing the cost of capital for both Allo and solar development projects.

4.  **Competitive Risk to EdTech/Payments "Market Leadership":**
    *   While the EdTech and Payments segment is currently high-growth and contributes the majority of net income, the **"sticky" and "market leadership"** assumption may be threatened by well-funded private equity-backed or publicly traded EdTech competitors that could undercut pricing or offer more robust, integrated software solutions, pressuring the segment's high margins.
    *   The EdTech space is rapidly evolving, and a failure to maintain the pace of technological innovation against aggressive rivals could quickly erode Nelnet's competitive advantage in this key growth area.

### Bear Case Thesis for Nelnet, Inc. (NNI)

1.  **Accelerated Erosion of Core Earnings:** The highly stable, predictable cash flow from the legacy FFELP loan portfolio, which underpins the entire diversification strategy, is at continuous and increasing risk of a sudden, political, or regulatory-driven event (e.g., mass loan forgiveness) that would liquidate the asset and eliminate the funding for all future growth ventures.
2.  **The High Cost and Diminished Return of Diversification:** The new growth segments, particularly Allo Communications and the solar business, are either highly capital-intensive or carry significant execution risk, demanding a substantial and continuous portion of the legacy cash flow for years before achieving true scale or profitability, making "savvy capital allocation" a much riskier proposition than the bull case suggests.
3.  **Lack of a Clear Successor to FFELP Net Income:** The partial monetization of Allo, while profitable, means that its future earnings contribution will be a reduced equity interest rather than a fully-consolidated operating income stream, leaving the EdTech segment as the *sole* remaining high-growth division expected to *fully* replace the massive net interest income of the declining legacy portfolio.
4.  **Regulatory and Execution Headwinds:** The dual pressures of ongoing regulatory scrutiny and fines in the student loan servicing business, combined with the execution risk and losses in other newer, unrelated ventures like solar construction, demonstrate that the company’s transformation is exposed to operational setbacks and is not as smoothly executed as the bull case assumes.

## Next Steps

The existing analysis provides a great narrative but lacks the specific financial data required for a deep-dive valuation and risk assessment. The recent Q1/Q2 2025 results found in the search clarify several key points, but also raise new, quantifiable questions.

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate:

### **1. Financial Modeling of the Core Cash Engine (FFELP)**

*   **Quantify the Decline Rate:** Determine the projected annual run-off rate for the Asset Generation and Management (AGM) segment's legacy FFELP loan portfolio. The average balance decreased from **\$11.6 billion** in Q1 2024 to **\$9.5 billion** in Q1 2025, or about **18%** year-over-year, which is faster than the "slow wind down" narrative suggests, and is critical for cash flow modeling.
*   **Net Interest Margin Stability:** Investigate the trend and forecast for the *loan spread* (net interest margin) in the AGM segment. The increase in net interest income has been recently driven by a wider spread, which offsets the run-off; future stability of this spread is key to the bull case.

### **2. Deep Dive into the Allo Communications (ALLO) Investment**

*   **Future Capital Demands and Exit Strategy:** With Nelnet's ownership reduced to **27%** and receiving **\$411 million** in Q2 2025, the investment is now an associate/non-controlling interest with a carrying value of **\$0**. Determine the **specific annual capital commitment** Nelnet is still required or expected to make to Allo for fiber build-out, as the capital-intensive risk is still present.
*   **Expected Valuation/Monetization:** Search for management commentary or analyst estimates regarding the **total implied valuation** of ALLO Communications and Nelnet’s stated **long-term plan** for the remaining 27% stake (i.e., is the plan to hold, or is a full exit expected in the next few years?).

### **3. Assessment of Growth Engine Profitability (EdTech/Payments)**

*   **Segment Profitability:** Calculate the gross margin and operating margin for the Education Technology Services and Payments (ETSP) segment, using the provided data (Revenue less direct costs to provide services: **\$69.7 million** on Revenue of **\$108.3 million** in Q4 2024). This will help confirm the high-margin nature of the business and support the long-term thesis.
*   **Competitive Moat Validation:** Research the market share and pricing power of the FACTS K-12 tuition management system against its primary competitors (e.g., Blackbaud, PowerSchool, or private equity-backed rivals). The bear case's concern over competitive pressure needs to be quantified.

### **4. Status and Scale of Nelnet Bank (NNI Bank)**

*   **Current Scale and Growth:** Analyze the growth of Nelnet Bank's loan and investment portfolio, which was **\$872.2 million** in Q1 2025. Determine its **current percentage contribution** to the total Net Interest Income (NII) to see if it is growing fast enough to meaningfully replace the declining FFELP NII.
*   **Credit Quality and Loan Loss Provision:** Investigate the recent trend in the **provision for loan losses** at Nelnet Bank, which increased in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, as this suggests a rising credit risk as the bank scales its consumer lending.

### **5. Management Incentives and Non-Core Risk**
