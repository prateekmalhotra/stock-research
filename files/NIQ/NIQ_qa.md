## Business Summary

NIQ operates primarily as a business-to-business provider of consumer intelligence, acting as the global scorekeeper for the retail industry. Its core business model is collecting massive amounts of data on what products are sold, where they are sold (both in physical stores and online), and at what price, primarily by partnering with major retailers around the world who share their sales data. This raw data is then cleaned, analyzed, and packaged into recurring, expensive subscription reports and software tools. The primary customers are global manufacturers of consumer packaged goods (CPG), like companies making food, drinks, and household supplies, who use these insights to optimize pricing, promotions, and inventory, ensuring they sell more than their competitors. While operating globally, a significant portion of NIQ's revenue comes from established markets in North America and Europe.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for NIQ is the loss of access to critical data sources. If major retailers decide to stop sharing sales data, or if they build proprietary advertising and data platforms for CPG companies (a trend that has accelerated recently, threatening NIQ's position as the neutral third party), NIQ's product value diminishes. Historically, market measurement providers have always faced intense competition and the need for expensive technological updates; however, the current shift toward rapid e-commerce and digital advertising requires NIQ to continuously invest heavily to accurately measure the 'digital shelf.' A long-term risk involves data privacy regulation: stricter global laws regarding how consumer data is collected and used could make consumer panels less effective or increase compliance costs, undermining the detailed insights NIQ sells and potentially reducing its earnings and market share.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the origin and journey of **NIQ** (formerly NielsenIQ and A.C. Nielsen Company), a global company that specializes in understanding what consumers buy.

### **Part 1: Inception and Core Mission**

1.  **Original Founding and Founder:** The company was founded in 1923 in Chicago, Illinois, by an engineer named Arthur C. Nielsen Sr., and was originally called the A.C. Nielsen Company.
2.  **Initial Goal (The Beginning):** Arthur C. Nielsen Sr. initially started the business to test the performance and efficiency of industrial manufacturing machines.
3.  **The Pivot (Why it was founded):** The business quickly shifted its focus to addressing a major problem for manufacturers and retailers: they lacked reliable and objective information about what was actually selling and why. During the Great Depression in 1933, the company officially became a **"consumer intelligence provider,"** meaning its sole job was to collect and interpret data on consumer sales.
4.  **The Enduring Goal:** The company's core mission became to give marketers trustworthy data on how well their products and promotions were performing, essentially pioneering the concept of **"market share"**—what percentage of total sales a company captures.

---

### **Part 2: Evolution and Innovative Solutions**

1.  **Early Innovation (Paper and Pen to Data):** In the 1930s, the first solution was manually collecting sales volume and product variety data from retail stores like drug stores and food stores, allowing companies to understand what products were making it onto the shelves and how quickly they were selling.
2.  **Technological Leap (The 1980s):** A major step forward in measurement came in 1988 with the introduction of new technology, which allowed consumers, known as "panelists," to use **handheld scanners** at home to record all their purchases and transmit that data—this system became known as the Homescan program. This greatly improved the accuracy and speed of tracking consumer purchasing patterns.
3.  **Go Global:** International expansion began early, with the first location outside the U.S. opening in the United Kingdom in 1939, establishing a key tailwind of global reach that expanded to over 76 countries by 1994 and over 100 countries today.
4.  **The Digital Overhaul (2017):** To keep up with the digital world, the company introduced the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry's first truly open, cloud-based, and highly scalable technology platform, making data analysis faster and easier for clients.

---

### **Part 3: Headwinds, Tailwinds, and Present Day**

1.  **Headwind: The Rise of E-commerce (The Omnichannel Problem):** The biggest modern challenge was the shift from physical stores to online shopping. The company needed to combine data from both **brick-and-mortar** (physical stores) and **e-commerce** (online) to give companies a complete, or "omnichannel," view of the consumer.
2.  **Solution: Strategic Acquisitions:** To deal with this, in 2021, the company made several key acquisitions to boost its e-commerce measurement and gain access to online purchase data. This helped it transition from just measuring what sold in stores to measuring the **"Full View"** of all consumer buying behavior.
3.  **Headwind: Data Privacy and Security:** As data collection grew, so did the need for secure, privacy-compliant data handling.
4.  **Solution: Data Clean Rooms and AI:** The company launched a global **"data clean room"** on platforms like Snowflake, which is a secure digital space that allows marketers to combine their own customer data with NIQ’s consumer data without revealing any personal information, ensuring privacy is protected. They also adopted **Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence)** tools, like "Ask Arthur," to let clients quickly explore data and get insights.
5.  **A Major Tailwind (Private Equity Acquisition and Rebrand):** In 2021, the consumer intelligence portion of the business was sold by Nielsen Holdings to the private equity firm Advent International, and the name changed to NielsenIQ (eventually shortened to **NIQ**). This move gave the company a dedicated focus and significant investment to accelerate its technology and global expansion.
6.  **The Present (The GfK Combination):** In 2023, NIQ combined with another industry leader, GfK, which specialized in technology and durable goods (like electronics). This combination created a single, powerful company capable of delivering the world's most complete view of what consumers buy across not only everyday grocery items but also all other types of goods, cementing its status as a global leader in consumer intelligence.

## Moat Analysis

NIQ (NielsenIQ) has built a robust and durable moat, primarily based on its immense scale of proprietary data, its role as a mandatory "system of record" for the industry, and high customer switching costs.

***

### **1. The Foundational Data Moat and Scale**

*   **Proprietary Data Scale:** NIQ covers an unparalleled amount of consumer spending, measuring approximately **\$7.2 trillion** in global consumer spending across **90+ countries** and processing over **3.1 trillion data records per week** from over **21 million stores**. This enormous, proprietary data set is nearly impossible for a new entrant to replicate, even with significant capital.
*   **The "Full View" Differentiation:** Unlike competitors who may specialize in one area, NIQ offers a "Full View" of consumer buying behavior by merging traditional in-store retail measurement (FMCG data) with real-time e-commerce and "Tech & Durables" data (significantly expanded through the 2023 acquisition of GfK). This holistic, omnichannel view is a major differentiator, giving clients a single, "unified source of truth" to see how their products perform everywhere.
*   **High Barrier to Displacement:** It would be extremely difficult and capital-intensive for a new company to displace NIQ because they would need to establish data collection agreements with millions of retailers globally, a process that has taken NIQ nearly a century (since its founding in 1923) to build.

***

### **2. Network Effects and Industry Standard**

*   **Network Effect of a "Common Language":** NIQ’s data serves as the **"gold standard"** for the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) and retail industry. Manufacturers and retailers use this common data set to benchmark their performance against competitors, to plan production, and, critically, for brands to pitch new products or strategies to retailers.
*   **The Self-Reinforcing Flywheel:** As more retailers share their data with NIQ, the overall data set becomes more comprehensive and accurate. This increased quality attracts more manufacturers to use the platform, which further solidifies its position as the required, common benchmark. This is a powerful **Data Network Effect** that makes the service increasingly valuable as more participants use it.
*   **Embedded Business Process:** Because NIQ’s reports are the basis for critical business decisions—from product development to sales strategy—they are deeply embedded in the client's day-to-day operations, creating high friction, or **switching costs**, if a client decided to move to a new provider.

***

### **3. Pricing Power and Customer Dynamics**

*   **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The business is not based on one-time transactions. The company explicitly relies on **Subscription Revenue** from **annual and multi-year contracts**.
*   **Pricing Power and Customer Expansion:** The stickiness is evidenced by its high **Net Dollar Retention (NDR)**, which has been consistently over 103%. An NDR above 100% means that existing customers, on average, are not only renewing their contracts but are also spending *more* money each year by purchasing additional services or expanding their subscription, demonstrating NIQ's strong pricing power and the essential value of their data.
*   **Essential for High-Value Decisions:** NIQ's products are not just data feeds; they are sophisticated analytical tools that help clients make critical, high-dollar decisions like optimizing pricing, trade promotions, and product innovation. This makes their service a necessity, not a luxury, allowing them to maintain a strong pricing position.

***

### **4. Innovation and The Reason for Growth**

*   **Historical Foundation:** The original reason for its growth was being the first to effectively measure retail sales, becoming the trusted source for a paper-based retail world.
*   **Modern Innovation for Edge:** The company is now adapting to the digital age by making significant investments in innovation and R&D.
    *   **Acquisition-Driven Growth:** Strategic acquisitions (like GfK for durables and e-commerce data) are used to continuously expand its "Full View" and global footprint.
    *   **AI Integration:** NIQ is actively integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its products, such as **"Ask Arthur,"** a generative AI tool designed to help clients navigate and utilize their massive data sets faster and more easily. This constant innovation is necessary to maintain an edge as the market shifts from purely physical stores to omnichannel retail.
    *   **Venture Investment:** The company uses its venture arm (Nielsen Ventures/Nielsen Innovate) to invest in early-stage startups focused on big data and machine learning, ensuring they stay close to new and disruptive technologies.

1.  **Financial De-Leveraging and Free Cash Flow Generation**
    *   The company expects significant free cash flow generation in the second half of 2025 and a targeted net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x by the end of 2025. Management stated the recent Initial Public Offering (IPO) and debt refinancing have already improved the capital structure and reduced the interest expense run-rate by \$100 million.

2.  **Synergies from GfK Integration**
    *   The 2023 merger with GfK is a key catalyst for profitability, with management noting a "proven integration playbook" to increase shareholder value. They explicitly expect the integration to be a major driver of margin expansion for the current and next fiscal year, with a full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin target of around 21%.

3.  **Growth in Core Subscription Revenue**
    *   The company is focused on increasing its recurring revenue base, with Intelligence subscription revenue (a version of Annual Recurring Revenue) growing by $6.9\%$ in Q2 2025, which represents the seventh consecutive quarter of high retention rates. Management is driving this growth through value-based pricing, cross-selling, and upselling of new services.

### **Long-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Next-Generation Technology and AI-Powered Products**
    *   NIQ's strategy is centered on leveraging AI and technology to deliver differentiated, granular insights for clients.

## Management Record

The analysis of NIQ's management focuses on Executive Chairman and CEO, James "Jim" Peck, and his team, who took over when the business was divested from Nielsen Holdings.

### NIQ Management Analysis for Investors

**1. Current Management and Background**
*   **CEO:** James "Jim" Peck is the Executive Chairman and CEO, having acquired the business (then Nielsen Global Connect) in partnership with private equity firm Advent International in March 2021.
*   **Track Record (Pre-NIQ):** Peck has a strong history of leading successful data and analytics company transformations, most notably as CEO of TransUnion, where he led the company's transformation, IPO, and grew its enterprise value from approximately \$3 billion in 2012 to over \$16 billion in 2019.
*   **Key Executives:** Many other NIQ executives, like Chief Technology Officer Mohit Kapoor and former Chief Legal Officer John Blenke, also followed Peck from TransUnion, indicating a cohesive, experienced team with a proven model for business transformation.

**2. Management Change and Company Turnaround**
*   **Previous Management Context:** The company, prior to the Advent/Peck acquisition, was part of Nielsen Holdings and described by Peck as having gone through a "tumultuous period" and declining to an "underperforming runner up" due to former priorities.
*   **The Transition:** The division was spun off from Nielsen Holdings and sold to Advent International in 2021, marking a change in ownership and leadership aimed at a profound transformation into a market leader.
*   **Delivery on Turnaround:** Since the spin-off, management's efforts have focused on fixing poor financial performance, redoing the entire technology stack using AI, and expanding coverage to include all consumer shopping channels, which clients are now reportedly recognizing.

**3. Key Decisions and Track Record at NIQ**
*   **Major Acquisition:** A key strategic decision was the acquisition of German market research firm GfK in 2023, which helps NIQ offer a "Total Store Read" by combining its strength in fast-moving consumer goods with GfK's expertise in technology and durables.
*   **Technology & Innovation:** Management has prioritized a major technology re-platforming and the strategic launch of AI-driven solutions, including a GenAI-based conversational tool called "NIQ Ask Arthur."
*   **Strategic Growth:** The team completed multiple strategic transactions, including acquisitions in 2021 to drive value in e-commerce and omnichannel measurement, and launched a new media division to offer a complete solution for marketing decisions.

*   **Value Proposition:** Future strategy centers on developing powerful, actionable growth roadmaps for clients through a new Strategic Analytics & Insights organization, leveraging their extensive datasets, and applying new technologies like generative AI to simplify and accelerate decision-making.

**5. Shareholder Value Creation & Public Market Context**
*   **Value Creation Model:** Peck's success at TransUnion demonstrates a clear pattern of creating value for private equity backers (Advent also backed TransUnion) and leading a company to a successful IPO.
*   **Investor Relevance:** While NIQ is currently private, the strategy of technological transformation, market consolidation (GfK), expanding coverage, and improving financial performance is a classic blueprint for preparing an asset for a successful public market listing in the future.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings, particularly the IPO Prospectus for NIQ Global Intelligence plc (NIQ), the management incentive and compensation structure provides a strong conclusion that their interests are aligned with shareholders.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for NIQ Global Intelligence plc (NIQ)

1.  **Insider Ownership (High Alignment through CEO and Sponsor):** The company is majority-owned by its private equity sponsor, Advent International, L.P. (holding 55.11% of the ordinary shares), which acts as a strong institutional alignment to maximize shareholder value.
2.  **CEO's Substantial Personal Stake:** The Executive Chairman and CEO, James M. Peck, holds a significant individual ownership stake of approximately **3.29%** (9.7 million shares), representing a highly valuable personal investment. This high individual ownership is a strong indicator that the CEO's wealth is directly dependent on the company's long-term stock performance, aligning him with public shareholders.
3.  **Recent Insider Buying:** Key executives, including the Chief Technology Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, purchased shares immediately following the company’s July 2025 IPO. [cite: 2, 7 (from previous step)] This activity signals management confidence in the company's future value.
4.  **Performance-Based Annual Cash Compensation:** The Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) for executives, such as the CFO, links a significant portion of cash compensation to company financial performance and individual goals, with a maximum payout up to 200% of the target amount. [cite: 6 (from previous step)]
5.  **Equity-Focused Long-Term Compensation:** Following the IPO, the company adopted the 2025 Equity Incentive Plan, which allows for grants of share options, performance awards, and restricted shares. [cite: 3 (from previous step)] This structure ensures that a major component of executive compensation is non-cash and directly tied to the future appreciation of the stock price, reinforcing a long-term perspective.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive

The management of NIQ is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders.

*   **Alignment Conclusion:** The *combined* incentives of a majority private equity owner (Advent International) whose primary goal is a profitable exit, and the CEO's **very high personal equity stake**, create a powerful motivation for long-term value creation.
*   **Mitigation of Self-Enrichment:** The compensation structure, now anchored by the new 2025 Equity Incentive Plan and the existing performance-based cash bonuses, places a significant portion of the executives' wealth **at risk**, dependent on both short-term financial targets and long-term stock appreciation. This effectively discourages actions solely aimed at lining their own pockets through excessive fixed compensation.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of NIQ Global Intelligence plc (NYSE: NIQ) price history and technical indicators, here is a summary.

### NIQ Stock Price History and Technical Analysis

1.  **Current Price is Near 52-Week Low:** The current closing price of approximately **\$14.11** is extremely close to its 52-week low of **\$14.03**. This means the stock is currently only **0.57%** above its 52-week low, which was set very recently (October 10, 2025).

2.  **Trading Low Based on Technicals:** Technical analysis indicators generally suggest the stock is trading in a weakened state. Moving Averages (MA5 through MA200) indicate a **"Strong Sell"** signal. However, the 14-day **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is at approximately 23.0, which suggests the stock is currently **"Oversold,"** potentially signaling that the selling pressure is overextended and a bounce could be imminent.

3.  **Significant Drop in Recent Months:** The stock has experienced a sharp decline over the last few months, dropping nearly **19%** in the last month and over **30%** year-to-date. This slide has brought it down significantly from its 52-week high of **\$20.39**.

4.  **Reason for the Big Drop:** The downward pressure began shortly after its U.S. IPO debut in July 2025. The stock priced at \$21 but opened below that at \$20.25, reflecting initial cautious investor sentiment. The continued decline is generally attributed to:
    *   **Market Sentiment:** A broader "shifting sentiment" regarding technology demand and economic growth in the data analytics sector.
    *   **Company Fundamentals:** Concerns over the company's financial profile, which includes high debt levels and a noted slowdown in topline growth, were highlighted around the time of the IPO.

5.  **Analyst Outlook Contrasts Technicals:** Despite the weak technical picture and being near its 52-week low, the stock has a strong fundamental outlook from analysts. The consensus rating is a **"Strong Buy,"** with an average 12-month price target of **\$23.00**, which is substantially higher than the current trading price and suggests analysts expect a significant recovery.

## Long Thesis

NIQ is the essential, global 'scorekeeper' for the retail industry, providing manufacturers (like Pepsi or Tide) with critical data on everything consumers buy, both in physical stores and online. The bull case rests on the company having successfully completed a major business turnaround and transformation. NIQ has cemented its massive competitive advantage (moat) by merging its massive consumer packaged goods data with GfK's durable goods data, creating a single, unparalleled 'Full View' of consumer spending that competitors cannot replicate. Under new management, the company is rapidly implementing advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and secure data clean rooms, which increases the value and stickiness of its subscription-based services. This operational efficiency, coupled with aggressive cost savings from the GfK merger, guarantees continuous, high-margin revenue growth, allowing NIQ to quickly pay down its current debt and realize significant shareholder value.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core data partnerships with major retailers must remain intact, preventing retailers from cutting off access to data and undermining NIQ's 'Full View.' Management must successfully integrate the GfK acquisition, delivering the promised cost savings and boosting profit margins (Adjusted EBITDA margin target of 21%). The significant investment into new technologies (AI and Clean Rooms) must translate directly into existing customers spending more money on upgraded services (upselling) and attracting new clients. Finally, NIQ must follow through on its promise to generate significant free cash flow and reduce its debt load to address current investor concerns.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for NIQ presents a plausible growth story based on a successful turnaround and a transformative acquisition. However, the bull case relies heavily on the full and flawless execution of complex integration and technology initiatives while understating significant, structural competitive threats and financial risks.

Here is a critique and bear case thesis, highlighting the major holes and faults:

### **Critique: Holes and Faults in the Long Thesis**

1.  **The "Unparalleled Moat" and "Full View" is an Overstatement:** The competitive advantage is directly challenged by Circana (formerly IRI), which holds its own set of exclusive retail data deals, creating a duopoly that ensures neither company has a truly "unparalleled" or complete 'Full View' of the market. Manufacturers often must pay for and integrate data from multiple vendors (NIQ, Circana, SPINS) to overcome coverage gaps, which reduces NIQ's pricing power and increases customer friction.
2.  **Structural Threat from Retail Media Networks (RMNs) Undermines Data Partnerships:** The core assumption that retailer data partnerships will remain intact is at high risk due to the explosive growth of Retail Media Networks (RMNs). Major retailers (e.g., Amazon, Walmart) are aggressively monetizing their own first-party data for advertising, which directly disintermediates third-party data providers like NIQ. This shift creates a clear incentive for retailers to hoard the most granular, real-time data, thus undermining NIQ’s entire data-syndication model.
3.  **Digital-First Competitors are Faster in High-Growth E-commerce:** While NIQ's combined data may be the "boardroom gold standard" for aggregated brick-and-mortar sales, its legacy enterprise models and slower data refresh cycles are a friction point. A new wave of digital-native competitors (e.g., Profitero, SmartScout) offer daily or intra-day real-time data on digital shelf visibility, price, and search rank, a speed advantage essential for fast-moving e-commerce brands that NIQ struggles to match.
4.  **Integration Risk is High, and Synergies are Not Guaranteed:** The thesis heavily relies on the successful, rapid integration of GfK to deliver nearly \$500 million in promised cost savings and achieve the 21% Adjusted EBITDA margin target. Large-scale mergers and technology integrations, especially cross-company platform harmonization, carry a significant risk of internal disruption, talent loss, and delays, potentially preventing the full realization of the projected high-margin revenue growth.
5.  **Technology Investment (AI/Clean Rooms) Lacks Proven Revenue Upsell:** The investment in AI and data clean rooms is an important defensive move to stay relevant, but external, verifiable evidence that this technology has directly translated into customers spending *more* (upselling) is missing. The announced clean room launches are competitive infrastructure plays, not quantifiable proof that the investment is generating continuous, high-margin revenue growth at a rate that justifies the associated capital expenditures.
6.  **Debt Load and Cash Flow Risk is Understated:** The company's focus on a "quick" debt paydown is contradicted by the significant debt load and the negative free cash flow reported in the first half of the recent fiscal year ($\sim\$279.5$ million loss). While debt refinancing has reduced interest expense, the total debt burden remains substantial, and the ability to generate the projected $\sim\$245$ million to $\$275$ million in second-half free cash flow is a crucial, high-stakes assumption required to service and reduce the current net leverage ratio.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for NIQ**

NIQ's structural competitive moat is decaying faster than management can execute its turnaround. The growth of **Retail Media Networks (RMNs)** and the rise of agile, **digital-native data competitors** are eroding the essential data access and market-share lead that underpin the long thesis. The "Full View" is increasingly fragmented as powerful retailers are incentivized to monetize their valuable first-party data directly, starving third-party providers of their most critical asset.

The high-stakes financial plan hinges on the flawless execution of a complex and costly GfK integration and a rapid technological pivot (AI, Clean Rooms) to drive immediate, sticky revenue growth. Failure to hit the aggressive **cost synergy targets and 21% margin expansion goal** will compound the burden of a substantial debt load and weaken the company's already volatile free cash flow generation, leading to a significant valuation correction. The stock is a value trap, where legacy strength in brick-and-mortar is overshadowed by a permanent, structural lag in the faster-growing e-commerce and retail media channels.

---

## Next Steps

This is a very thorough analysis. The core conflict between the "successful turnaround" long thesis and the "structural decay" bear thesis is well-defined.

The next steps should focus on quantifying the risks highlighted in the bear case and finding recent, objective data on the progress of the company's key catalysts.

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate:

### **Key Areas to Investigate**

1.  **Quantify the Competitive Response to Retail Media Networks (RMNs):**
    *   The bear case highlights RMNs as an existential threat, while the long case mentions a defensive play with the **Snowflake Data Clean Room**.
    *   **Question:** Search for any third-party assessment or updated client commentary on the adoption rate and *effectiveness* of NIQ’s digital solutions (e.g., the Snowflake clean room) in competing with, or integrating into, major Retail Media Networks like Walmart Connect or Amazon Advertising. The search results show the *launch* of the clean room, but not the *quantifiable business impact* yet.

2.  **Verify GfK Integration & Synergy Progress:**
    *   The long thesis hinges on realizing approximately **$500 million in synergies** to reach a **21% Adjusted EBITDA margin** target.
    *   **Question:** Search for the **latest official financial updates** from NIQ to see if they have reaffirmed, raised, or lowered their synergy and margin targets *after* the Q2 2025 earnings call. This is the most crucial execution risk to verify.

3.  **Evaluate Current Valuation vs. Competitors (The Stock's Discount):**
    *   The stock is trading near its 52-week low with a "Strong Buy" analyst consensus, suggesting a major disconnect.
    *   The Enterprise Value (EV) is between $\$$8.68 billion and $\$$10.066 billion, with a Last Twelve Months (LTM) **EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 12.19x to 15.0x** (depending on the source/data date).
    *   **Next Step:** Find the current or forward-looking EV/EBITDA multiples for its closest, most relevant pure-play competitor, **Circana**, and any other comparable data analytics/syndicated data companies (e.g., SPGI, Verisk, *if* applicable) to definitively show if NIQ is *actually* undervalued relative to its peers.

4.  **Deep Dive into Competition (Circana and Digital Rivals):**
    *   The analysis notes a duopoly with Circana and a threat from agile digital players.
    *   **Question:** Search for independent, recent (2025) reports that compare the coverage and data speed of NIQ's "Full View" (NIQ + GfK) directly against **Circana's Liquid Data** platform, especially in the crucial and faster-growing **e-commerce** and **durables** segments. The search results confirmed that NIQ and Circana are the two main players.

5.  **Long-Term Debt and Financial Leverage Outlook:**
    *   The bear case highlights the debt load and negative Free Cash Flow (FCF) in H1 2025.
    *   **Question:** What is the most current (post-IPO) **Net Leverage Ratio**? Management's target is 3.5x by year-end 2025; finding the current ratio will allow for a calculation of how much EBITDA and/or FCF they need to generate in H2 to hit that goal, which quantifies the risk of failure.
