### **2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions**

The business is divided into two main segments: **HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering)** and **Workwear**. Growth is primarily driven by contract wins, price increases, and improved operational efficiency.

#### **A. Revenue Projection (2025-2030)**

The engine is driven by a combination of organic growth (new contract installations, price recovery) and small, targeted acquisitions. Management is confident about continued progress.

| Year | Revenue Rationale & Assumptions | Projected Revenue ($\text{£M}$) | YoY Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | Base Year | $\text{513.4}$ | $\text{10.3%}$ |
| **2025** | Management guided H1 2025 revenue increase of $\text{5.5%}$ over H1 2024. We use this conservative rate for the full year, despite Q1 being $\text{6.1%}$. | $\text{541.6}$ | $\text{5.5%}$ |
| **2026** | Organic growth continues from contract wins and full-year effect of 2025 price hikes, but at a moderating, conservative pace due to "unpredictable" consumer spend in HORECA. | $\text{563.3}$ | $\text{4.0%}$ |
| **2027** | Conservative moderation as market normalizes. | $\text{583.0}$ | $\text{3.5%}$ |
| **2028** | Further moderation. | $\text{600.5}$ | $\text{3.0%}$ |
| **2029** | Approaching long-term UK GDP/inflation-linked growth. | $\text{615.5}$ | $\text{2.5%}$ |
| **2030** | Conservative maturity rate proxy. | $\text{627.8}$ | $\text{2.0%}$ |

#### **B. Margin Projection (2025-2030)**

Management has a key target: an **Adjusted Operating Margin of at least $\text{14.0%}$ by 2026** (2024: $\text{12.1%}$). This is supported by fixed energy prices for the next two years and continued focus on operational efficiency to manage high labor costs.

To remain conservative, the Net Income Margin is modeled below the adjusted operating margin to account for non-operating costs (finance, tax).

*   **Tax Rate:** UK Corporation Tax rate of $\text{25\%}$ is applied.
*   **Conservative Net Income Margin:**
    *   2024 Statutory Net Income Margin: $\text{6.93%}$
    *   2025: $\text{8.5%}$ (Conservative step-up towards the $\text{14.0%}$ operating margin target).
    *   2026-2030: $\text{9.0%}$ (This is well below the implied potential from a $\text{14.0%}$ Operating Margin, assuming high, steady finance costs, thereby making the projection conservative).

#### **C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

*   **Historical ROIC:** The Return on Investment for 2024 was $\text{8.09\%}$ [cite: 6 (from previous search)].
*   **Assumption:** A conservative ROIC of **$\text{8.0\%}$** is used.

### **3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The Net Income for each year is calculated as:
**Net Income*($\text{t}$) = (Revenue($\text{t}$) * Net Income Margin($\text{t}$)) + (Net Income($\text{t-1}$) * ROIC)**

| Year | Revenue ($\text{£M}$) | Net Income Margin | NI (Base) ($\text{£M}$) | ROIC Adj. (NI * $\text{8.0%}$) ($\text{£M}$) | Total Net Income ($\text{£M}$) | Discount Factor ($\text{10.0%}$) | Net Present Value (NPV) ($\text{£M}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $\text{513.4}$ | $\text{6.93%}$ | $\text{35.6}$ | N/A | $\text{35.6}$ | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | $\text{541.6}$ | $\text{8.5%}$ | $\text{46.04}$ | $\text{35.6} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{2.85}$ | $\text{48.89}$ | $\text{0.9091}$ | $\text{44.45}$ |
| **2026** | $\text{563.3}$ | $\text{9.0%}$ | $\text{50.70}$ | $\text{48.89} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{3.91}$ | $\text{54.61}$ | $\text{0.8264}$ | $\text{45.14}$ |
| **2027** | $\text{583.0}$ | $\text{9.0%}$ | $\text{52.47}$ | $\text{54.61} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{4.37}$ | $\text{56.84}$ | $\text{0.7513}$ | $\text{42.70}$ |
| **2028** | $\text{600.5}$ | $\text{9.0%}$ | $\text{54.05}$ | $\text{56.84} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{4.55}$ | $\text{58.60}$ | $\text{0.6830}$ | $\text{40.06}$ |
| **2029** | $\text{615.5}$ | $\text{9.0%}$ | $\text{55.40}$ | $\text{58.60} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{4.69}$ | $\text{60.09}$ | $\text{0.6209}$ | $\text{37.31}$ |
| **2030** | $\text{627.8}$ | $\text{9.0%}$ | $\text{56.50}$ | $\text{60.09} \times \text{8.0%} = \text{4.81}$ | $\text{61.31}$ | $\text{0.5645}$ | $\text{34.60}$ |
| **Total NPV of Explicit Period Cash Flows** | | | | | | | **$\text{244.26}$** |

#### **Terminal Value Calculation**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate ($g$):** $\text{2.0%}$ (Assumes long-term growth is in line with or slightly below inflation/UK GDP).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate ($r$):** $\text{10.0%}$ (A reasonable, conservative rate reflecting the company's size, stability, and market risk).
*   **Terminal Cash Flow (2030):** $\text{61.31M}$

$\text{Terminal Value} = \text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + g) / (r - g)$

$\text{Terminal Value} = \text{61.31} \times (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = \text{61.31} \times \text{1.02} / \text{0.08} = \text{784.70M}$

$\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value} / (1 + r)^6$

$\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{784.70M} / (1 + 0.10)^6 = \text{784.70M} \times \text{0.5645} = \text{443.08M}$

### **4. Fair Value Calculation**

**Total Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows**

$\text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV of Explicit Period} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
$\text{Total NPV} = \text{£244.26M} + \text{£443.08M} = \text{£687.34M}$

**Fair Value of Equity**

$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$
$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{£687.34M} + \text{£11.5M} - \text{£127.1M} = \text{£571.74M}$

**Fair Value Per Share**

$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \text{Fair Value of Equity} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$
$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \text{£571.74M} / \text{392.28M shares} = \text{£1.4574}$

### **5. Conclusion and Justification**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$\text{£1.4574}$** ($\text{145.74p}$) |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **$\text{£1.3540}$** ($\text{135.40p}$) |
| **Valuation Difference** | **$\text{+7.64%}$** (Undervalued) |

#### **Justification for Valuation and Market Assumptions**

The calculated Fair Value of **$\text{145.74p}$** is $\text{7.64%}$ higher than the current market price of $\text{135.40p}$. This suggests the stock is modestly undervalued based on a conservative DCF model built on management's own targets.

**The market's current assumptions (Implied Discount Rate):**

The market is trading the stock at a price that essentially validates the company's management targets, but with a slightly less aggressive view of its long-term growth or a higher risk profile.

If we assume the market agrees with the other conservative inputs (Cash, Debt, Revenue, and Margin growth for the explicit period), the market's implied assumption is a slightly higher risk/discount rate or a lower terminal growth rate.

*   **Market Implied Risk:** The market may be discounting the shares by a slightly higher rate (e.g., $\text{10.5%}$ or $\text{11.0%}$) than the $\text{10.0%}$ used in this model, reflecting genuine macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in the consumer-sensitive HORECA division (as noted by management).
*   **Skepticism on Margin Achievement:** While management has a clear path to the $\text{14.0%}$ adjusted operating margin by 2026, the market may be pricing in a failure to fully achieve this, perhaps due to persistent high labor costs or unexpected energy price spikes after the current fixed-price contracts expire.
*   **Conservative Net Income Margin:** The model's use of a very conservative $\text{9.0%}$ Net Income Margin (post-tax and finance costs) on a $\text{14.0%}$ Operating Margin already bakes in considerable conservatism. If the market expects greater efficiency in finance costs, the undervaluation gap could be even wider.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The calculated Fair Value is close to the current market price, suggesting the market is largely aligned with the company's stated medium-term growth and margin targets. The small undervaluation indicates that the market is applying a slightly more pessimistic or higher-risk discount to the long-term cash flows than the $\text{10.0%}$ used in this conservative analysis. **Johnson Service Group PLC (JSG.L) stock is conservatively valued at $\text{£1.4574}$ per share.**
