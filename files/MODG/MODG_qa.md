## Business Summary

Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. operates using a dual business model that combines selling physical golf products with providing entertainment services. The equipment division sells traditional golf clubs, balls, and gear globally to serious golfers. The apparel division sells lifestyle clothing (like TravisMathew) worldwide to affluent consumers. The core service business is Topgolf, which operates large, high-tech driving ranges that appeal to a wide demographic, including families, young adults, and non-traditional golfers, primarily across the United States. Customers at Topgolf pay for entertainment by the hour and also purchase high-margin food and drinks. This strategy aims to capture recurring revenue from entertainment services while maintaining a steady flow of sales from golf equipment and casual apparel.

## Business Model Risk

The company faces significant near-term risks tied to consumer spending, as both new golf equipment and out-of-home entertainment (Topgolf visits) are considered non-essential purchases. If the economy weakens, customers are likely to cut back on buying expensive new clubs or going out for entertainment, directly harming earnings. For the long term, a major risk is the saturation of the Topgolf market; if the company builds too many venues in popular areas, it could dilute the customer base and reduce revenue per location. Historically, the traditional golf industry has always been cyclical, meaning sales decline severely during recessions, and the company is also vulnerable to unpredictable weather, which prevents people from playing golf or visiting outdoor venues. Finally, the manufacturing side of the business faces continuous cost threats from inflation in raw materials and logistics, potentially reducing profit margins on every club and ball sold.

## Company History

This history lesson will cover the company's journey, which began as a premium golf equipment maker, Callaway Golf, and evolved into the modern, diversified company, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG).

### The History of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG)

#### The Foundation: Callaway Golf Company (1982-2020)

1.  **The Beginning and Founding Purpose (1982):** The company was founded by Ely Reeves Callaway Jr., a successful textile and wine executive who was also an avid golfer. He bought a 50% stake in a small, struggling club manufacturer called Hickory Stick USA, renaming it to focus on creating premium golf equipment.
2.  **The Guiding Philosophy:** Callaway's founder believed in creating products that were "pleasingly different and demonstrably superior," with the core mission to develop more forgiving, high-tech clubs to help recreational golfers improve their game.
3.  **The First Innovative Solution (The Big Bertha):** In 1991, Callaway launched the iconic Big Bertha driver, a revolutionary club featuring a much larger, stainless steel clubhead. This oversized design made the driver significantly more forgiving and easier to hit than traditional clubs, launching the company into the top tier of the golf industry.
4.  **Early Headwinds and Strategic Response:** After its founder stepped away in the late 1990s, the company's performance briefly suffered as management's focus shifted away from its core golf club business. The solution was a rapid restructuring and a renewed commitment to innovation and outspending rivals on research and development (R&D) to regain its leadership position.
5.  **Dealing with Industry Challenges:** In the early 2000s, Callaway faced industry headwinds like a softening economy, slower industry growth, and new rules from golf's governing bodies that limited how much clubs could improve. To counter this, Callaway continued its aggressive innovation, using new materials like titanium and carbon composites, and began strategically acquiring other brands.
6.  **Diversification for Stability:** Over the years, Callaway expanded its portfolio beyond clubs and balls by acquiring key complementary brands like Odyssey putters, OGIO bags, and TravisMathew apparel. This strategy provided new revenue streams and reduced the business’s reliance solely on golf equipment sales, adding an "active lifestyle" segment.

#### The Evolution: The Topgolf Merger (2021-Present)

7.  **The Transformative Acquisition (2021):** The biggest change came in 2021 when Callaway Golf Company acquired Topgolf Entertainment Group, an interactive golf entertainment chain, in a deal valued at about $2 billion. Callaway already had a minority stake in Topgolf since 2006.
8.  **The Rationale for the Merger (A Major Tailwind):** The merger was a strategic move to tap into a massive tailwind: the rising interest in "modern golf" and non-traditional ways of playing. Callaway wanted to widen its customer base, connecting its premium equipment with Topgolf's fun, tech-enabled venue experience that attracts casual players and non-golfers.
9.  **The New Name and Goal (2022):** The merged company rebranded as **Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp.** (MODG) in August 2022 to reflect its new identity as a diversified leader in "tech-enabled modern golf." The overall goal is to be a part of every shot played around the world and empower more people to enjoy the game in all its forms, both on and off the course.
10. **Modern Innovation and Technology:** Today, a core innovative solution is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to design golf club faces, like in the Paradym Ai Smoke series. This cutting-edge technology analyzes thousands of different swing types to create club faces with multiple "sweet spots" for better performance across the whole face.
11. **Recent Headwinds and a Strategic Pivot:** Despite the vision, the integration of the businesses faced headwinds, including a significant financial impairment loss related to the Topgolf segment in 2024. This financial challenge and market conditions led the company to announce a major strategic pivot.
12. **The Current Plan (Separation):** As a result of these challenges, the company announced a plan in late 2024 to separate the two businesses by late 2025. The original Callaway Golf Company (focused on equipment and apparel) will separate from Topgolf (the venue-based entertainment business) to allow each to focus on its own strategy and growth. This move aims to simplify the structure and unlock value for shareholders.

## Moat Analysis

Based on a review of the company's business model and competitive landscape, here is an analysis of the moat for Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG):

### **MODG's Core Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Unique Integrated Ecosystem:** The company's primary differentiation lies in its merger of two distinct businesses—Topgolf (experiential entertainment) and Callaway (premium golf equipment)—creating a single, vertically integrated golf ecosystem.
2.  **Appealing to the Full Spectrum of Golfers:** Topgolf venues act as a fun, low-pressure entry point that introduces the game to millions of non-golfers, while the Callaway brand serves committed, performance-focused players, effectively capturing the entire customer journey.
3.  **Hybrid Business Model (Topgolf):** Topgolf venues offer a unique "golf-plus-entertainment" experience that combines a high-tech, gamified driving range with a full-service food and beverage operation, making it a destination for social gatherings and corporate events.

***

### **Special Market Position and Pricing Power**

1.  **Strong Brand Equity:** Both the **Topgolf** and **Callaway** names possess significant brand recognition. Callaway is a market leader in premium golf clubs and holds the largest market share for club sales, giving it a degree of pricing power over unbranded competitors.
2.  **Pricing Power in Entertainment:** The unique, technology-driven, social atmosphere of Topgolf allows the company to charge premium prices for bay rental, as well as high-margin food, beverages, and event hosting, differentiating it from a simple driving range.
3.  **Toptracer Technology:** The proprietary Toptracer ball-tracking technology, which powers the games at Topgolf, is also licensed to traditional driving ranges globally, creating a high-margin technology revenue stream and expanding the brand's reach.

***

### **Growth Reason and Displacement Difficulty**

1.  **Reason for Growth (MODG's "How"):** The company grew into what it is today by successfully shifting the perception of golf from an exclusive, time-consuming sport to an inclusive, accessible form of entertainment, largely through the aggressive expansion of the Topgolf venue footprint.
2.  **Difficulty of Displacement (Capital Requirement):** A major capital requirement is needed to build and outfit a single, large Topgolf venue, including the real estate, construction, and high-tech equipment. This large, established physical footprint of over 100 venues creates a significant barrier to entry for new competitors.
3.  **Displacement by Capital:** A well-funded competitor could try to replicate the model (e.g., Drive Shack), but overcoming the strong, established brand recognition of Topgolf and Callaway, along with securing prime real estate in target markets, would be a major challenge.

***

### **Customer Stickiness and Recurring Moat Strategies**

1.  **Recurring and Sticky Customers (Topgolf):** Topgolf generates recurring revenue through repeat visits for casual play, food, and beverage sales, as well as sticky business-to-business contracts from private and corporate events. The company also offers membership and loyalty programs to encourage repeat business.
2.  **Recurring and Sticky Customers (Callaway):** Brand loyalty in the equipment segment is strong, as committed golfers tend to stick with a club brand once they find one that performs well, especially since the company offers a full line of products and custom club fitting.
3.  **Network Effects:** Topgolf venues benefit from a form of network effect; the more popular and well-known the location is, the more people want to go there to socialize, which further attracts more visitors and events.
4.  **Innovation and R&D Investment:** The company maintains its edge by constantly innovating, especially in its Golf Equipment segment, where it invests in R&D to leverage technology, including artificial intelligence, in new product design to maintain a leadership position.
5.  **Tour and Promotional Investment:** The Golf Equipment division must continually invest significant capital in sponsoring professional golfers, advertising, and promotional support to maintain brand visibility and compete with other well-financed equipment companies like TaylorMade and Titleist.

## Catalyst Analysis

Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) is undergoing a major strategic shift, which has created the primary stock catalysts.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Expected within 6-12 months)

1.  **Partial Sale of Topgolf and Debt Reduction:** The company has a definitive agreement to sell a 60% stake in its Topgolf and Toptracer business to Leonard Green & Partners, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. This deal is a major near-term catalyst as it brings in approximately $\$770$ million in net cash proceeds.
2.  **Focus on Core Brands and Balance Sheet Strength:** The substantial cash from the Topgolf sale will be used to significantly pay down the company's debt, which is a major concern for investors. **Management is focusing the company's resources and future growth on its profitable Golf Equipment and Active Lifestyle brands (Callaway, TravisMathew, etc.).**
3.  **Topgolf Same-Venue Sales Improvement:** Topgolf showed an inflection point in the third quarter of 2025, returning to positive same-venue sales growth. **Management has noted the positive consumer reaction to its value initiatives (like "Sunday Funday") and sees this as confirmation that they "are on the right path" to stabilizing and improving venue performance.**

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Re-rating as a Pure-Play Golf/Active Lifestyle Company:** Upon closing the Topgolf transaction, the company plans to change its name and ticker to Callaway Golf Company (CALY). This separation could lead to a "re-rating," meaning investors may assign a higher value to the newly focused company by comparing it to peers with lower debt and a clearer business model.
2.  **Continued Topgolf Venue Expansion (Growth Engine Remains):** The remaining 40% stake in Topgolf allows MODG to benefit from its continued expansion. Topgolf recently celebrated its 100th U.S. venue opening, and it remains a global growth engine that now has external funding to support its aggressive expansion plans without burdening the parent company's balance sheet.
3.  **Ongoing Performance of Callaway and Active Lifestyle Brands:** The core Golf Equipment business has remained strong and is a key area of focus for the management. **Management has highlighted continued growth and product innovation (like the new Elite driver) and the benefits from cost reduction and margin improvement initiatives as key contributors to their positive outlook.**
4.  **Operational Efficiency and Margin Improvement:** Management has consistently raised its full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance, citing better than expected results and continued cost management initiatives to offset external pressures like tariffs. Continued successful execution of these efficiency and cost-saving programs will directly improve future profitability.

---

## Management Record

The management of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) is defined by its long-tenured leadership and a recent, significant strategic shift toward simplifying the corporate structure.

### **CEO and Core Management Profile**

1.  **Oliver G. "Chip" Brewer III** has served as President and CEO since March 2012, demonstrating long-term stability and leadership.
2.  Brewer is credited with transforming the company from a traditional golf equipment manufacturer into a "Modern Golf and active lifestyle company."
3.  The core management team and the Board of Directors are notably seasoned, with average tenures of 12.6 years and 9 years, respectively, suggesting deep industry experience.
4.  Other key executives include Brian P. Lynch (EVP, CFO & Chief Legal Officer) and Glenn F. Hickey (EVP and President, Callaway Golf).

### **Track Record and Key Decisions**

5.  **Transformational Merger:** The most significant decision was the 2021 all-stock merger with Topgolf, an off-course entertainment venue, which CEO Brewer has called a "bet the company" move.
6.  **Corporate Rebranding:** The company rebranded from Callaway Golf (ELY) to Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG) in 2022 to emphasize the strategic importance of the Topgolf segment, which management projected could account for over half of company earnings.
7.  **Delivering on Promises (Mixed):** Management has generally exceeded Q3 2025 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance, leading to a raised full-year outlook. However, the Topgolf segment has faced challenges, including concerning traffic declines and a reliance on value initiatives and promotions to drive same-venue sales growth.
8.  **Portfolio Simplification:** Management executed the sale of the non-core Jack Wolfskin apparel brand to reduce complexity, strengthen the balance sheet, and refocus capital on the core golf and entertainment ecosystem.

### **Changes in Management and Strategy**

9.  **Internal Topgolf Leadership Change:** Artie Starrs, the CEO of the Topgolf segment, resigned in July 2025 to take another CEO position, a move which has since affected the timeline for the planned Topgolf separation.
10. **The Major Strategic Pivot (2025):** The company has dramatically shifted its future strategy from an anticipated tax-free spin-off of Topgolf to a **sale of a 60% majority interest in Topgolf** to private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners.
11. **Rationale for Separation:** This strategic simplification is intended to unlock shareholder value by separating the high-capital, high-growth, lower-margin venue business (Topgolf) from the stable, high-margin Golf Equipment and Active Lifestyle business (Callaway).

### **Future Strategy and Vision**

12. **Focusing on "Pure-Play" Callaway:** The post-transaction vision is for the remaining public company (Callaway) to be a pure-play golf and lifestyle company with a stronger balance sheet, a low leverage profile, and strong free cash flow, which could enable capital return to shareholders (e.g., share repurchases or a dividend).
13. **Retained Topgolf Upside:** Callaway will retain a 40% minority interest in Topgolf, providing future financial upside without having any operational role in the venue business.
14. **Topgolf's New Mandate:** Under the new private equity ownership, Topgolf is expected to slow its capital-intensive new venue openings and instead focus on driving profitability and improving operating margins from its existing large venue base.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp.'s (MODG) compensation structure and ownership data, here is an evaluation of management's incentive alignment with shareholders.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for MODG

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **High Overall Insider Ownership:** Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) reports an exceptionally high level of insider ownership, with approximately **45.32%** of the company's stock held by insiders. This figure is significantly higher than average and strongly suggests a high degree of direct financial alignment with shareholder value, as management and major insider groups are substantial owners.
2.  **Direct CEO Ownership:** The President and CEO, Oliver G. (Chip) Brewer III, directly owns a measurable stake, cited at approximately **1.07%** of the company's shares. This percentage, in combination with the larger insider group, reinforces that his personal wealth is highly dependent on the stock's performance.

#### **Compensation Structure**

3.  **Equity-Heavy Compensation:** The compensation structure for the Named Executive Officers (NEOs), including the CEO, is heavily weighted toward long-term equity awards (stock awards), indicating a focus on sustained stock price appreciation. For example, the CEO's compensation for the 2024 fiscal year was approximately **88.3%** in stock award value.
4.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus:** The majority of Long-Term Incentive (LTI) awards granted to NEOs are in the form of **Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs)** and service-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). The use of PRSUs ties the largest portion of executive pay to achieving multi-year performance conditions, while all equity value remains dependent on the stock price.
5.  **Performance Metrics for Annual Incentive:** The annual incentive plan (AIP) for executives is tied to corporate financial goals, primarily using metrics such as **Adjusted EBITDA** and specific business unit financial results. The below-target payout for the 2023 annual incentive, due to a failure to meet the Adjusted EBITDA target, demonstrates that the cash bonus is genuinely at risk and linked to operational performance.

#### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

6.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** The management of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) appears to have sufficient incentive to act in the best interest of shareholders. The extraordinarily high total insider ownership means management's and directors' financial well-being is directly tied to a rising stock price.
7.  **Focus on Shareholder Value Creation:** The compensation structure, with its heavy reliance (nearly 90% for the CEO) on long-term equity awards, specifically performance-based units, ensures that executives are incentivized to generate sustainable, long-term shareholder returns, rather than focusing on short-term gains to "line their own pockets."

## Price History

Based on the current analysis of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) stock price and recent company news, here is an analysis of its price history and technical standing. The data reflects an approximation based on recent market information (as of early December 2025 in the search results).

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) is currently trading significantly above its 52-week low. With a recent price around **\$12.21** and a 52-week low of **\$5.42**, the stock is approximately **125.3%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Trading Low Based on Technical Analysis:** The stock is **not currently trading low** based on most short and long-term technical indicators.
    *   The share price is comfortably above its key moving averages (8-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages), all of which signal a **"Buy"** trend.
    *   However, some indicators suggest a **short-term extreme rally** and that the stock is **"Extreme Overbought"** and approaching **resistance**, which could indicate a potential pause, consolidation, or reversal in the immediate future.

3.  **Significant Recent Price Movement (Up Bigly):** The stock has experienced a significant increase in the last few months, notably a sharp rally in late November 2025.
    *   The primary driver for the recent surge was the announcement that **Leonard Green & Partners** acquired a **60% minority stake** in its **Topgolf and Toptracer business**, valuing the segment at **\$1.1 billion**.
    *   This deal was viewed positively by the market as it establishes a clear valuation floor for Topgolf, injects **\$770 million in cash**, and helps **strengthen the balance sheet** by reducing debt.

4.  **Long-Term Trend:** The stock has shown a strong bullish trend in the short to intermediate term, but a more neutral outlook in the mid-term due to various competing technical signals. The price stabilized around \$9.50 for a couple of months before the Leonard Green announcement, which sparked the latest move toward \$13.

## Long Thesis

The bullish scenario is based entirely on the successful separation of the businesses. In the near term, selling a majority stake in Topgolf delivers a large cash payment that will be used immediately to pay down the company’s heavy debt load, making the remaining public company financially healthier and safer. In the long term, the company will transform into a focused, pure-play entity known as Callaway Golf. This streamlined business will specialize in high-margin premium golf equipment and popular apparel brands (like TravisMathew). This simpler, profitable structure, free of large capital commitments, should attract new investors and lead to a significant increase in the stock's valuation. Critically, the company retains a 40% stake in Topgolf, ensuring it benefits from future growth in the entertainment business without having to fund its costly expansion.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that the announced sale of the majority Topgolf stake successfully closes by early 2026. We must also assume that the global demand for golf clubs and active lifestyle apparel remains robust, supporting the high profit margins of the Callaway and TravisMathew brands. Furthermore, the private equity owners of Topgolf must successfully improve sales and profitability at existing venues, thus increasing the value of the 40% stake the company retains.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

Based on the confirmed, up-to-date facts regarding the Topgolf separation and the performance of the core businesses, here is a critique of the long thesis and a corresponding bear case.

## Critique of the Long Thesis (Finding Holes and Faults)

The long thesis oversimplifies the transaction's financial impact and overlooks significant operational weaknesses in both the Topgolf and the remaining Callaway/Apparel segments.

1.  **Fault in "Successful Separation" & Value Creation:** The transaction values Topgolf at an implied **$1.1 billion**, which represents a steep discount (approximately 45-50% less) compared to the original **~$2.6 billion** enterprise value Callaway assigned to the business in 2021. This indicates a major destruction of shareholder value from the original merger, challenging the premise that separation automatically leads to a *significant increase* in the stock's valuation.

2.  **Fault in "Heavy Debt Load" Claim vs. Reality:** While the long thesis correctly identifies debt reduction, the company's stated goal of achieving **"approximately zero net debt"** for the post-transaction entity relies on their non-GAAP definition and is an aggressive target. Third-party credit rating agencies like Moody's project the more meaningful **Debt-to-EBITDA leverage** for the standalone Callaway business will only decline to the **mid-4x range in 2026**, which still reflects a high degree of financial risk, despite a major improvement from the prior 6.8x.

3.  **Hole in Topgolf Growth Assumption:** The core assumption that the 40% retained stake benefits from *future growth* is undercut by recent performance, as Topgolf's **same-venue sales have declined sharply**, falling 11% in Q3 2024 and 8% for the full year 2024 (though showing sequential improvement). Furthermore, the private equity partner's strategy is to "dramatically **slow new venue openings**" and focus on optimizing existing cash flow, which shifts the business from a high-growth narrative to a mature, cost-focused one.

4.  **Hole in Core Business Robustness Assumption:** The thesis assumes robust demand for golf equipment and apparel, supporting high margins. However, Q3 2024 results showed an **11% decline in the Active Lifestyle segment** (TravisMathew, etc.), driven by a decline in wholesale and European sales, and relatively flat equipment sales, suggesting discretionary consumer spending is already pressuring these "high-margin" businesses. The golf market is highly cyclical, and a slowdown could expose the remaining Callaway business while it is still deleveraging.

5.  **Flaw in "Pure-Play" Simplification:** While the transaction simplifies the corporate structure, the post-transaction Callaway Golf Company still retains the **40% minority stake** in Topgolf, which will be reported as a single line item, introducing a degree of ongoing complexity and a significant, non-core asset that could be subject to further impairment if Topgolf's turnaround under private equity fails.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG)

The bear case argues that the strategic separation fails to resolve the fundamental issues of overvaluation and demand risk in the remaining core business, leaving shareholders with a debt-burdened equipment company and a diminished, non-core stake in a mature entertainment asset.

1.  **High Debt and Recurrent Leverage Risk:** Despite receiving $770 million, the standalone Callaway Golf (CALY) business retains the primary financial debt, and third-party ratings agencies still project a high leverage ratio (Debt-to-EBITDA in the mid-4x range) in 2026. Any material downturn in the golf equipment or active lifestyle markets would cause a decline in EBITDA, immediately worsening the leverage ratio and reintroducing significant refinancing risk.

2.  **Cyclical Demand Headwinds for the Core Business:** The new, "pure-play" Callaway is highly exposed to the discretionary consumer spending cycle, which is showing signs of weakness with recent declines in the Active Lifestyle segment's sales. If global demand for golf equipment and apparel softens, Callaway's high profit margins will face severe pressure from inventory write-downs and increased promotional activity, rapidly eroding free cash flow.

3.  **Stagnating Value of Retained Topgolf Stake:** The 40% minority stake is now in a much slower-growing business. The private equity partner, Leonard Green & Partners, is focused on cost optimization and cash flow, which may not generate the kind of aggressive revenue growth that drives public market excitement and a valuation increase for the retained stake. Furthermore, the two-year lock-up period means Callaway's 40% stake cannot be easily sold to generate cash if the core business needs emergency funding.

4.  **Impairment Risk and True Valuation Reset:** The original combination resulted in a massive **$1.45 billion non-cash impairment of Topgolf's goodwill** in 2024, signaling that the true value of the Topgolf asset was far lower than the merger price. The steep valuation discount in the sale (45-50% below the 2021 acquisition price) suggests that further write-downs are possible if the PE-led turnaround fails, and the market may already be pricing the core Callaway business based on this lower, "reset" valuation, limiting immediate upside from the separation.

## Next Steps

The analysis you have completed is comprehensive and thoroughly covers the strategic pivot, historical context, and risks associated with Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG). The next steps should focus on the quantitative aspects of the post-separation company to determine the value proposition of the future "Callaway Golf Company" (CALY).

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate:

1.  **Market's Valuation of the New Callaway (CALY) Post-Separation**
    *   The stock price is currently trading near or above the average analyst price target ($\$11.56$ - $\$$12.50). You need to find the specific **pro-forma enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA multiple** the market is currently assigning to the post-separation CALY business to see if the "re-rating" has already occurred or if there is still room for upside.

2.  **Pro-Forma Financial Guidance and Growth**
    *   Management has stated the mid-point of the core Callaway/Active Lifestyle 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance is $\sim$\$200 million and that the segment had $\sim$\$2 billion in TTM revenue through Q3 2025.
    *   **Investigate the 2026 growth and margin targets.** Specifically, search for management's **projected 2026 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA** guidance for the post-separation CALY to model its future cash flow and valuation.

3.  **Peer-to-Peer Valuation Benchmarking**
    *   Acushnet (GOLF), which owns Titleist and FootJoy, is the most direct pure-play comparable. You must find and compare key financial multiples for Acushnet (GOLF) against the implied multiples for the standalone CALY business.
    *   **Specifically, search for Acushnet's (GOLF) current EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples** to determine the potential upside if CALY closes the multiple gap after separation and debt reduction.

4.  **Debt Refinancing and Financial Risk Timeline**
    *   The bear case highlights the remaining high leverage (mid-4x range) for the new CALY [cite: Bear scenario].
    *   **Investigate the upcoming debt maturity schedule for the new CALY.** Determine which significant debt tranches will need to be refinanced in 2026, 2027, and 2028, and what the potential cost of that refinancing could be, as this directly impacts the free cash flow.

5.  **Competitive and Economic Headwinds in Core Segments**
    *   The Active Lifestyle segment's (TravisMathew, OGIO) revenue declined in Q3 2025, and there's a risk of softness in discretionary spending.
    *   **Search for the current inventory levels and pricing environment** within the golf equipment and lifestyle apparel markets, as high inventories could force promotional pricing and erode the high margins that are critical to the bull case.

6.  **New Topgolf Governance and Potential for Future Impairment**
    *   The new CALY will have a **40% minority stake in Topgolf** with no operational role. The two-year lock-up means it cannot be sold immediately.
    *   **Search for the new CEO or top leadership** of the privatized Topgolf entity under Leonard Green & Partners (LGP) to gauge the quality of the turnaround team. This is crucial for evaluating the long-term value of the retained 40% stake.
