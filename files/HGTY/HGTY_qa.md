## Business Summary

Hagerty specializes in providing insurance for collectible vehicles, such as classic cars, vintage motorcycles, and antique boats. The company primarily operates as an expert intermediary, known as a managing general agent or broker, meaning they do not take on the primary financial risk of insuring the vehicle themselves. Instead, they partner with major insurance carriers (underwriters) and earn commissions and fees for connecting these collectors with specialized policies. The core customer base consists of affluent individuals and hobbyists, predominantly located in North America, who own these high-value, non-essential assets. While the majority of revenue is generated through these specialized insurance commissions, the company diversifies its income by offering memberships (like the Hagerty Drivers Club, which provides roadside assistance and valuation tools) and through media, events, and automotive valuation services.

## Business Model Risk

One near-term risk involves the company's reliance on the broader economic health of its customers. Because collectible cars are luxury, non-essential assets, an economic downturn or rising inflation may cause enthusiasts to reduce discretionary spending, leading to fewer new policies, lower coverage amounts, and reduced demand for premium membership services. A similar threat occurred in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, slowing luxury spending, and this remains a concern if recessionary pressures return. A second significant near-term risk is the potential for their underwriting partners to pull back capacity or increase reinsurance costs, which could force Hagerty to charge higher rates or limit the types of policies they can offer. The major long-term risk relates to the demographics of the collector market. The current base tends to skew older, and if younger generations do not adopt the vintage motoring hobby, or if their interests shift significantly (for example, toward modern electric vehicles or digital collectibles), the long-term pool of valuable insured assets Hagerty relies upon will gradually shrink. Lastly, Hagerty is susceptible to rapid shifts in the collectible car market values; if the current high valuations are considered a market bubble that bursts, customers may drop coverage or reduce policy limits substantially, directly harming Hagerty's premium volume and earnings.

## Company History

Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY) is now a public company, but it started as a family-run insurance agency. It is now best described as an "automotive lifestyle brand" that focuses on classic and enthusiast vehicles, rather than just an insurance company.

Here is a detailed history of the company from its inception to the present day:

### **The Founding and Early Years (Inception - 2000)**

1.  **Why the Business Was Founded (The Initial Problem):** Hagerty was founded in 1984 by Frank and Louise Hagerty in Traverse City, Michigan, because they could not find a good insurance policy for their antique wooden boats.
2.  **The First Innovative Solution:** They solved this problem by creating their own specialized insurance company to protect collectible assets that traditional insurance companies didn't understand or value properly.
3.  **The Pivot to Cars:** In 1991, the company made a strategic shift, applying their specialized insurance model to the classic and collector car market, which also lacked suitable coverage. This move defined the company's future.
4.  **Specialized Insurance Model (Core Solution):** Unlike standard auto insurance, Hagerty's policies offered an "agreed value coverage," meaning the company agrees on the vehicle’s value upfront, ensuring the owner is paid that full amount if the car is a total loss, rather than a depreciated market value.

### **The Transition to a Lifestyle Brand (2000 - 2017)**

5.  **New Leadership and Vision:** In 2000, McKeel Hagerty, the founders’ son, became the CEO and began transforming the company beyond just an insurance provider into a comprehensive automotive lifestyle brand.
6.  **Tailwind: Leveraging Niche Expertise:** The company was fortunate to have a wealth of internal data on collector vehicles, allowing them to accurately value and price risk, giving them a significant advantage over competitors.
7.  **Innovation: The Valuation Tool:** In 2008, Hagerty released its annual Hagerty Price Guide and Valuation Tool, which became an industry standard for tracking collectible vehicle values, further cementing the company's position as an expert in the market.
8.  **Innovation: Building Community and Loyalty:** A pivotal move was the launch of the Hagerty Drivers Club (HDC) membership program in 2009, which created a loyal community of enthusiasts and diversified the company's revenue beyond just insurance premiums.
9.  **Further Expansion of the Ecosystem:** The company established a media arm to publish magazines and create high-quality digital content, which attracted more enthusiasts and strengthened the brand’s connection to car culture.
10. **Headwind and Resilience (2008 Financial Crisis):** During the economic downturn of 2008-2009, which hit many businesses hard, Hagerty's enthusiast-focused model showed resilience, continuing to grow written premiums, although at a slower rate than their target.

### **Expansion and Going Public (2017 - Present)**

11. **Refined Corporate Goal:** In 2017, Hagerty formally adopted its mission of "saving driving and preserving automotive culture for future generations," emphasizing that their goal is to support the entire hobby, not just insure it.
12. **Expansion through Acquisition:** To build a complete "ecosystem," the company began acquiring major automotive events, such as the Greenwich Concours d'Elégance and the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance, giving members and clients exclusive experiences.
13. **New Ventures:** They branched out into related services like DriveShare (a peer-to-peer classic car rental platform) and Hagerty Garage + Social (storage facilities and social clubs for car owners).
14. **The Public Market Milestone:** In December 2021, Hagerty went public by merging with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker HGTY, which provided significant capital for accelerated growth.
15. **Headwind: Macro Challenges Post-2022:** The company faced pressure to improve profitability due to broader economic realities, which led to a strategic evaluation of investments and efforts to reduce costs.
16. **Ongoing Headwinds and Solutions:** Hagerty continues to address challenges like competition from larger insurers entering the collector niche and rising claims costs due to scarcity of classic car parts by leaning on its proprietary data and integrated ecosystem to maintain its market leadership.

### **Hagerty Today (The Goal)**

Today, Hagerty is an all-in-one platform for automotive enthusiasts, offering:
*   Specialty **Insurance**.
*   **Membership** (Hagerty Drivers Club) with roadside assistance and discounts.
*   **Media** (magazine and digital content).
*   **Events and Auctions**.

The ultimate goal is to create a vibrant, lifelong relationship with car lovers by providing everything they need, from insurance to entertainment, ultimately serving the 69 million people in the U.S. who identify as car enthusiasts.

## Moat Analysis

Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY) has built its economic moat primarily by evolving from a specialized insurance provider into a full-fledged automotive lifestyle and enthusiast brand. Its competitive advantage lies in the deep integration of its insurance business with media, membership, and data, creating a self-reinforcing "ecosystem."

### Analysis of Hagerty’s Moat and Differentiation

#### 1. Unique Integrated Ecosystem (The Flywheel)
*   Hagerty's core differentiation is its comprehensive, integrated ecosystem that extends far beyond a simple insurance policy, which is difficult for traditional or niche competitors to replicate.
*   The business model is a "flywheel" where the insurance arm funds the other, higher-engagement parts—like the media, events, and marketplace—which in turn build brand loyalty and feed new, high-quality members back into the insurance pool.

#### 2. Deep Specialization and Data Advantage
*   The company focuses on the specialty niche of classic, collector, and enthusiast vehicles, which have distinct insurance needs not well-served by general auto carriers.
*   Hagerty possesses a large, proprietary database of vehicle valuations, claims history, and enthusiast behavior built over decades, giving it unparalleled expertise for accurate underwriting and risk assessment.
*   This deep data advantage translates into a much more profitable underwriting practice, evidenced by a significantly lower loss ratio compared to the broader auto insurance industry average, which is a major financial moat.

#### 3. Pricing Power and Special Market Position
*   Hagerty’s specialization grants it a unique competitive position that isn't solely based on price; they offer a differentiated, superior product (agreed-value coverage, better claims service by experts).
*   However, their niche expertise allows them to often offer lower premiums for specialty vehicles than a standard carrier would, as they understand that enthusiasts drive their collectible cars less and take better care of them.
*   Historically, Hagerty's rate increases have been significantly lower than those of the top general auto insurance carriers, giving them a strong value proposition and a form of pricing power based on a superior, specialized product.

#### 4. High Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue
*   The customer base is highly loyal, with a policy retention rate of nearly $\text{90%}$ and an average policy life of nine years, which creates a very stable and recurring revenue stream.
*   The **Hagerty Drivers Club** (HDC), a membership program, drives recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and acts as a central hub that deepens engagement through benefits like roadside services, exclusive events, and the popular valuation tool.
*   The company's Net Promoter Score (NPS) is exceptionally high ($\text{82-83}$), a strong indicator of customer satisfaction that easily surpasses the insurance industry average (around $\text{39}$).

#### 5. Network Effects and Community Engagement
*   Hagerty has successfully built a powerful **brand** that acts as the trusted voice and central hub of car culture, moving beyond a transactional insurance relationship to an emotional one.
*   Its media content, valuation tools, and events—including ownership of major Concours d'Elegance events and their growing auction business (Hagerty Marketplace)—create multiple engagement points that foster a community and a strong "network effect" around the brand.
*   The more enthusiasts join the club, consume the content, and use the Marketplace, the more valuable the data and network become, making it harder for a new entrant to build an equivalent platform.

#### 6. Resilience to Displacement and Investment in Innovation
*   Displacement by a company with more capital is difficult because the moat is built on decades of cultivating brand trust, specialized underwriting data, and community, not just a simple product.
*   The company is actively investing in technology and innovation, launching a "Digital Labs" initiative and a multi-million-dollar investment into a modern tech stack to improve customer service, operational efficiency, and accelerate new digital products.
*   Hagerty must constantly innovate to maintain its edge by digitizing its offerings and using data insights (including AI) to engage younger generations of enthusiasts who are starting to collect newer vehicles.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that could increase Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY) stock price are centered around its expanding insurance capacity, new distribution partnerships, and the growth of its broader enthusiast ecosystem.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12–18 Months)

1.  **Improved Economics from Markel Partnership:** Management has highlighted the proposed new fronting arrangement with Markel, which is expected to result in Hagerty taking on 100% of the premium by 2026. This change is a key financial catalyst that is "well positioned for accelerating rates of top and bottom line growth" and should lead to better profitability and margin expansion.
2.  **State Farm Partnership Expansion:** The rollout of the State Farm Classic Plus program is a major near-term driver for policy growth, with management noting its planned expansion to 25 states by the end of 2025. This allows Hagerty to access State Farm's large customer base and significantly increase its policy count.
3.  **Revenue and Profit Outlook Increase:** After the second quarter of 2025, the company raised its full-year guidance, projecting revenue growth of 13-14%, net income growth of 43-53%, and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 30-38%. This signals strong business momentum and execution that is expected to drive earnings growth in the near term.
4.  **Operating Leverage and Margin Expansion:** The company is showing progress toward its goal of revenue growth outpacing expense growth, which is expected to expand operating margins faster than originally anticipated. Management explicitly forecasts EBITDA margins will likely grow into the mid-teens.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Policy and Market Share Growth:** Hagerty is targeting to double its policy count to 3 million by February 2029, a long-term goal that underscores its continued focus on taking market share in the specialty vehicle insurance niche. This strategy leverages its expertise in underwriting collector cars, a market with strong customer loyalty.
2.  **Expansion of the Enthusiast Ecosystem:** The company's long-term strategy involves growing its non-insurance businesses, including its membership (Hagerty Drivers Club), valuation data, and live/digital auction services (Broad Arrow). These components create a durable competitive advantage by engaging the enthusiast community and generating additional recurring revenue.
3.  **Technology Investment for Scalability:** Management is investing heavily in a shift to a modern, cloud-based IT infrastructure to streamline operations and enhance member services. This major overhaul is a long-term initiative intended to provide future efficiency and the necessary scalability for aggressive growth.
4.  **International and New Product Expansion:** Continued geographic expansion, particularly into the European market, and the introduction of new insurance programs like the "Enthusiast Plus" business are expected to open new revenue streams. The company's global events and auctions also support its international growth strategy.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Hagerty, Inc.'s (HGTY) management incentive and compensation is based on its recent proxy statements, highlighting key aspects of insider ownership and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Control (Alignment with Shareholders)**

1.  **High Controlling Ownership:** Hagerty, Inc. is classified as a "controlled company" under NYSE rules because Hagerty Holding Corp. ("HHC") beneficially owns more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock. This structure means the company is controlled by the founding family and related entities, establishing a high degree of control and intrinsic alignment with long-term company value, as their wealth is tied directly to the stock's performance.
2.  **CEO's Personal Stake:** The CEO, McKeel Hagerty, holds a personal equity stake, which the Compensation Committee specifically noted as creating a "strong alignment with the interests of other stockholders" when justifying changes to his compensation.
3.  **Insider Trading Transparency:** Director Robert I. Kauffman reported sales of Class A common stock executed under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which is generally viewed as a mechanism to reduce information asymmetry and planned sales.

#### **2. Compensation Structure (Pay-for-Performance)**

1.  **Performance-Based Annual Incentives:** The Annual Incentive Plan is designed to promote a "pay-for-performance culture," with metrics tied directly to company financial results. For 2023, the plan was weighted heavily toward **operating income (75%)** and **total revenue growth (25%)**.
2.  **Equity-Focused Total Pay:** The CEO's total compensation for 2024 was significantly composed of bonuses and equity, with only about 26.5% as base salary and 73.5% in bonuses, stock, and options, emphasizing a focus on non-cash, performance-driven rewards.
3.  **Long-Term Equity Focus:** Long-term compensation includes equity awards such as Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)**. The inclusion of PSUs, which vest only upon achieving specific, multi-year performance goals, is a direct mechanism for aligning executive pay with sustainable long-term shareholder value creation.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentives**

1.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholder Interests:** Management has a significant incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders, primarily because of the company's "controlled company" status, where the founding family and related entities hold majority voting power, tying their vast personal wealth to the stock's long-term appreciation.
2.  **Focus on Financial Performance:** The compensation structure reinforces this alignment by linking a substantial portion of executive pay, particularly annual bonuses and long-term equity, directly to key financial metrics like operating income and revenue growth, which are crucial drivers of shareholder value.
3.  **Incentive to Line Own Pockets (Balanced):** While all executives are incentivized to be highly compensated, the structure is designed such that lining their pockets is directly proportional to creating value for *all* shareholders through sustained financial and stock performance, rather than through short-term or easily manipulated non-financial metrics.

## Price History

Based on the current data and technical analysis, here is an analysis of Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY) stock price history and current status.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The last reported closing price (as of September 26, 2025) was \$12.01. The stock's 52-week trading range is between a low of \$8.03 and a high of \$13.32.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY) is currently trading approximately **49.56%** above its 52-week low of \$8.03.

3.  **Technical Status – Is it Trading Low?** The stock is not technically trading "low" in an absolute sense, as it is closer to its 52-week high than its low. However, it recently experienced a short-term drop, falling for seven consecutive days and being down over 4% in the last ten days as of the latest data.

4.  **Moving Average and Trend Analysis:** Technical analysis suggests the stock is in a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, with a general "buy" signal from the long-term Moving Averages. However, there is a "sell" signal from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, suggesting mixed signals.

5.  **Resistance and Support Levels:** The stock faces short-term resistance near the \$12.38 level, while it finds initial support at approximately \$11.68 and stronger support around \$11.32.

6.  **Recent Stock Rally Explanation:** The stock made a strong move in the last few months, reaching its 52-week high of \$13.32 on September 17, 2025. This upward trend was significantly fueled by the company's Q2 2025 earnings report in early August, where it **beat earnings expectations** and *increased* its full-year outlook for revenue and profit growth.

7.  **Recent Price Drop/Concerns:** Despite the positive corporate performance and long-term trend, the stock has recently pulled back. This decline may be related to significant insider selling, where major shareholders and directors sold over 11 million shares for a total value exceeding \$107 million in the last three months.

8.  **Analyst Consensus:** The consensus rating among surveyed analysts is "Hold," with an average 12-month price target set at \$13.20. This target implies limited near-term upside from the current price.

## Long Thesis

Hagerty is moving beyond being just an insurer for classic cars to become the central, trusted brand for all automotive enthusiasts. In the near term, growth will accelerate significantly by using major partnerships, like State Farm, to access millions of new customers and rapidly increase the number of policies they write. Crucially, they are simultaneously restructuring their insurance deals, which is expected to drastically increase their profitability and operating efficiency starting next year. Long term, the bull case rests on the self-reinforcing 'ecosystem' they have built, combining insurance with high-margin recurring membership fees, exclusive events, and media content. This ecosystem creates an exceptionally loyal customer base (high retention rates) and provides Hagerty with superior data, which allows them to offer better policies than general insurers. Management aims to leverage this stickiness and data advantage to double the policy count by 2030, capturing a huge share of the global enthusiast market and generating stable, high-margin revenue.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario assumes that the classic and collector car hobby successfully continues to attract younger generations, offsetting demographic risks. It requires management to successfully execute on its ambitious growth targets, including efficiently rolling out the State Farm partnership across the country and delivering the promised margin expansion from the new Markel arrangement. Economic conditions must remain stable enough that affluent collectors continue to value and insure luxury, non-essential assets. Finally, Hagerty must successfully leverage its proprietary data and technology investments to maintain its market dominance and high customer loyalty against any large general insurers that attempt to enter the niche market.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several faults and execution risks in the optimistic long thesis for Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY), forming a bear case primarily based on dependency on future execution, economic volatility of high-margin segments, and potential for competitive erosion.

### Bear Case Thesis: Hagerty, Inc. (HGTY)

1.  **High Execution Risk of Deferred Profitability and Growth:** The thesis hinges on two major, future events: the successful and full integration of the multi-million-policy State Farm partnership and the realization of drastic margin expansion from the Markel agreement starting in 2026. Any delays, unforeseen costs, or failure to efficiently onboard State Farm customers could significantly delay the promised acceleration in revenue and profitability.

2.  **Increased Financial Volatility from High-Margin Ecosystem:** The non-insurance parts of the "ecosystem" (Marketplace/Auctions and Events) are the highest-margin revenue streams, yet they are also the most sensitive to economic conditions and discretionary spending. A sustained economic downturn would likely depress collector car values and auction volume, which are volatile by nature, undercutting the narrative of stable, high-margin revenue.

3.  **Demographic Interest vs. Buying Power Disconnect:** While company data suggests high interest from younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials), their current purchasing power to acquire and insure high-value, non-essential collector vehicles may not be sufficient to drive the aggressive growth needed to *double* the policy count by 2030.

4.  **Data and Technology Advantage is Not Exclusive or Immediate:** The superior data advantage Hagerty possesses is not an impenetrable moat; larger general insurers (like Progressive or Geico) could choose to aggressively enter the niche, either by acquiring a competitor or by leveraging their massive data sets and capital to quickly build a competitive specialized product. Furthermore, the company's $20 million investment in a new technology platform (Duck Creek) is a near-term cost that puts pressure on margins before the efficiency gains are realized.

5.  **Competitive Pressure and Membership Fatigue:** Hagerty's model includes a mandatory or encouraged paid membership (Hagerty Drivers Club) for its full "ecosystem" benefits. Niche competitors, such as American Collectors Insurance, have historically offered similar agreed-value specialty insurance without an additional membership fee, which could be a pricing advantage that limits Hagerty's ability to cross-sell and extract recurring revenue from new customers.

6.  **Capital Risk of Assuming 100% Underwriting Risk (Markel):** The new Markel deal, while promising a higher share of underwriting profits, also increases the company's exposure by having Hagerty Re assume 100% of the underwriting risk. This shift makes the company more susceptible to claims volatility (like the wildfire losses noted in recent earnings), potentially introducing a higher risk profile for a company whose main advantage is supposedly its superior underwriting.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis you've conducted is thorough and has successfully validated the core assumption of the long thesis (youth enthusiasm) and confirmed the financial mechanics of the major catalyst (Markel deal). The remaining gaps are highly quantitative and relate to the immediate execution risks.

Here are the most important questions still left unanswered and the logical next steps for your investigation:

### **Important Unanswered Questions and Next Steps**

#### **1. Quantifying the State Farm Partnership Success (Near-Term Execution)**

*   **Question:** What is the actual, proven policy conversion rate for the State Farm Classic+ program?
*   **Context:** The major near-term catalyst relies on accelerating growth in the second half of 2025 by rolling out State Farm Classic+ to over 25 states. Hagerty has mentioned an initial policy target of around **460,000+ policies** from State Farm's book, but there is no public disclosure on the rate at which they are successfully converting (or "onboarding") customers from the initial four-state pilot into Hagerty-serviced policies.
*   **Action:** Investigate recent (post-Q2 2025) analyst research reports or conference transcripts (other than the Q2 call) to see if management provided a specific, quantitative metric on policy additions attributed to State Farm or a conversion rate metric during investor conferences.

#### **2. Financial Modeling Impact of the Markel Deal (Profitability Quantification)**

*   **Question:** What is the specific, estimated dollar impact (e.g., incremental Adjusted EBITDA/Net Income) that Hagerty expects to gain from assuming the remaining 20% of the underwriting profit/investment economics in 2026?
*   **Context:** While the qualitative benefit is clear—assuming 100% of the profitable underwriting risk (loss ratio around 42% on older data) and reducing the Markel fronting fee from the prior structure's complexity—management has not publicly attached a firm dollar value to this increase. Calculating this value is essential for accurate 2026/2027 financial models.
*   **Action:** Try to find a detailed analyst model or an archived investor presentation from July/August 2025 that explicitly attempts to model the P&L impact of the 100% assumption, which can be used to back-calculate management's internal expectations.

#### **3. Rationale for Major Insider Selling (Short-Term Sentiment Risk)**

*   **Question:** Is there a specific, non-generic reason (beyond a Rule 10b5-1 plan) for the recent, large-scale sales totaling over **\$107 million** by major shareholders, particularly Hagerty Holding Corp. and Director Robert I. Kauffman?
*   **Context:** This level of selling, despite the pre-planned nature, is a significant technical headwind that creates negative market sentiment and is mentioned in the stock price analysis. The rationale is crucial to understanding whether the insiders are simply diversifying their wealth (the bull case explanation) or signaling a valuation peak.
*   **Action:** Search for any accompanying press releases, Form 4 footnotes, or mentions in subsequent analyst calls/interviews where the major selling shareholders or CEO addressed the nature of the large-volume sales in August/September 2025.

#### **4. Catastrophe Risk Exposure (Bear Case Mitigation/Risk Control)**

*   **Question:** How has Hagerty formally mitigated the increased catastrophe (CAT) risk, given the Markel deal makes them responsible for 100% of the risk, and management explicitly called out a **\$10 million pre-tax impact** from Southern California wildfires in their 2025 outlook?
*   **Context:** The bear case highlights the risk of assuming 100% risk and the impact of recent wildfire losses. The long thesis's superior underwriting is only sustainable if the reinsurance structure is robust for CAT events.
*   **Action:** Investigate Hagerty Re's specific reinsurance program details. Search for its "Reinsurance Retrocession" structure and its relationship with its A-rated AM Best score to assess the buffer against future large-scale events like wildfires or hurricanes.
