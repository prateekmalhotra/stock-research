### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projection Justification**

For an investment company like STEW, the "Revenue" is the **Total Investment Return** (Net Investment Income + Realized/Unrealized Gains) on its Net Assets (NAV). The "business engine" is the Fund's active, value-driven, low-turnover investment strategy.

#### **Assumptions for the Business Engine:**

1.  **Projected Annual Return on Net Assets (RONA) / "Revenue"**: The Fund's investment objective is total return, and its management commentary highlights a history of outperforming its benchmark (S&P 500) and a **five-year average annual NAV total return of $17.84\%$** (as of Sep 30, 2025). A conservative and reasonable estimate, moderating this exceptional performance, is assumed.
    *   **Conservative RONA (Gross Return) Assumption: 10.0%**
2.  **Total Expense Ratio ("Gross Margin to Net Income")**: The Net Income is the gross return less the fund's operating expenses. The total expense ratio is **1.49\%** of common assets.
3.  **Net Return on Net Assets (Pre-Distribution)**:
    *   $10.0\%$ (RONA) - $1.49\%$ (Expenses) = **8.51\%** (This is the growth rate of the NAV if no distributions were paid).

#### **Cash Flow for DCF (FCFE Calculation):**

The Net Income for a CEF is the total appreciation/profit. To get Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), we must subtract the distributions paid to shareholders, as this is the cash flow that leaves the business and is not reinvested.

*   **Annual Distribution per Share:** \$0.66 (Quarterly distribution of \$0.165, which started in Jan 2025).
*   **Total Annual Distributions:** $96.44 \text{M shares} \times \$0.66/\text{share} = \mathbf{\$63.65 \text{ Million}}$

| Year | Starting NAV (Millions USD) | Projected RONA (10.0%) / "Revenue" (Millions USD) | Net Return (8.51%) / "Net Income" (Millions USD) | Annual Distributions (Millions USD) | Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Start) | $2,116.891$ | - | - | - | - |
| **2025** (End) | $2,116.891$ | $211.69$ | $180.16$ | $63.65$ | **$116.51$** |
| **2026** (End) | $2,233.401$ | $223.34$ | $190.17$ | $63.65$ | **$126.52$** |
| **2027** (End) | $2,359.929$ | $235.99$ | $200.83$ | $63.65$ | **$137.18$** |
| **2028** (End) | $2,500.563$ | $250.06$ | $212.78$ | $63.65$ | **$149.13$** |
| **2029** (End) | $2,650.035$ | $265.00$ | $225.59$ | $63.65$ | **$161.94$** |
| **2030** (End) | $2,811.977$ | $281.20$ | $239.38$ | $63.65$ | **$175.73$** |

*Calculation Notes:*
*   *Starting NAV (Year N+1) = Ending NAV (Year N) = Starting NAV (Year N) + FCFE (Year N) + Annual Distributions (Year N)*. This maintains the accounting identity that the FCFE is the growth of the fund's capital, which is reinvested.
*   *Net Return ("Net Income") = Starting NAV * 8.51\%*
*   *FCFE = Net Return - Annual Distributions*

### **III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

#### **DCF Assumptions:**

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable)**: For a closed-end fund with a concentrated portfolio of equity and fixed income, and a beta of $0.96$, a conservative but reasonable Cost of Equity (as the fund uses low leverage) is applied.
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** $\approx 4.5\%$
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** $\approx 6.0\%$
    *   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC proxy):** **$10.0\%$** (This is a reasonable choice for a highly-concentrated, actively-managed fund that has outperformed its benchmark historically).
2.  **Maturity Rate (Conservative)**: A very conservative Terminal Growth Rate is assumed for the investment vehicle's cash flows beyond 2030, reflecting long-term global economic growth and inflation.
    *   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **$2.5\%$**

#### **Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**

Terminal Value (TV) = FCFE for 2030 * (1 + g) / (r - g)
TV = $175.73 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.025) / (0.10 - 0.025)$
TV = $175.73 \text{M} \times 1.025 / 0.075$
TV = **$2,398.71$ Million USD**

#### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year | FCFE (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of FCFE (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $116.51$ | $0.909$ | $105.91$ |
| **2026** | $126.52$ | $0.826$ | $104.55$ |
| **2027** | $137.18$ | $0.751$ | $103.02$ |
| **2028** | $149.13$ | $0.683$ | $101.83$ |
| **2029** | $161.94$ | $0.621$ | $100.58$ |
| **2030 (FCFE)** | $175.73$ | $0.564$ | $99.18$ |
| **2030 (TV)** | $2,398.71$ | $0.564$ | $1,352.88$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$1,867.95$ Million USD** |

### **IV. Fair Value Calculation and Justification**

#### **Fair Value Calculation:**

Fair Value (Equity) = Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Starting Net Assets (NAV) - Debt
*Note: For a CEF, the NPV of future cash flows is the value of the 'earnings engine.' The starting NAV represents the current asset value, which must be added back, as the cash flows were only based on the *growth* and *distributions* of that asset base.*

This is equivalent to a traditional valuation where you add the current Enterprise Value to the discounted future cash flows, but adjusted for the fund's specific structure.

$$
\text{Fair Value (Equity)} = (\text{Total NPV of FCFE}) - (\text{Total Debt}) + (\text{Starting NAV})
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value (Equity)} = \$1,867.95 \text{M} - \$223.645 \text{M} + \$2,116.891 \text{M}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value (Equity)} = \mathbf{\$3,761.196 \text{ Million}}
$$

| Metric | Calculation | Value (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\$3,761.196 \text{M} / 96.44 \text{M shares}$ | **$38.99** |

### **V. Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value (USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **$38.99** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$17.39** |
| **Current NAV per Share** | **$21.95** |

#### **Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Value**

My calculated Fair Value of **\$38.99** per share is significantly higher than both the Current Stock Price (\$17.39) and the Current Net Asset Value (NAV) per Share (\$21.95).

**The key reasons for this significant difference are:**

1.  **Model Conflict (CEF vs. DCF):** The requested DCF methodology, which discounts *future* cash flows (FCFE based on a 10.0\% RONA) over a long horizon and adds it to the current liquid asset base, is not the standard valuation method for a CEF. The standard valuation for a CEF is the **Net Asset Value (NAV)**.
2.  **Market's Valuation Basis (NAV):** The market currently values STEW at a **discount of approximately 20.9\%** to its NAV ($17.39 vs. $21.95). The market is pricing the shares based on the current liquidation value (NAV) and applying a typical discount due to management fees, liquidity constraints, and general market sentiment for CEFs.
3.  **Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. DCF Assumptions:**
    *   **Market Implicitly Assumes:** The fund's expected long-term performance is only enough to justify the current NAV, minus a discount to compensate for the market-price risk and expenses. It is *not* fully valuing the long-term compounding growth potential.
    *   **My DCF Assumes:** A long-term Net Return on Net Assets (RONA) of $8.51\%$ and a Terminal Growth Rate of $2.5\%$. This model, by its nature, *fully* capitalizes the present value of **all future value-creation** from the fund's assets into the price today. By calculating the value of the assets *plus* the value of the asset manager's ability to generate compounding excess returns (alpha), the DCF value logically exceeds the static NAV.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated DCF fair value of **\$38.99** represents a best-case scenario based on a conservative but consistent $8.51\%$ net return and a $2.5\%$ perpetual growth rate for the entire fund over a long horizon. While mathematically sound based on the user's rules, it is a highly theoretical value for a CEF.

The market's reality for STEW is a value closer to its **NAV per share of \$21.95** minus a persistent market discount. The difference highlights the market's skepticism (the **20.9\% discount**) about the value of the active management and the permanence of the fund's outperformance, as investors prefer the simple liquidation value over the long-term compounded FCFE.

**The Fair Value for SRH Total Return Fund, Inc. (STEW) stock, based on the requested Discounted Cash Flow methodology, is $38.99 per share.**
