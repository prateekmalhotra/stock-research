This valuation is performed for SRH Total Return Fund, Inc. (STEW), which is a **Closed-End Investment Company (CEF)**. The nature of this entity fundamentally changes the application of a traditional Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model intended for an operating business. The fair value of a CEF's stock is primarily based on its **Net Asset Value (NAV)**, which represents the marked-to-market value of its underlying liquid assets (investments) minus liabilities. The market price trades at a discount or premium to this NAV.

I have adapted the user's required methodology as closely as possible to the reality of valuing a CEF, with justification for each step.

## 1. Current Financials (Adapted for CEF)

A closed-end fund's assets are almost entirely composed of liquid, marketable securities, which are the equivalent of "cash and cash equivalents" in the context of a valuation.

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Market Price** | $18.28 / share (as of Feb 9, 2026) | Current trading price. |
| **Current Net Asset Value (NAV)** | $23.35 / share (as of Feb 9, 2026) | The true intrinsic value of the underlying assets. |
| **Total Net Assets (NAV)** | ~$2.20 Billion (as of Dec 31, 2025) | Fund's total equity/invested capital. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 96,440,000 | Implied by the Market Cap ($1.76B) / Share Price ($18.25), using the approximate float of 96.44M. |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$2.20 Billion** | **Proxy:** The entire Net Assets are highly liquid investments, treated as "cash" for the purpose of this valuation. |
| **Total Debt** | **$0** | **Conservative Assumption:** The fund's balance sheet does not explicitly list large-scale long-term debt (leverage), which is common for unleveraged CEFs. Total Net Assets (NAV) already accounts for all short-term liabilities. |

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue/Net Income Projection

### Business Engine Justification

The "business engine" of SRH Total Return Fund, Inc. is its **Total Return on Net Asset Value (NAV)**, generated by its portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities. The fund is benchmarked against the S&P 500 Index and has a history of outperformance. The key performance drivers are:
1.  **Underlying Market Performance:** The return of the global equity/fixed-income markets.
2.  **Management Alpha:** The ability of Paralel Advisors LLC/Rocky Mountain Advisers, LLC to select securities (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Microsoft) that outperform the benchmark.

### Revenue and Net Income Projection

In a CEF, **Total Return** (Net Investment Income + Realized/Unrealized Gains) is the most suitable proxy for the "Net Income" or free cash flow generated by the investment portfolio.

*   **Historical Performance (NAV Return):** The 10-year average annual NAV return is **+12.5%**.
*   **Conservative Future Assumption:** I will conservatively project the annual **Total Return on NAV** (proxy for Net Income) to be **10.0%** of the prior year's NAV. This is a conservative figure, lower than the 10-year average of 12.5% and the 35.47% return in 2024, and slightly above the long-term S&P 500 average to account for the management's historical alpha.

*   **Projection of NAV (Invested Capital) and Net Income (Total Return)**
    *   **Starting NAV (Year 2024):** \$2.20 Billion (Implied from recent \$23.35 NAV per share and 94.2M shares).
    *   **Net Income (N.I.) = NAV * 10.0%**
    *   **New NAV = Old NAV + Net Income** (as per the rule: "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year").

| Year | Starting NAV (Billions) | Projected Net Income (Total Return) (Billions) (10.0% of NAV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2.20 | $0.220 |
| **2026** | $2.42 | $0.242 |
| **2027** | $2.66 | $0.266 |
| **2028** | $2.93 | $0.293 |
| **2029** | $3.22 | $0.322 |
| **2030** | $3.54 | $0.354 |

### Margin Justification

The margin concept is not applicable here as the "Net Income" (Total Return) already includes the expense ratio (1.42% Gross Expense Ratio), which is netted out of the gross investment returns. Therefore, the projected 10.0% return is a "Net Income %" of the NAV.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | **10.0%** | **Conservative (but Reasonable):** A standard rate often used for long-term equity returns, representing a reasonable cost of equity for a diversified, long-only investment fund. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | **2.5%** | **Very Conservative:** Well below the expected long-term global GDP growth rate and the projected NAV growth, reflecting a very cautious terminal value. |

### DCF Calculation

The Projected Net Income (Total Return) is treated as the Annual Cash Flow (CF).

| Year | Cash Flow (CF) (Billions) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) of CF (Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $0.220 | 0.909 | $0.200 |
| **2026** | $0.242 | 0.826 | $0.200 |
| **2027** | $0.266 | 0.751 | $0.200 |
| **2028** | $0.293 | 0.683 | $0.200 |
| **2029** | $0.322 | 0.621 | $0.200 |
| **2030** | $0.354 | 0.564 | $0.200 |

| **Sum of NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | **$1.200 Billion** |
| :--- | :--- |

### Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030. In the case of a CEF, this is simply the *Terminal NAV* discounted back to the present.

*   **NAV at end of 2030:** $3.54 Billion
*   **Terminal Value (using Gordon Growth Model on Cash Flow):**
    $$
    TV = \frac{CF_{2031}}{Discount Rate - Maturity Rate}
    $$
    $$
    CF_{2031} = CF_{2030} \times (1 + Maturity Rate) = \$0.354 \times (1 + 0.025) = \$0.363 \text{ Billion}
    $$
    $$
    TV = \frac{\$0.363 \text{ Billion}}{0.100 - 0.025} = \frac{\$0.363 \text{ Billion}}{0.075} = \$4.840 \text{ Billion}
    $$
*   **NPV of Terminal Value:**
    $$
    \text{NPV of TV} = TV \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$4.840 \text{ Billion} \times 0.564 = \$2.730 \text{ Billion}
    $$

### Total Fair Value Calculation (NPV)

$$
\text{NPV of all Future Cash Flows} = \text{Sum of NPV of CFs} + \text{NPV of TV}
$$
$$
\text{NPV of all Future Cash Flows} = \$1.200 \text{ Billion} + \$2.730 \text{ Billion} = \mathbf{\$3.930 \text{ Billion}}
$$

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Conclusion

### Fair Value of Equity

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{NPV of all Future Cash Flows} - \text{Total Debt}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$3.930 \text{ Billion} - \$0 = \mathbf{\$3.930 \text{ Billion}}
$$

### Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$3,930,000,000}{96,440,000 \text{ shares}} = \mathbf{\$40.75 / \text{share}}
$$

## Final Valuation and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price (Feb 9, 2026)** | **$18.28** |
| **Current NAV per Share (Intrinsic Value)** | **$23.35** |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **$40.75** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

My calculated Fair Value of **$40.75 per share** is significantly higher than both the **Current Market Price of $18.28** and the **Current Net Asset Value (NAV) of $23.35**.

**Why the Discrepancy? Market Assumptions vs. My Assumptions**

The market is making two primary, fundamental assumptions about STEW:

1.  **The CEF Discount:** SRH Total Return Fund, Inc. is trading at a significant discount to its current, marked-to-market NAV (21.71% discount). The market is saying the fund's liquid assets are only worth $18.28 per share, even though their balance sheet shows they are worth $23.35 per share. The market is likely assuming this discount will *persist indefinitely* due to general market inefficiency, lack of investor demand for the specific fund, or low confidence in the management's ability to maintain distributions/returns.

2.  **Long-Term Growth Rate Assumption:** The market is **NOT** making an assumption of 10.0% perpetual growth in NAV (Total Return).
    *   **Current NAV (Intrinsic Value):** The value of the fund's assets today is **$23.35/share**. If the market simply assumed *zero* growth from this point onward, the price would still be $23.35 (assuming the market discount closed).
    *   **Implied Growth Rate by Market:** For the market to value the fund at $18.28, it implies a perception that the future returns are either much lower than 10.0% **OR** that the **Discount to NAV** is a permanent feature.
    *   **My Justification:** My valuation of **\$40.75** is so high because:
        *   I applied the required **DCF methodology** to project **10.0% annual growth** on the fund's NAV (its capital), which is a very aggressive assumption of compounding returns within a DCF framework over a long period.
        *   The **most rational valuation for a CEF** is its **Current NAV (\$23.35)**. The market price of **\$18.28** indicates the market believes the fair value is its current NAV, but it applies an irrational discount to that value.

**Conclusion:**

The **\$23.35** NAV per share is the most reliable, marked-to-market **Fair Value** based on the fund's current, liquid assets. My DCF Fair Value of **\$40.75** demonstrates the massive growth potential inherent in a **10.0% compounded annual return assumption** for a portfolio of highly liquid, marked-to-market assets. The market is ignoring this long-term growth by prioritizing the current **NAV Discount** and likely assuming a lower long-term return and/or higher discount rate.
