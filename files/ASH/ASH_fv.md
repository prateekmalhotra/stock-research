### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Forecast (2025-2030)

Ashland's business model is centered on being a global additives and specialty ingredients company, with a strategic focus on high-value, consumer-focused markets: **Life Sciences (Pharmaceuticals), Personal Care,** and **Specialty Additives**. The core of the business engine is:

1.  **Portfolio Optimization:** Divesting low-margin, non-core businesses (e.g., CMC, Nutraceuticals, Avoca) to create a "clean, focused platform for growth".
2.  **Strategic Innovation:** Driving growth through new product launches, particularly in pharmaceutical cellulosics (Viatel bioresorbable polymers) and biofunctionals, which command high margins.
3.  **Cost Management:** A multi-year $90 million restructuring and manufacturing optimization program is underway, with a significant P&L benefit expected to phase in over FY2025 and FY2026.

**Revenue Projections Justification:**

*   **FY 2025 (Initial Guidance):** Management narrowed its full-year fiscal 2025 sales guidance to a range of **$1.825 billion to $1.850 billion**.
    *   **Assumption:** We use the conservative midpoint of **$1.8375 billion**.
*   **FY 2026 - FY 2030 (Long-Term Growth):** Management's long-term financial aspiration for the "core business" is an approximate **5% sales CAGR**. This is a conservative yet reasonable assumption, given the focus on high-growth, high-margin end markets (pharma and personal care) which showed resilience or growth even in soft demand environments (e.g., Personal Care sales growth, Life Sciences pharma growth).
    *   **Assumption:** We use the management-guided **5.0% CAGR** for all years from 2026 through 2030.

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Basis/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,837.5 | Midpoint of Management's Narrowed FY 2025 Guidance ($1.825B - $1.850B). |
| **2026** | $1,929.4 | 5.0% CAGR (Management's long-term target) |
| **2027** | $2,025.9 | 5.0% CAGR |
| **2028** | $2,127.2 | 5.0% CAGR |
| **2029** | $2,233.5 | 5.0% CAGR |
| **2030** | $2,345.2 | 5.0% CAGR |

### 3. Net Income and ROIC Projections (2025-2030)

The valuation will use a Net Income forecast, with annual income adding to the cash balance which is then subject to an additional Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

**Net Income Margin Justification:**

Ashland's strategy is explicitly aimed at driving sustainable margin improvement through cost savings and portfolio mix.

*   **Target Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Management's long-term aspiration is for an Adjusted EBITDA margin **over 25%**. Q3 2025 Adjusted EBITDA margin was already **24.4%**, with the high-margin Life Sciences segment achieving 33%.
*   **Cost Savings:** The restructuring program is expected to yield approximately **$90 million** in savings by FY 2027.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 6.0% | Conservative projection based on historical performance and management's cost savings ($20M in FY25) starting to flow through. Historical TTM Net Margin was highly negative due to a non-cash goodwill impairment, so a normalized positive margin is necessary for future profitability. |
| **2026** | 7.0% | Reflects the full impact of FY2025 savings, $12M in carryover benefits for FY26, and continued operational discipline, moving toward the 25%+ EBITDA target. |
| **2027-2030** | 8.0% | Represents a conservative long-term stabilized Net Income Margin, significantly below its 25%+ Adjusted EBITDA target, to reflect the full amortization, depreciation, and tax burden that is not captured in EBITDA, even after the full $90M in savings is realized by FY27.

**ROIC Assumption Justification:**

The Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) ROIC has been reported at **2.38%** [cite: 2 (from step 2)]. Given the management's focus on high-value products and improved profitability, a slightly more optimistic but still conservative ROIC is warranted for future income on accumulated cash flows.

*   **Assumption:** A conservative **3.0% ROIC** is used, reflecting the new focused, high-margin portfolio strategy.

**Net Income Projection Table (USD Millions):**

| Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC on Prior NI\* (B) | Total Net Income (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,837.5 | 6.0% | $110.3 | $0.0 | $110.3 |
| **2026** | $1,929.4 | 7.0% | $135.1 | $3.3 | $138.4 |
| **2027** | $2,025.9 | 8.0% | $162.1 | $7.4 | $169.5 |
| **2028** | $2,127.2 | 8.0% | $170.2 | $12.5 | $182.7 |
| **2029** | $2,233.5 | 8.0% | $178.7 | $18.0 | $196.7 |
| **2030** | $2,345.2 | 8.0% | $187.6 | $24.0 | $211.6 |

*   *ROIC on Prior NI Calculation: Net Income from prior year (cash) * 3.0% ROIC. For 2026: ($110.3 * 3.0%) = $3.3. For 2027: ($110.3 + $138.4) * 3.0% = $7.4, etc.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

**Discount Rate and Terminal Growth Rate Justification:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC proxy):** A **10.0%** discount rate is assumed. This is a reasonable and conservative rate for a specialty chemicals company undergoing restructuring and facing current volume headwinds, reflecting the cost of equity and debt.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative long-term growth rate of **2.0%** is used. This is well below the long-term sales CAGR target of 5% and represents the expected long-term inflation and GDP growth rate, aligning with the "very conservative maturity rate" instruction.

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (USD Millions):**

The Net Cash Flow (NCF) is assumed to be equal to the Total Net Income (as per instruction).

| Year | NCF (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $110.3 | 0.909 | $100.27 |
| **2026** | $138.4 | 0.826 | $114.33 |
| **2027** | $169.5 | 0.751 | $127.20 |
| **2028** | $182.7 | 0.683 | $124.78 |
| **2029** | $196.7 | 0.621 | $122.15 |
| **2030** | $211.6 | 0.564 | $119.33 |
| **Sum of Projected NPVs (2025-2030):** | | | **$708.06** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

*   **2030 NCF:** $211.6 million
*   **Terminal Value:** (2030 NCF \* (1 + Growth Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)
*   TV = ($211.6 \* (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02) = $215.83 / 0.08 = **$2,697.88 million**

**Terminal Value NPV:**

*   **TV NPV:** Terminal Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Terminal Year)
*   TV NPV = $2,697.88 / (1.10)^(6) = **$1,523.00 million**

**Total Equity Value (TEV):**

*   TEV = Sum of Projected NPVs + TV NPV
*   TEV = $708.06 million + $1,523.00 million = **$2,231.06 million**

### 5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (TEV)** | $2,231.06 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $219.0 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $1,313.0 |
| **Calculated Fair Market Value (FMV) of Equity** | **$1,137.06 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 50.13 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** (FMV / Shares Outstanding) | **$22.68** |

***

## Final Valuation and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $22.68**
**Current Stock Price: $50.71**

### Justification for Discrepancy

My conservative DCF valuation suggests a **Fair Value of $22.68 per share**, which is significantly lower than the current market price of **$50.71**.

The market is making assumptions that are significantly more aggressive than the conservative model built on management's explicitly stated long-term targets:

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Long-Term Growth (Higher Terminal Value):**
    *   **My Assumption:** 5.0% sales CAGR for the forecast period, and a very conservative 2.0% terminal growth rate.
    *   **Market's Likely Assumption:** For the stock price to be $50.71, the market is likely discounting a future cash flow stream that assumes a *much higher* perpetual growth rate, possibly in the range of **3.5% - 4.0%** (closer to its stated 5% CAGR target). This assumes the company will successfully transition to a high-growth "specialty chemicals" pure-play and maintain a growth rate well above GDP for decades.
2.  **Market Assumes Faster and Higher Margin Expansion:**
    *   **My Assumption:** A gradual increase to an 8.0% Net Income Margin by 2027.
    *   **Market's Likely Assumption:** The market is likely pricing in a swift conversion of the 25%+ Adjusted EBITDA target into a much higher Net Income Margin, perhaps **10% to 12%** or more, starting much sooner than 2027. This reflects high confidence in the full realization of the $90 million in cost savings and the high-margin profile of the pharmaceutical segment (Life Sciences' 33% EBITDA margin).
3.  **Market Assumes Successful Execution of Strategic Transformation:**
    *   The market is taking management's commentary about the "clean, focused platform for growth" and "advancing new technology platforms" as truth, assigning a premium for a high-quality specialty portfolio. My valuation is cautious, reflecting the current sales decline and the non-cash goodwill impairment charges which signal recent struggles in achieving book value.

**Conclusion:**

My valuation is deeply conservative. It values the company based on a floor-level perpetuity growth rate and a slow, conservative build-up to a moderate single-digit net income margin, even though management is guiding for 25%+ EBITDA margins. The market's valuation of $50.71 reflects a substantial **"Execution Premium"** that prices in the successful and full realization of all cost-saving, portfolio optimization, and innovation-driven growth targets, leading to a long-term, high-margin growth rate closer to its 5% CAGR. For a risk-averse investor, the current stock price appears overvalued based on a strict and conservative interpretation of the public guidance.
