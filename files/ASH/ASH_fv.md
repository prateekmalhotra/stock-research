## 2. Business Engine and Conservative Future Assumptions

Ashland's business engine is driven by its strategic shift to a high-value, high-margin specialty chemicals portfolio, primarily centered on three segments: **Life Sciences**, **Personal Care**, and **Specialty Additives**. The company has completed its portfolio optimization (divestitures like Avoca) to focus on these more resilient end-markets, which management expects to drive future profitable growth.

The valuation utilizes a conservative growth model based on this strategic focus and management's guidance.

### A. Revenue Growth Assumptions (2026-2030)

Management guided for full-year fiscal 2026 Sales of \$1.835 billion to \$1.905 billion, representing organic growth of approximately 1% to 5% over the prior year. This low-to-mid single-digit growth aligns with a specialty ingredient company operating in a mixed demand environment.

The long-term growth assumption reflects an acceleration as the company's innovation platforms (injectables, high-value excipients) and cost optimization programs fully mature.

| Year | Basis / Rationale | Revenue Growth % | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Base)** | Actual Sales | - | \$1,824 |
| **FY2026** | Midpoint of management guidance (\$1.87B, 2.5% organic growth). | 2.5% | \$1,870 |
| **FY2027** | Slight acceleration as market headwinds ease and cost/optimization savings flow through. | 3.5% | \$1,936 |
| **FY2028** | Further acceleration toward long-term potential as Life Sciences continues to be the primary engine. | 4.5% | \$2,023 |
| **FY2029** | Stable, conservative growth rate for a mature specialty chemical company. | 4.5% | \$2,114 |
| **FY2030** | Stable, conservative growth rate. | 4.5% | \$2,209 |

### B. Net Income Margin Assumptions

For FY2026, management narrowed Adjusted EBITDA guidance to \$400-\$420 million. The underlying business is focused on high margins (Life Sciences EBITDA margin is over 30%). The company is targeting significant cost savings (\$30M restructuring and \$60M manufacturing optimization).

We use a projected Net Income Margin that starts conservatively and expands modestly, reflecting the completion of restructuring and realization of long-term benefits from a higher-margin product mix.

| Year | Rationale | Net Income Margin % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026** | Conservative net income on guided revenue; reflects continued D&A, interest, and taxes below the 22% FY2025 Adjusted EBITDA margin. | 6.0% |
| **FY2027** | Initial realization of cost savings and improved mix. | 6.5% |
| **FY2028** | Further margin expansion from 'globalize' initiatives. | 7.0% |
| **FY2029** | Approaching long-term, focused portfolio margin. | 7.5% |
| **FY2030** | Conservative long-term margin (Note: This is far below the Life Sciences margin of >30%, aligning with the "conservative" rule). | 8.0% |

### C. ROIC, Discount Rate, and Terminal Rate Assumptions

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Historical ROIC is 5.22%. We use a conservative $\text{ROIC}$ of **4.5%** for calculating additional income from reinvestment of prior year's cash (Net Income).
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** We use a conservative (higher) Discount Rate of **7.5%** to account for business cyclicality and the near-term operational challenges (e.g., Calvert City delay).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate ($g$):** A conservative long-term maturity rate for a specialty chemical company that is expected to grow slightly above the long-term GDP growth rate. We use **2.0%**.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The user-defined cash flow for the DCF model is calculated as:
$\text{Net Income (t) = Projected Net Income (t) + ROIC * Net Income (t-1)}$

For the first year (FY2026), $\text{Net Income (t-1)}$ will be set to $\text{Net Income (FY2025) of \$0}$ to eliminate the impact of the non-cash loss and apply the "if past ROIC is negative... just get a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC" rule to the first projected positive year.

| Year (t) | Projected Revenue | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) (4.5% * NI t-1) | Total Net Income (A+B) | Discount Factor (7.5%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$1,870 | 6.0% | \$112.2 | \$0.0 | \$112.2 | 0.930 | \$104.4 |
| **2027** | \$1,936 | 6.5% | \$125.8 | \$5.0 | \$130.8 | 0.865 | \$113.1 |
| **2028** | \$2,023 | 7.0% | \$141.6 | \$5.9 | \$147.5 | 0.805 | \$118.8 |
| **2029** | \$2,114 | 7.5% | \$158.5 | \$6.6 | \$165.1 | 0.749 | \$123.7 |
| **2030** | \$2,209 | 8.0% | \$176.7 | \$7.4 | \$184.1 | 0.697 | \$128.4 |
| | | | | | | **Sum of NPV (2026-2030)** | **\$588.4** |

### D. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is the value of the company's cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).

Formula: $\text{Terminal Value} = \text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2030}} * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)$

$\text{Terminal Value} = \$184.1 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.075 - 0.02) = \$184.1 * 1.02 / 0.055 = \$3,412.0$ million

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV):**

$\text{NPV TV} = \text{Terminal Value} * \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{2030}} = \$3,412.0 * 0.697 = \$2,379.7$ million

### E. Total Enterprise Value (EV)

$\text{Total Enterprise Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (2026-2030)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
$\text{Total Enterprise Value} = \$588.4 + \$2,379.7 = \$2,968.1$ million

| Less: Total Debt | \$1,387.0 |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **\$1,885.1** |
| Shares Outstanding | 46.0 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$40.98** |

## 5. Justification and Market Comparison

### Fair Value of Ashland Inc. (ASH) Stock

**Fair Value Per Share:** **\$40.98**

**Current Stock Price (Implied):** **\$60.65**

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$40.98** is approximately **32% lower** than the current implied market price of **\$60.65**. This significant difference suggests that the market is making more aggressive assumptions about Ashland's future profitability and growth than the conservative assumptions used in this DCF model.

| Model's Conservative Assumption | Market's Likely Assumption | Rationale for Market Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-Term Revenue Growth:** 4.5% | **Long-Term Revenue Growth:** $\sim6\%-8\%$ | The market may be projecting that Ashland's focus on high-growth areas like Life Sciences (Pharma/Injectables) will drive sustained, above-industry organic growth once global industrial demand (Specialty Additives) recovers. |
| **Long-Term Net Income Margin:** 8.0% | **Long-Term Net Income Margin:** $\sim10\%-12\%$ | The market is likely giving full credit to the significant, high-margin nature of the focused Life Sciences and Personal Care portfolios (which already have EBITDA margins >30%) and expects the multi-year cost optimization programs to drop a much higher percentage of revenue to the bottom line. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC):** 7.5% | **Discount Rate (WACC):** $\sim5.5\%-6.5\%$ | The market may be using a lower cost of capital, reflecting Ashland's strong balance sheet, solid liquidity (~$900M total liquidity), and manageable net leverage of 2.7x. A lower WACC significantly increases the value of the perpetual cash flows (Terminal Value). |

In conclusion, the market is pricing Ashland as a fully-transformed, high-growth, high-margin specialty ingredients pure-play, justifying a price of \$60.65. The conservative DCF model, strictly adhering to cautious growth and margin assumptions, produces a fair value of \$40.98, indicating the market is pricing in a successful execution of the long-term strategic plan with a quicker and more pronounced impact on the bottom line. The difference represents the premium for **successful execution risk** and the market's bullish long-term view on the specialized, high-barrier-to-entry Life Sciences segment.
