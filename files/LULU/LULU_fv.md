### **2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The business engine driving revenue is Lululemon's "Power of Three x2" growth strategy, which focuses on three pillars: **Product Innovation, Guest Experience, and Market Expansion**.

**Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **FY 2026 Target:** Management's stated goal is to achieve **\$12.5 billion** in net revenue by the end of **FY 2026** (Calendar Year 2027). This implies a significant jump from the FY 2024 base of $\text{\$10.6}$ billion.
    *   **FY 2025 Revenue:** To hit $\text{\$12.5}$ billion in 2026 from $\text{\$10.6}$ billion in 2024, the CAGR is approximately 8.5% over two years. The guidance for FY 2024 net revenue growth was 11-12% year-over-year. The implied FY 2025 revenue should be conservatively between the recent 2024 base and the 2026 goal. I will assume a strong ramp up.
        *   **2025 Projection:** $\text{\$10,600M} \times (1 + 10\%) = \text{\$11,660}$ million. (Slightly conservative given the 11-12% growth in 2024, factoring in some Americas softness).

2.  **Long-Term Growth (Post-2026):** The core driver, "quadrupling international revenue", will complete by 2026. After hitting the aggressive $\text{\$12.5}$ billion goal, growth is expected to moderate as the business matures and the law of large numbers takes effect.
    *   I will use a **conservative step-down approach** for the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) after the 2026 goal:
        *   **2027-2028:** Post-target adjustment, aggressive international growth continues to slow. **8.0% CAGR.**
        *   **2029-2030:** Growth normalizes toward a conservative long-term rate. **6.0% CAGR.**

| Fiscal Year (FYE Feb) | Base Revenue (Millions) | Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual Base)** | N/A | N/A | $\text{\$10,600}$ |
| **2025** | $\text{\$10,600}$ | $10.0\%$ | $\text{\$11,660}$ |
| **2026 (Management Target)** | $\text{\$11,660}$ | $7.2\%$ | $\text{\$12,500}$ |
| **2027** | $\text{\$12,500}$ | $8.0\%$ | $\text{\$13,500}$ |
| **2028** | $\text{\$13,500}$ | $8.0\%$ | $\text{\$14,580}$ |
| **2029** | $\text{\$14,580}$ | $6.0\%$ | $\text{\$15,455}$ |
| **2030** | $\text{\$15,455}$ | $6.0\%$ | $\text{\$16,382}$ |

### **3. Margin Projections & Net Income Calculation**

**Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **Operating Margin:** The management guided to a **modest operating margin expansion annually**. I will conservatively maintain the high **FY 2024 GAAP Operating Margin of $\text{23.7\%}$** across the projection period. This conservative choice hedges against potential future tariff impacts and increased SG&A spend as the company expands globally.
2.  **Effective Tax Rate:** I will use a conservative rate of $\text{30.0\%}$ (slightly higher than the FY 2024 rate of $\text{29.6\%}$) to maintain conservatism.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**

The rule states to use a reasonable ROIC based on the past to generate additional income. Lululemon has historically high ROIC, reflective of its capital-light model. To be conservative, I will use a **$\text{15\%}$ ROIC** applied to the previous year's Net Income (cash on hand), which is a high but reasonable return for a high-quality, capital-efficient business.

**Projected Net Income Calculation:**
*   **Income from Operations (EBIT)** = Projected Revenue * $\text{23.7\%}$
*   **Net Income (NI)** = EBIT * (1 - $\text{30.0\%}$)

| Fiscal Year (FYE Feb) | Projected Revenue (A) | Operating Margin | EBIT (B=A*23.7%) | Tax Rate | Net Income from Operations (C=B*70%) | ROIC Income (D=Prior NI * 15.0%) | Total Net Income (C+D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $\text{\$10,600}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$2,512}$ | $\text{29.6\%}$* | $\text{\$1,769}$ | N/A | $\text{\$1,769}$ |
| **2025** | $\text{\$11,660}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$2,760}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$1,932}$ | $\text{\$265}$ | $\text{\$2,197}$ |
| **2026** | $\text{\$12,500}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$2,963}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$2,074}$ | $\text{\$330}$ | $\text{\$2,404}$ |
| **2027** | $\text{\$13,500}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$3,199}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$2,239}$ | $\text{\$361}$ | $\text{\$2,600}$ |
| **2028** | $\text{\$14,580}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$3,456}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$2,419}$ | $\text{\$390}$ | $\text{\$2,809}$ |
| **2029** | $\text{\$15,455}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$3,663}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$2,564}$ | $\text{\$421}$ | $\text{\$2,985}$ |
| **2030** | $\text{\$16,382}$ | $23.7\%$ | $\text{\$3,883}$ | $30.0\%$ | $\text{\$2,718}$ | $\text{\$448}$ | $\text{\$3,166}$ |

*\*Note: $\text{29.6\%}$ used for historical 2024 calculation for accuracy.*

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

**DCF Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **$\text{10.0\%}$** - This is a conservative WACC/Discount Rate assumption, reflecting a high-quality brand with moderate financial risk but a relatively high equity risk premium.
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (Very Conservative Maturity Rate):** **$\text{2.0\%}$** - This is a very conservative rate, slightly below the typical long-term global GDP growth rate, assuming significant maturity and competition after 2030.
*   **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030 Net Income as Proxy for FCF):**
    $$TV = \frac{Total\ Net\ Income_{2030}\ \times\ (1 + Perpetual\ Growth\ Rate)}{Discount\ Rate - Perpetual\ Growth\ Rate}$$
    $$TV = \frac{\text{\$3,166M}\ \times\ (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \text{\$40,366.5}\ million$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (Discounting to the Present):**

| Year | Discount Period (t) | Total Net Income (Millions USD) (CFt) | Discount Factor ($\text{1}/(\text{1}+0.10)^t$) | NPV of Cash Flow (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 1 | $\text{\$2,197}$ | $\text{0.909}$ | $\text{\$1,997}$ |
| **2026** | 2 | $\text{\$2,404}$ | $\text{0.826}$ | $\text{\$1,986}$ |
| **2027** | 3 | $\text{\$2,600}$ | $\text{0.751}$ | $\text{\$1,953}$ |
| **2028** | 4 | $\text{\$2,809}$ | $\text{0.683}$ | $\text{\$1,919}$ |
| **2029** | 5 | $\text{\$2,985}$ | $\text{0.621}$ | $\text{\$1,854}$ |
| **2030** | 6 | $\text{\$3,166}$ | $\text{0.564}$ | $\text{\$1,786}$ |
| **Terminal Value** | 6 | $\text{\$40,366.5}$ | $\text{0.564}$ | $\text{\$22,766}$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | | **$\text{\$34,261}$** |

### **5. Fair Value Calculation**

**Fair Value of Equity (Millions USD):**

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $\text{\$34,261}$ |
| **Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $\text{\$1,984}$ |
| **Subtract: Total Interest-Bearing Debt** | $\text{\$0}$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$\text{\$36,245}$** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{Total\ Equity\ Value}{Diluted\ Shares\ Outstanding}$$
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{\$36,245\ million}}{\text{113.47\ million\ shares}} = \text{\$319.43}$$

### **6. Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **$\text{\$319.43}$** |
| **Current Stock Price** | *As of the time of this analysis (October 2025), I do not have the real-time stock price.* Let's use a proxy for the market price to complete the justification. Assuming a recent market price of **$\text{\$285.00}$** (based on LULU's range and underperformance in 2025 as suggested in one of the search results). |

**Justification: Why the Fair Value is Different from the Market Value**

My calculated Fair Value of **$\text{\$319.43}$** is **higher** than the assumed current market value of $\text{\$285.00}$ (a difference of $\text{+12.4\%}$).

**The Market's Assumptions (Implied by a Lower Price):**

The market is likely applying a **greater discount** to the company's future cash flows, implying:

1.  **Lower Long-Term Growth/Execution Risk:** The market may be skeptical of Lululemon's ability to execute its aggressive **Power of Three x2** goal (a $\text{\$12.5}$ billion revenue target by 2026) in the face of persistent **Americas softness** and increasing competition. The market is likely pricing in a lower post-2026 growth rate than my conservative $\text{6.0\%}$ to $\text{8.0\%}$ and/or a much higher discount rate to reflect that risk.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The market may be forecasting significant **margin contraction** due to intense promotional activity in North America and potential impacts from **tariffs**, as well as the high capital expenditure required for global expansion (new stores and distribution centers). While I conservatively used a high $\text{23.7\%}$ Operating Margin, the market likely anticipates a decline in the short-to-medium term.
3.  **Conservative ROIC:** The market is likely not giving full credit to the highly efficient $\text{15\%}$ ROIC applied to accumulated cash flows, anticipating that a larger portion of Net Income will be needed for maintenance Capital Expenditures (CapEx) to support the global store network.

**My Justification for the Higher Fair Value:**

The primary justification for my higher fair value rests on the conservative but reasonable adherence to management's own long-term strategy and a belief in the brand's premium pricing power.

1.  **Achievable Management Guidance:** I built the revenue projections directly from the management's publicly stated **\$12.5 billion by 2026** goal, which management has a history of achieving early. Assuming an 8% to 6% CAGR post-2026 is already conservative for a brand with a strong global runway (especially in China Mainland).
2.  **Pricing Power and Margin Resilience:** Lululemon's premium positioning and innovation-driven model have historically supported high gross and operating margins. My use of the *current* $\text{23.7\%}$ Operating Margin for the entire period, even with a $\text{30\%}$ tax rate and a $\text{10\%}$ discount rate, is a strong case for the brand's resilience and ability to keep costs in line with revenue growth.
3.  **High Capital Efficiency:** The $\text{15\%}$ ROIC is the most critical assumption. It implies that Lululemon's retained earnings will continue to be reinvested at high rates of return, a characteristic of a world-class, capital-light brand. The market is likely **underestimating the long-term compounding power** of this high reinvestment rate, which is why my DCF value is higher.
