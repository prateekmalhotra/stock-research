# Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) Valuation

## 1. Initial Financial Data & Key Assumptions

### Balance Sheet Figures
The figures are based on the most recent publicly available SEC filings, primarily the Q3 2025 (period ended November 2, 2025) results.

| Metric | Value (USD) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$176.42** | NASDAQ price as of the most recent data. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | **117.31 Million** | Includes common stock ($112.19$M) plus exchangeable shares ($5.12$M) as of December 5, 2025, which represents the fully diluted share count for valuation. |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **\$1.036 Billion** | Cash and cash equivalents as of Q3 2025 (Nov 2, 2025). |
| **Total Financial Debt** | **\$0 Billion** | Lululemon historically operates debt-free. Long-term debt is reported as \$0M as of October 2025. This excludes operating lease liabilities as they are operational rather than financial debt for this model. |

### Business Engine Analysis & Core Assumptions

The core business engine for Lululemon's future growth, as highlighted in the latest earnings calls, is shifting:

1.  **International Expansion:** This is the primary growth driver. Management guides for China Mainland growth at the high end of the 20%-25% range and International revenue growing 33% in Q3 2025.
2.  **U.S. Deceleration:** The domestic U.S. business is facing significant headwinds, with the Americas region seeing a 2% net revenue decrease and a 5% comparable sales decrease in Q3 2025. Management's full-year guidance expects the U.S. to be flat to slightly negative.
3.  **Channel and Category Growth:** Continued focus on the digital channel (42% of revenue) and expansion in Men's and Accessories.

| Metric | Base Value / Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Revenue (FY 2025)** | **\$11.005 Billion** | Midpoint of management's full-year 2025 guidance of \$10.962B to \$11.047B. |
| **Net Income Margin (FY 2025)** | **13.80%** | Implied from management's FY2025 diluted EPS guidance (\$12.97 midpoint) divided by the Revenue midpoint (\$11.005B) for the $117.31$M diluted share count. |
| **Conservative ROIC (Reinvestment Rate)** | **15.0%** | Historical TTM ROIC is very high (26-32%). A conservative long-term projection of **15.0%** is used to capture future income generated from the reinvestment of retained earnings, allowing for eventual mean reversion in capital efficiency. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative rate, slightly higher than a typical WACC for a stable, high-growth company in a mature market (typically 7-8%), reflecting current economic uncertainty and the stock's recent volatility. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **3.0%** | A very conservative, long-term rate, slightly above the long-run U.S. inflation/GDP growth rate, appropriate for a mature global apparel brand. |

## 2. Revenue and Net Income Projections (2025 - 2030)

The revenue growth model is built conservatively by assuming the decelerating U.S. trend continues for longer, while the rapid international growth also moderates over time as those markets mature.

### Revenue Model Justification

*   **2026-2027:** The U.S. business is still working through its "action plan" (management commentary) while International still delivers outsized results. Revenue growth is kept at a conservative **10.0%** for 2026 and **9.0%** for 2027, well below LULU's historical high growth but above the projected 5-6% (ex-53rd week) for 2025.
*   **2028-2030:** Growth continues to moderate, reflecting market saturation in core areas and a mature international segment. The growth rate is stepped down towards the long-term terminal growth rate.

### Net Income Margin Justification

*   **2025:** Uses the implied 13.80% margin from management's EPS/Revenue guidance, reflecting current pressures (tariff changes, markdowns).
*   **2026-2030:** Margin is projected to slightly recover and stabilize at a conservative **14.50%**. This assumes Lululemon successfully executes its new product/marketing strategies to improve the U.S. business and leverages higher operating margins from scaling international operations, reversing the guidance for an *operating margin decrease* in 2025.

### Projected Net Income Calculation

Net Income for the current year (N) is calculated as:
$$
\text{Net Income}_\text{N} = \left(\text{Revenue}_\text{N} \times \text{Net Income Margin}_\text{N}\right) + \left(\text{Cash}_\text{N-1} \times \text{ROIC}\right)
$$
*Where $\text{Cash}_\text{N-1}$ includes the prior year's Net Income, assuming all of it goes into cash.*

| Year (FY) | Revenue (B) | Growth % | Net Income Margin % | Prior Cash (B) | ROIC (15.0%) Income (B) | Total Net Income (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | \$11.005 | $5.5\%^*$ | 13.80% | N/A | N/A | \$1.520 |
| **2026** | \$12.106 | 10.0% | 14.50% | \$2.556 | \$0.383 | **\$2.130** |
| **2027** | \$13.195 | 9.0% | 14.50% | \$4.686 | \$0.703 | **\$2.620** |
| **2028** | \$14.251 | 8.0% | 14.50% | \$7.306 | \$1.096 | **\$3.161** |
| **2029** | \$15.259 | 7.0% | 14.50% | \$10.467 | \$1.570 | **\$3.788** |
| **2030** | \$16.175 | 6.0% | 14.50% | \$14.255 | \$2.138 | **\$4.473** |
| **Terminal Year** | \$16.650 | 3.0% | 14.50% | N/A | N/A | **\$2.414** |

$^*\text{FY2025 estimated growth is based on the 5-6\% constant-currency growth guidance (ex-53rd week), and a midpoint of 5.5\% is used here.}$
Prior Cash calculation: Cash 2025 = \$1.036B (Starting Cash) + \$1.520B (2025 Net Income) = \$2.556B.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### Present Value of Discrete Cash Flows (2026 - 2030)

| Year | Net Income (B) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026 | \$2.130 | 0.917 | \$1.954 |
| 2027 | \$2.620 | 0.842 | \$2.206 |
| 2028 | \$3.161 | 0.772 | \$2.441 |
| 2029 | \$3.788 | 0.708 | \$2.682 |
| 2030 | \$4.473 | 0.650 | \$2.906 |
| **Sum of Discrete Period PV** | | | **\$12.189** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model (GGM):
$$
\text{TV}_\text{2030} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_\text{2031}}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Terminal Growth Rate}}
$$
Where:
$$
\text{Net Income}_\text{2031} = \text{Net Income}_\text{2030} \times (1 + \text{Terminal Growth Rate})
$$
1.  **Terminal Year Net Income (2031):** $\$4.473 \text{B} \times (1 + 0.03) = \text{\$4.607 B}$
2.  **Terminal Value in 2030:** $\text{TV}_\text{2030} = \frac{\text{\$4.607 B}}{0.09 - 0.03} = \frac{\text{\$4.607 B}}{0.06} = \text{\$76.783 B}$

### Present Value of Terminal Value
$$
\text{PV of TV} = \text{TV}_\text{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_\text{2030}
$$
$$
\text{PV of TV} = \text{\$76.783 B} \times 0.650 = \text{\$49.989 B}
$$

### Total Net Present Value (NPV)

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \text{PV of Discrete Cash Flows} + \text{PV of Terminal Value}
$$
$$
\text{Total NPV} = \text{\$12.189 B} + \text{\$49.989 B} = \text{\$62.178 B}
$$

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value is derived from the Equity Value:
$$
\text{Equity Value} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

| Metric | Value (B) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV | \$62.178 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$1.036 |
| Subtract: Total Debt | \$0.000 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$63.214 Billion** |

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Total Shares Outstanding}}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{\$63.214 Billion}}{117.31 \text{ Million Shares}} = \text{\$538.86}
$$

## 5. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **\$538.86** |
| **Current Stock Price (Market Value)** | **\$176.42** |
| **Difference** | **+205.4%** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$538.86** is significantly higher (over 200%) than the current market price of **\$176.42**. This large disparity indicates that the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Lululemon's future profitability and/or longevity than the model, despite the model already using conservative inputs for ROIC, discount rate, and terminal growth.

**Why the Model's Assumptions Differ from the Market (The Case for Undervaluation):**

1.  **Conservative ROIC/Reinvestment:** The model uses a conservative 15.0% ROIC for new capital generation, even though the company's historical TTM ROIC has been near 30%. The market may be assuming the ROIC will collapse further as new store expansion requires more capital for diminishing returns.
2.  **Long-Term Growth in Net Income:** The DCF method front-loads the value of high-growth years and assumes a strong long-term margin. The market's price suggests it believes the **Net Income Margin** will:
    *   **Collapse significantly below the projected 14.50%** due to U.S. competitive pressure, higher tariffs, and sustained markdowns. The market is pricing in the *continuation* of the Q3 2025 gross and operating margin pressure, rather than the margin stabilization projected in the model.
    *   **Stop growing in the long-term,** leading to a much lower Terminal Value calculation. A \$176.42 price implies a much lower terminal growth rate (perhaps 0.5% or less) or a dramatically lower margin after 2030.
3.  **Risk/Discount Rate:** The market may be applying a much higher **Discount Rate** (effectively a higher WACC/risk premium) than the 9.0% used in the model. The CEO succession plan announcement and the challenges in the critical U.S. market increase perceived risk, driving the discount rate higher and punishing the stock price.

**Conclusion:**

The market is currently fixated on two major, near-term headwinds: the **Decelerating U.S. Business** and the **Margin Pressure** from high costs and markdowns (as seen in the 2025 guidance). The market price appears to reflect an expectation that Lululemon will be unable to overcome the U.S. competitive issues, and that its high-margin era is permanently over, leading to a long-term Net Income Margin significantly lower than the model's 14.50%.

The DCF model suggests that if Lululemon can stabilize its Net Income Margin near 14.50% and successfully execute its international expansion plan (leading to the projected revenue growth), the stock is deeply undervalued. The market's current assumption is that the international growth will *not* be enough to offset the persistent U.S. weakness and margin erosion.
