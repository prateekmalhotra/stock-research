## Business Summary

Rise Gold Corp. is a mineral exploration and development company that currently does not produce or sell gold. Its business model is centered on developing the historic Idaho-Maryland Gold Mine project located in California, USA. The core operation is raising capital from investors by selling stock to fund extensive geological testing, obtain complex environmental and operational permits, and prepare the site for future mining. Because the company is still in the development stage, its sole source of funding comes from these capital raises, primarily involving investors (both large institutions and individual retail investors). Should the project eventually enter production, its customers would be global metal refiners and bullion dealers who purchase raw gold.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the 'Permitting and Financing Risk.' Since the company operates in the strictly regulated environment of California, significant delays in obtaining necessary government approvals can halt development and continuously increase costs. Historically, permitting issues have caused many junior mining companies to fail or face years of setbacks. The associated financing risk means the company must continually raise large amounts of capital, often by issuing new shares, which dilutes the value of existing shares and harms current investors' positions. A key long-term risk is 'Commodity Price Volatility.' If the market price of gold drops significantly before or after the mine opens, the entire project could become uneconomical, regardless of how much gold is present. Furthermore, the estimates of the gold resource might be inaccurate, meaning the company could spend millions developing a mine that yields less gold than initially predicted, severely impacting future earnings.

### **History of Rise Gold Corp. (RYES)**

#### **The Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Early Years and Core Asset:** Rise Gold Corp. was originally incorporated in Nevada in 2007 as an exploration-stage company under the name Rise Resources Inc.
2.  **The Founding Goal:** The company's primary and ongoing goal is to successfully reopen the historic and high-grade Idaho-Maryland Gold Mine (I-M Mine) in Grass Valley, California.
3.  **Historical Significance:** The I-M Mine is a legendary piece of California's gold rush history, having been a major gold producer from the 1860s until 1957.
4.  **Why it Closed:** The mine was forced to shut down in 1942 during World War II, and when it attempted to reopen, a fixed, low price for gold made it unprofitable, leading to its final closure in 1957.

#### **Acquisition and Early Success (2017 - 2019)**

5.  **Acquiring the Asset:** In January 2017, the company (then Rise Resources Inc.) announced the purchase of the Idaho-Maryland Gold Mine, which includes surface land and extensive underground mineral rights.
6.  **The Name Change:** Shortly after, in April 2017, the company changed its name to Rise Gold Corp., signaling a clear, singular focus on the immense potential of the newly acquired gold project.
7.  **Tailwind: Exploration Success:** Before submitting a formal permit application, the company conducted extensive exploration drilling which confirmed numerous areas of high-grade gold, validating the decision to acquire the historic mine.
8.  **Goal for Reopening:** The company's plan is to recommence underground mining at a proposed rate of about 1,000 tons of gold-bearing rock per day, aiming for a modern, high-grade gold operation.

#### **Headwinds and the Permitting Battle (2019 - Present)**

9.  **The First Major Headwind (Permitting):** In November 2019, Rise Gold submitted a formal Use Permit application to Nevada County to allow the reopening of the mine.
10. **Innovative Solution (Environmental):** To address environmental concerns, the company submitted technical studies and worked with an independent consultant to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), concluding that the project would have less than significant environmental impacts with proper mitigation measures.
11. **Social Headwind and Community Work:** The project has faced opposition from some local groups and Indigenous communities, which the company has countered by engaging in community support, such as assisting with storm restoration and fire protection initiatives.
12. **The Major Legal Headwind:** Despite the environmental process and community support, the Nevada County Board of Supervisors rejected the company's application for a "vested right" to mine in December 2023.
13. **The Current Legal Solution:** Rise Gold is challenging the County's decision through a lawsuit, arguing that a vested right to a pre-existing use (mining since the 1860s) does not automatically expire just because the operation ceased years ago.

#### **Present Day and The Path Forward**

14. **Ongoing Challenge: Financing and Legal Fees:** As an exploration company, Rise Gold has incurred losses since inception and must continually raise significant capital to fund its legal expenses and technical work, with a large financing closed in late 2025.
15. **Major Current Tailwinds:** The company's legal position is strengthened by a state court ruling that supports their argument against the abandonment of a vested mining right by cessation of use.
16. **The Backup Plan (Fifth Amendment):** If the court rules against the company and denies them the right to mine, management plans to pursue a federal lawsuit for "just compensation," valuing their mineral estate at a significant amount.
17. **New Diversification Tailwind:** In late 2025, the company began reviewing historical data which suggests its mine also holds significant amounts of **tungsten**, a valuable metal on the U.S. Critical Metals List, potentially adding a second key asset to the project.
18. **The Ultimate Goal:** Rise Gold Corp. remains focused on its single, clear mission: to overcome the regulatory and legal hurdles and unlock the estimated $400 million value of the historic, high-grade Idaho-Maryland Mine by bringing it back into production in a modern, environmentally responsible manner.

## Moat Analysis

The moat analysis for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES) is fundamentally different from a typical operating company, as it is an exploration-stage miner with one principal, undeveloped asset. Its moat is rooted in the **scarcity and potential quality of its physical asset** rather than business operations or customer relationships.

### Analysis of the Moat of Rise Gold Corp. (RYES)

1.  **Unique and Scarce Physical Asset (The Foundation of the Moat):** The company's primary asset is the historic Idaho-Maryland Gold Mine, which once ranked as the second-largest gold producer in the United States by annual production. This mine has a known history of producing over $2.4$ million ounces of gold, which is a rare and difficult-to-replicate physical resource.

2.  **Potential for Strong Cost Advantage (Differentiation from Competitors):** The mine's historic average mill head grade of $17$ grams per tonne ($\text{gpt}$) and a drill sample grade of $8.5 \text{ gpt}$ are significantly higher than the 2021 world average head grade of $1.35 \text{ gpt}$. This high-grade resource would translate directly into a **lower production cost** (All-in Sustaining Cost or AISC) per ounce of gold, giving the company a massive competitive advantage over most global gold miners, which is the key form of "moat" in the mining industry.

3.  **Special Position with a Potential Secondary Commodity:** Historical data indicates that the mine also contains significant amounts of **tungsten**, a metal listed as a U.S. critical metal by the Department of Energy, and was mined for this purpose after gold production ceased in the 1950s. This secondary critical-metal resource adds potential diversification and value that few single-asset gold competitors possess.

4.  **No Pricing Power on Product, but High-Grade Resilience:** As a gold and tungsten producer, the company sells commodities and is a **price-taker** in the global market, meaning it has no special pricing power. However, the high-grade nature of the deposit provides a resilient **margin advantage**, acting as a buffer against gold price downturns, which is a crucial form of differentiation.

5.  **Customer and Contracts are One-Time Commodity Sales:** The customers are not "sticky" or recurring in the service/subscription sense; the business model involves one-time sales of a refined commodity (gold and tungsten concentrates) at market prices to a universal buyer.

6.  **The Reason for Growth into Current State (Asset Acquisition):** The company grew by acquiring this historic, high-quality, past-producing asset in a politically stable but environmentally sensitive jurisdiction (California). Its current size and valuation are based on the inherent, un-mined value of that specific mineral asset and the progress made in the necessary legal and technical studies to re-open it.

### Risk of Displacement and Moat Preservation

7.  **High Risk of Displacement by Regulatory/Legal Challenges:** The primary risk is not a competitor with more capital, but the **regulatory environment**. The company is an exploration-stage business and is currently engaged in a major legal battle to assert its vested mining rights after Nevada County denied its permit application. If the company loses this legal challenge, its entire project and potential moat could be eliminated, making it easily displaced by *regulatory denial*.

8.  **Moat Preservation Efforts (Beyond Litigation):** Beyond the critical litigation, the company is attempting to build a moat through modern, environmentally conscious design. The plan includes a "state-of-the-art" facility and metallurgical test work demonstrating that the ore can be processed with an environmentally friendly scheme at a coarse grind size. This coarser grind size offers benefits like improved tailings stability, less dust, and reduced power consumption, which is a unique operational and environmental advantage in California.

9.  **No Need for Traditional R&D or Constant Innovation:** The company is focused on the geological and development phase, not product innovation. Its capital and resources are directed toward **legal fees, technical reports, and exploration work**. The "innovation" is limited to applying efficient, modern, and environmentally sound mining engineering to exploit a historical, high-grade deposit.

---

## Catalyst Analysis

The primary catalyst for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES) is the successful permitting and reopening of its Idaho-Maryland Gold Mine. As an exploration-stage company engaged in litigation, key price movements will be tied to legal and exploration milestones.

## Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Positive Outcome of Vested Rights Litigation:** A court verdict is expected in the first quarter of 2026 for the company's lawsuit (Writ of Mandamus) against Nevada County, which aims to compel the county to recognize its "constitutionally-protected vested right to mine" without a use permit. A positive decision would be the single most significant event to de-risk the project and could immediately unlock the mine's value.

2.  **Tungsten Exploration Results and Strategy:** The company is currently reviewing historical data for significant tungsten deposits, a metal on the U.S. Critical Metals List. The release of encouraging historical data or the announcement of a planned work program (like re-assaying drill cores) could attract investment interest, especially as tungsten is critical for defense applications and U.S. domestic supply has been absent since 2015.

3.  **New CEO's Strategic Direction:** The recent appointment of David Watkinson as President and CEO, a mining engineer with 40 years of experience and direct knowledge of the Idaho-Maryland Mine, is a key strategic move. His experience and local community standing could help navigate the political and technical challenges.

## Long-Term Catalysts (1-5 Years)

1.  **Mine Development and Construction Decision:** After securing the necessary permits or a favorable legal ruling, a decision to proceed with mine development would be the next major catalyst. The company envisions recommencing underground mining at a rate of 1,000 tons per day.

2.  **Confirmation of Tungsten Reserve and Federal Support:** If the review confirms a significant tungsten resource, the company may gain access to potential federal sponsorship or funding, which could substantially de-risk the project's financing. The mine has a history of tungsten production with U.S. Department of Defense support.

3.  **Gold Production and Revenue Generation:** The ultimate long-term catalyst is the Idaho-Maryland Mine commencing production, which is historically a high-grade gold mine that produced an estimated 2.4 million ounces of gold. Achieving production would transition the company from an exploration-stage asset into a cash-flow generating mining company.

## Management's Strategy and Statements

**Management's Core Strategy (Explicitly stated in releases, as traditional earnings calls are not summarized):**

*   **Aggressive Legal Defense of Property Rights:** Management's primary strategy is to aggressively pursue its vested right to mine without a use permit through litigation, specifically filing a Writ of Mandamus to "compel the Board of Supervisors... to follow applicable law."
*   **Dual-Metal Focus (Gold and Critical Metals):** Former CEO Joseph Mullin stated the new focus on tungsten, a critical mineral, makes the I-M Mine an "ideal project for federal sponsorship" as the U.S. aims to reshore its critical defense industries.
*   **Monetization of Non-Core Assets for Capital:** The company executed a land sale to raise capital and pay off secured debt, which management noted leaves the company with a "full treasury" to support operations and legal claims.
*   **Valuation Based on Historical Production/Takings:** Management believes the fair market value of the mineral estate is "at least $400 million" if the County's actions were to be considered a "taking" of the property under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
*   **Confidence in New Leadership:** Daniel Oliver, the Chairman of the Board, commented that the new CEO, Mr. Watkinson, "brings decades of technical knowledge about the I-M Mine" and that the board is "confident that Watkinson's leadership will help unlock the value of the I-M Mine."

## Management Record

The management of Rise Gold Corp. (RYES) has recently undergone a major change, with the company's strategy heavily focused on litigation to unlock its key asset's value.

### **I. Management Transition and Background**

1.  **CEO Change:** The company recently appointed David Watkinson as President and CEO on November 20, 2025, replacing Joe Mullin, who resigned to pursue a new opportunity with no reported disagreements with the company.
2.  **Former CEO (Joe Mullin):** Joe Mullin was appointed in September 2023 and focused on corporate actions like raising capital, managing litigation, and commencing a review of the mine's tungsten targets before his resignation after a short tenure.
3.  **New CEO's Extensive Experience:** David Watkinson brings 40 years of professional engineering experience in mine development, including senior roles at major companies like Placer Dome Inc. and Kinross Gold Corporation.
4.  **Key Asset Expertise:** Crucially, Watkinson previously served as CEO of Emgold Mining Corporation, which controlled the Idaho-Maryland Mine for approximately 25 years before Rise Gold acquired it, giving him decades of technical knowledge and local community ties.

### **II. Track Record, Key Decisions, and Shareholder Value**

1.  **Historical Track Record (Watkinson):** As CEO of Emgold, Watkinson followed a strategy of acquiring, adding value through exploration, and monetizing assets, successfully completing a profitable sale of the Troilus North property for cash and shares.
2.  **Financial Performance and Dilution:** As an exploration-stage company, RYES is pre-revenue and unprofitable; shareholders experienced substantial dilution in the past year, with total shares outstanding growing by 115.8%.
3.  **Key Decisions to Fund Operations:** The management team, under the previous CEO, has focused on raising capital for operations and litigation, including a US$7,000,000 financing in October 2025 and selling non-core surface land to repay debt.
4.  **Insider Sentiment:** Insiders have shown positive sentiment, with insider buying exceeding selling in the three months prior to the recent management change.

### **III. Future Strategy and Vision**

1.  **Immediate Strategy: Litigation Focus:** The core strategy is centered on winning the ongoing legal dispute (writ of mandamus) against Nevada County to recognize the mine's vested right to operate, with a verdict expected in the first quarter of 2026.
2.  **Long-Term Vision:** The company's long-term goal, contingent on a favorable legal decision, is to transition to an operating mine with plans to employ approximately 300 people and construct a second service shaft and a water treatment plant.
3.  **New Resource Exploration:** Management recently initiated a review of historical data suggesting the Idaho-Maryland mine may also contain significant amounts of tungsten, a U.S. Department of Energy-listed critical metal, providing a potential secondary strategic focus.
4.  **Value Proposition:** Despite being currently unprofitable, management internally believes the fair market value of the Idaho-Maryland mineral estate is at least $400 million based on comparable mines and historic yields.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available public filings and disclosures, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES):

**Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is reported to be approximately 29.95%, which is a high percentage and generally indicates a strong alignment between management/directors and shareholder interests. Higher ownership means their personal wealth is directly tied to the company's stock price performance.

2.  **Director's Active Buying:** A significant director and 10% owner, Daniel Oliver Jr., has consistently purchased shares in the open market in substantial amounts, further demonstrating a strong vote of confidence and a direct alignment with other shareholders.

3.  **Equity-Heavy Compensation Structure:** A large component of the executive and director compensation is paid in equity, specifically stock options and Deferred Share Units (DSUs), which encourages value creation over the long term, as these instruments increase in value only if the share price rises. For instance, a former CEO's compensation was 79.4% comprised of bonuses, stock, and options.

4.  **Immediate Vesting of Stock Options:** In recent compensation grants for the new CEO and other directors/officers, a significant number of stock options were granted as **fully vested** immediately. This practice is a point of concern as it provides an instant benefit regardless of future performance, weakening the pure long-term incentive alignment of the grant.

5.  **Deferred Share Units (DSUs) for Long-Term Hold:** Directors and officers have also been granted DSUs, which are designed to convert into common shares only upon the cessation of their eligible person status (e.g., retirement). This structure encourages a long-term commitment to the company's success and share value.

6.  **Base Compensation vs. Performance:** The base cash compensation for the new CEO is set at approximately $132,000 annually, which is modest for a CEO, making the equity portion a significant driver of their total potential wealth. However, the former CEO's compensation was noted to have increased despite the company being unprofitable, suggesting a potential misalignment between pay and financial performance metrics in the past.

**Conclusion on Incentives**

Management and directors for Rise Gold Corp. generally appear to be incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, driven by the:

*   **Strong Alignment:** The very high collective insider ownership (~30%) and consistent open-market buying by a key director/owner provide a powerful incentive for management to act in the interest of shareholders.
*   **Performance-Link:** The heavy reliance on stock options and DSUs means a large portion of their potential compensation is directly tied to the company's stock price appreciation over a multi-year horizon.

A minor concern is the issuance of immediately fully vested options, as this suggests some short-term incentives are present and reduces the emphasis on sustained, future performance. Overall, the substantial equity ownership and equity-heavy pay structure suggest that management's financial success is largely dependent on the creation of shareholder value.

## Price History

Based on a review of recent price history and technical indicators, here is an analysis of Rise Gold Corp. (RYES):

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The last reported price for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES) is approximately **\$0.162**. This price falls within its 52-week trading range of a low of **\$0.0391** and a high of up to **\$0.3200**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The current stock price of \$0.162 is approximately **314%** above its 52-week low of \$0.0391, indicating a significant climb from its annual trough.

3.  **Technical Analysis - Trading Low?:** Technical analysis indicators suggest a mixed, but generally weaker, short-term outlook. The stock is currently trading *below* its 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day exponential moving averages, which generally signals a **Sell** or short-term trading low. However, it remains *above* its 200-day simple moving average and has some buy signals from indicators like MACD and CCI, suggesting some longer-term support.

4.  **Big Gains in the Last Year:** Over the past year, the stock has seen a major rally, showing an increase of approximately **96.48%**, and a gain of over 76% in the last six months alone.

5.  **Explanation for Recent Gains:** The large increase is likely tied to the company's activities related to the Idaho-Maryland Mine, including closing a US\$7,000,000 financing in October 2025, and continued legal efforts to unlock the mine's value. The company also cleared secured debt using proceeds from a total of $4.3 million in industrial land sales.

6.  **Recent Significant Drop:** Despite the large annual gain, the stock has experienced a recent downturn, falling by over **44%** since a pivot top that occurred in late September 2025. This short-term weakness contributes to the current mixed technical signal.

---

## Long Thesis

Rise Gold's valuation will increase significantly because it is on the cusp of successfully overcoming the regulatory and legal hurdles needed to reopen a historic, high-grade gold mine in California. In the near term, a critical court decision expected in early 2026 is likely to rule in the company's favor, validating its constitutional right to mine and immediately de-risking the project. Furthermore, new management is exploring substantial deposits of tungsten, a U.S. 'critical metal,' which could attract federal funding and provide a valuable secondary revenue source. In the long term, if opened, the Idaho-Maryland Mine is expected to be one of the lowest-cost gold producers globally due to its exceptionally high gold grade, leading to massive profit margins and unlocking the estimated $400 million value of the mineral deposit as the company transitions from a legal entity into a cash-flow-generating mining operation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case is entirely dependent on four main assumptions: 1) Rise Gold must win the current lawsuit against Nevada County to legally confirm its vested right to operate the mine. 2) The high-grade gold and potential tungsten deposits must be as large and accessible as historical data and current exploration suggest. 3) The company must successfully secure the substantial financing required for mine construction and development after the permits are secured. 4) The global market prices for gold and tungsten must remain high enough to ensure the project is profitable upon commencing production.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several critical holes, unverified assumptions, and high-stakes risks in the long thesis for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES).

### **Critique: Holes and Faults in the Long Thesis**

1.  **Binary and Protracted Legal Risk is Understated:** The bull case presents the January 2026 court decision as a likely win that will *immediately de-risk* the project. In reality, the legal situation is a highly adversarial, binary gamble: the Nevada County Board of Supervisors unanimously rejected both the vested rights petition and the conditional use permit, and the County has publicly stated it does not believe the lawsuit has merit. A loss means an indefinite halt to development, while a win would likely be followed by immediate and protracted environmental and community appeals. [cite: 3, 5, 19, 22 (from previous search)]
2.  **Lack of Economic Viability and Reserve Certainty:** The thesis hinges on the mine being an exceptionally high-grade deposit, but the resource claims are based on **historical data** (pre-1957) and not a modern, independent, compliant (e.g., NI 43-101) Feasibility Study to establish *Mineral Reserves*. The company itself cautions investors that it "has not completed a feasibility study to establish mineral reserves and therefore has not demonstrated economic viability." [cite: 23 (from previous search), 3 (from previous search)]
3.  **"Lowest-Cost Producer" Claim is Unverified and Highly Questionable:** There is no publicly available **All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC)** figure to support the claim of being "one of the lowest-cost gold producers globally." Operating a mine in a high-cost, litigious jurisdiction like California requires expensive environmental mitigation (water treatment, noise/vibration dampening) and compliance, which will materially increase operating costs far beyond a simple calculation based on high-grade alone. Furthermore, the product is a gold concentrate, which requires costly off-site processing, further reducing profitability. [cite: 7, 22 (from previous search)]
4.  **Major Capital Expenditure Gap:** The company, which is currently an exploration-stage entity with zero revenue and persistent losses, is funding its legal and technical work through small private placements (e.g., US$7M). The actual CapEx to dewater a deep, historical mine and construct the necessary modern infrastructure (estimated by some to be in the $100M - $200M range) is not secured and represents a massive, dilutive financing hurdle that is downplayed by the thesis. [cite: 4, 7 (from previous search), 20 (from previous search)]
5.  **Tungsten Opportunity is Speculative:** The "valuable secondary revenue source" from tungsten is currently based on a **review of historical data** and exploration targets, not a verified or defined modern Mineral Resource Estimate. Attracting substantial federal funding is a speculative outcome based on the commodity's "critical metal" status, not a guarantee for a site with major political and permitting opposition. [cite: 11 (from previous search), 15 (from previous search), 16 (from previous search)]
6.  **$400 Million Valuation is a Legal Weapon, Not an Asset Value:** The estimated $400 million value of the mineral deposit is a self-declared, conservative figure intended for a potential "takings action" federal lawsuit, which would only be pursued *if* the company loses the current vested rights case. It is an estimated compensation amount, not a validated valuation of the in-situ, permitted mineral assets ready for extraction. [cite: 3 (from previous search), 4 (from previous search)]

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Rise Gold Corp. (RYES)**

1.  **Regulatory Paralysis and Binary Litigation:** Rise Gold is fundamentally a legal entity, not a mining operation, whose value is based on the highly unpredictable outcome of a single court case in early 2026; a loss would validate the unanimous local political denial of all permits and indefinitely delay or end the mine's restart.
2.  **Existential Financial Risk from Unfunded CapEx:** The company faces severe financial challenges and has not secured the hundreds of millions in capital required for construction; a significant financing must follow a legal win, which will likely be highly dilutive to existing shareholders and dependent on successfully permitting the dewatering of the mine and mitigating environmental opposition.
3.  **Unverified Economics in a High-Cost Environment:** The core of the investment case relies on historic high-grade gold, which is offset by the unquantified, but highly probable, material costs of modern environmental compliance, water treatment, labor, and energy in California, making the claim of being a "lowest-cost producer" highly speculative.
4.  **Resource Uncertainty and Timeline Risk:** The gold reserve and tungsten deposit potential lack a modern, independent feasibility study, meaning the economic and geological assumptions are speculative, and the path from a hypothetical legal win to first gold production is a multi-year, complex process fraught with further appeals and community resistance.

## Next Steps

This is a great, detailed analysis. You have correctly identified that the key fault in the bull case is the lack of a modern, compliant economic study (NI 43-101/PEA/FS) and the highly binary legal/permitting risk.

The search results confirm that the main legal argument is over the **vested right** to mine and the County's rejection of that based on a claim of "abandonment." Your next steps should focus on quantifying the financial and technical gaps.

Here are the most important questions and next steps for investigation:

### **Critical Unanswered Questions and Next Steps**

1.  **Find the Full Financial Model (CapEx, OpEx, AISC):**
    *   **Question:** What is the most recent **estimated All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC)** per ounce of gold? The claim of being a "lowest-cost producer" is purely speculative without this figure.
    *   **Question:** What is the management's **estimated CapEx** (Capital Expenditure) to fully construct the mine (dewatering, shaft, mill, water treatment plant)? The wide $\$100M - \$200M$ range needs to be narrowed down with a management-cited number.
    *   **Action:** Search for the 2017 NI 43-101 Technical Report on the company's website (confirmed in search results) and look for the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) within it, specifically seeking out the CapEx, OpEx, and AISC estimates. **(The initial search only confirmed the report exists, not the content)**

2.  **Verify the Tungsten Opportunity's Economics:**
    *   **Question:** What is the market price/value of the high-grade Tungsten (WO\$_3\$) concentrate (70%+ WO\$_3\$) historically produced?
    *   **Question:** What is the **estimated revenue or value contribution** of the tungsten resource compared to the gold resource, and is there any new information on the potential for federal funding (grants or loan guarantees)?
    *   **Action:** Search for recent tungsten concentrate prices and the current status of any U.S. government critical mineral funding programs that Rise Gold might qualify for.

3.  **Analyze Current Financials and Litigation Cost (Cash Burn):**
    *   **Question:** What is the company's current quarterly **cash burn rate** (cash used in operating activities)? The $\$7M$ raise must cover operational *and* expensive litigation costs.
    *   **Question:** What is the **estimated cost of the current litigation** through to the January 2026 verdict, and what are the projected costs if the County appeals? This will determine how much more dilution is likely.
    *   **Action:** Look for the most recent Quarterly/Annual Filings (MD&A or 10-Q/K) to find the "cash used in operating activities" and "cash on hand" to calculate the runway.

4.  **Detail the Legal Challenge's Specifics:**
    *   **Question:** What is the County's **specific, detailed legal argument for *abandonment*** of the vested right? You know the *theme* (cessation of use) but need the *specific overt acts or failure to act* the County claims.
    *   **Question:** What is the likely **duration and cost of the appeals process**? If Rise Gold wins in Superior Court (January 2026), the County is highly likely to appeal, meaning first gold production is still years away.
    *   **Action:** Search for the County's legal brief or statements regarding the lawsuit to understand their arguments for why the right to mine was abandoned since 1957.
