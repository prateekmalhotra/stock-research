### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (FYE 2026 - FYE 2030)

Nippon Sanso Holdings is primarily an industrial gas company with a significant and growing presence in the **Electronics** (semiconductor) and **Carbon Neutrality** (hydrogen/environmental) sectors, which are the core business drivers and growth engines. The company operates globally across five segments: Japan, the US, Europe, Asia & Oceania (Gas), and Thermos [cite: 7 in previous step, 7].

#### **A. Business Engine & Growth Assumptions**

1.  **FYE 2026 (Final year of NS Vision 2026):**
    *   The original NS Vision 2026 targets (set in 2022) for Revenue ($¥975B–¥1,000B$) and Core Operating Profit ($¥125B–¥135B$) have been *significantly exceeded* by the FYE 2025 actual results ($¥1,308B$ Revenue and $¥189.1B$ COI) [cite: 9 in previous step, 7]. This outperformance is largely due to effective price management and the tailwind from the weak Japanese yen [cite: 1, 4 in previous step].
    *   **Conservative Assumption for FY2026:** Given the outperformance and the cyclical nature of industrial gas demand (especially in electronics, which has seen some softening), a **conservative** approach is to assume a modest real growth in the core business, but temper the overall growth due to potential foreign exchange rate normalization (JPY appreciation) and market uncertainties mentioned by management [cite: 9 in previous step]. I will project **2.0%** growth, which is close to the average organic revenue growth seen in some quarters (e.g., Q2 FY2025 ex-currency was 2% [cite: 3 in previous step]).

2.  **FYE 2027 - FYE 2030 (New 2030 Vision):**
    *   The company is launching a new medium-term management plan starting April 1, 2026 (FYE 2027), aimed at realizing a **Vision for 2030**.
    *   The focus is on two high-growth themes: **"Total Electronics"** (semiconductor ecosystem) and **"Carbon Neutrality"** (environmental and hydrogen sectors) [cite: 10 in previous step, 12 in previous step]. Nippon Sanso is making *Strategic investments* in carbon-neutral projects [cite: 12 in previous step]. The semiconductor market is expected to drive demand for electronic material gases, and hydrogen/carbon capture projects are secular growth trends for industrial gas companies.
    *   **Conservative Assumption for FY2027-2030:** I will use a conservative growth rate that acknowledges the company's exposure to the steady industrial gas market (typically 2-4% growth) and the high-growth electronics/clean energy segments (which can see higher growth, but are also cyclical). I will assume a compounded annual growth rate of **3.5%** for the period FY2027 to FY2030.

#### **B. Margin Projections**

*   **FYE 2025 Actual Net Income Margin:** $98,779 / 1,308,024 \approx 7.55\%$ [cite: 7 in previous step].
*   **FYE 2025 Actual Core Operating Income Margin:** $189,149 / 1,308,024 \approx 14.46\%$ [cite: 7 in previous step].
*   Management emphasized continued effective **price management** and **productivity initiatives** to improve profitability [cite: 1, 2 in previous step].
*   **Conservative Assumption for Net Income Margin:** I will assume a stable **7.55%** Net Income Margin (based on the actual FYE 2025 result) for all projection years (FY2026-FY2030). This is conservative as it assumes no margin expansion from the "Operational Excellence" initiatives mentioned in the management plan [cite: 12 in previous step].

#### **C. Revenue and Net Income Projections**

| Fiscal Year (Ends Mar 31) | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth Rate** | 4.2% [cite: 7 in previous step] | 2.00% | 3.50% | 3.50% | 3.50% | 3.50% |
| **Revenue** (¥ million) | 1,308,024 | 1,334,184 | 1,380,870 | 1,429,206 | 1,479,188 | 1,531,069 |

### 3. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Cash Flow

The instruction requires a cash-flow model where net income for the previous year accumulates as cash, and a return (ROIC) on that cash generates additional income for the next year.

**A. Historical ROIC Calculation**

*   **Total Invested Capital (FYE 2025):** Total Debt + Total Equity = $¥850,570 + ¥1,020,930 = ¥1,871,500$ million.
*   **After-Tax Operating Income (NOPAT):** Core Operating Income (COI) $\times$ (1 - Tax Rate).
    *   **Effective Tax Rate (FYE 2025):** (Income before income taxes $\times$ Tax Rate) $\approx$ (Taxes Paid / Income before taxes). Since explicit tax rate is not available, I will use a reasonable Japanese corporate tax rate including local taxes, which is conservatively **30.0%**.
    *   **NOPAT:** $¥189,149 \times (1 - 0.30) = ¥132,404$ million.
*   **ROIC (FYE 2025):** NOPAT / Total Invested Capital $= ¥132,404 / ¥1,871,500 \approx **7.07\%$**.

**B. Projected Net Income with ROIC Addition**

I will use a conservative ROIC of **6.0%** for the projected years, which is below the calculated historical ROIC of $7.07\%$.

| Fiscal Year | Initial Net Income (¥ million) | Accumulated Cash from Previous Year (¥ million) | ROIC Income (6.0%) (¥ million) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (¥ million) | Accumulated Cash for Next Year (¥ million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FY2025 (Actual) | 98,779 | — | — | 98,779 | 98,779 |
| **FY2026** | 100,774 | 98,779 | 5,927 | **106,701** | 205,480 |
| **FY2027** | 104,456 | 205,480 | 12,329 | **116,785** | 322,265 |
| **FY2028** | 108,295 | 322,265 | 19,336 | **127,631** | 449,896 |
| **FY2029** | 112,305 | 449,896 | 26,994 | **139,299** | 589,195 |
| **FY2030** | 116,498 | 589,195 | 35,352 | **151,850** | 741,045 |

*Note: The Net Income from that year is added to the previous year's accumulated cash to determine the next year's accumulated cash.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### **A. Discount Rate (WACC Proxy)**

*   **Conservative but Reasonable Discount Rate:** Given the company's stable industrial gas business, global presence, and focus on high-growth but long-term (non-speculative) sectors (Semiconductors, Hydrogen), I will use a conservative Discount Rate (proxy for WACC) of **8.0%**. This is higher than the historical ROIC, adding a conservative bias.

#### **B. Terminal Value (TV)**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** The global industrial gas industry is a mature, infrastructure-heavy sector. I will use a very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%**, which is below the long-term inflation goal of most developed economies and the projected 3.5% medium-term growth.
*   **Terminal Value Calculation (at end of FY2030):**
    $$TV = \frac{CashFlow_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
    $$TV = \frac{¥151,850 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.08 - 0.02} = \frac{¥154,887}{0.06} = ¥2,581,450 \text{ million}$$

#### **C. Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows**

| Fiscal Year | Cash Flow (¥ million) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value (¥ million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026** | 106,701 | $1 / (1.08)^1$ = 0.9259 | 98,797 |
| **FY2027** | 116,785 | $1 / (1.08)^2$ = 0.8573 | 100,147 |
| **FY2028** | 127,631 | $1 / (1.08)^3$ = 0.7938 | 101,304 |
| **FY2029** | 139,299 | $1 / (1.08)^4$ = 0.7350 | 102,339 |
| **FY2030 (Operating CF)** | 151,850 | $1 / (1.08)^5$ = 0.6806 | 103,340 |
| **FY2030 (Terminal Value)** | 2,581,450 | $1 / (1.08)^5$ = 0.6806 | 1,756,926 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **¥2,262,853** |

---

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

1.  **Enterprise Value (EV):** Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Cash & Cash Equivalents
    $$EV = ¥2,262,853 + ¥144,528 = ¥2,407,381 \text{ million}$$

2.  **Equity Value:** Enterprise Value - Total Debt
    $$Equity Value = ¥2,407,381 - ¥850,570 = ¥1,556,811 \text{ million}$$

3.  **Fair Value Per Share (JPY):** Equity Value / Total Issued Shares
    $$\text{Fair Value (JPY)} = \frac{¥1,556,811,000,000}{433,092,837 \text{ shares}} = ¥3,594.69 \text{ per share}$$

4.  **Fair Value Per Share (USD):** Fair Value (JPY) $\times$ Exchange Rate
    $$\text{Fair Value (USD)} = ¥3,594.69 \times 0.00649 \approx **\$23.33 \text{ per share}**$$

### 6. Fair Value Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (USD)** | **\$23.33** |
| **Current Stock Price (TYNPF)** | **\$34.31** |

#### **Justification of Discrepancy (Market's Assumptions)**

My calculated Fair Value of **\$23.33** is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$34.31**. This suggests the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future growth and profitability.

The key differences between my conservative DCF model and the market's implied assumptions are likely in the following areas:

1.  **Growth Rate (The Business Engine):** My model uses a conservative 2.0% growth in FY2026 and a stable 3.5% through FY2030, based on historical organic growth and the conservative interpretation of the new 2030 Vision. The market is likely pricing in a higher growth trajectory, especially in the high-margin **Electronics** (semiconductor) and **Hydrogen/Carbon Neutrality** sectors, which are major long-term capital expenditure cycles globally. The market might be assuming **5.0% - 6.0%** annual revenue growth, aligning the company more closely with high-growth specialty gas peers rather than the traditional industrial gas sector.
2.  **Profitability and Margin Expansion:** My model uses a stable Net Income Margin of 7.55%. The market may be assuming the company's "effective price management and productivity initiatives" [cite: 1 in previous step] and the shift towards higher-value Electronic and Clean Energy gases will lead to **significant margin expansion** (e.g., Net Income Margin rising to $8.5\%-9.5\%$) by 2030.
3.  **Discount Rate:** My conservative discount rate of 8.0% is a conservative hurdle. The market, reflecting the company's low-volatility and stable recurring revenue from "pipe-line" gas supply contracts, might be using a lower WACC (closer to **6.0%-7.0%**), which drastically increases the Net Present Value of future cash flows.

**Conclusion:** The large premium of the market price (\$34.31) over my conservative fair value (\$23.33) is a result of the market **aggressively pricing in the success of the new 2030 Vision**, specifically predicting: **higher long-term revenue growth** driven by the semiconductor boom and clean energy transition, **significant margin expansion** from operational excellence, and a **lower risk profile** (lower WACC) due to its essential, infrastructure-like industrial gas business model. My valuation is conservative and represents a "worst-case stable growth" scenario, while the market is buying into the *future growth story* promised by the new long-term management plan.
