## Business Summary

B. Riley Financial operates as a diversified financial services company primarily serving mid-sized businesses and high-net-worth individuals across the United States. The company's core business model is structured around four main pillars: first, it acts as an investment bank, helping clients raise capital by selling stocks or bonds and advising on mergers; second, it provides consulting and financial advice, often to companies facing distress or bankruptcy; third, it runs liquidation and auction services, specializing in selling off assets and inventory, particularly from failed retail chains; and fourth, it uses its own capital to buy stakes in other public and private businesses (called principal investments). Its revenue streams are varied, often relying on transaction fees and the performance of its own proprietary investment portfolio, making its financial results highly dependent on overall economic and market activity.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk for B. Riley is the volatility and cyclicality inherent in its principal investments and investment banking segments. Historically, when stock markets slow down or interest rates rise, transaction activity decreases sharply, lowering the fees RILY collects, a recurring issue that all investment banks face. A specific risk to RILY is the concentration of its principal investments; if a few key holdings perform poorly or fail, it can result in major immediate losses to RILY’s balance sheet. A long-term risk relates to regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm, especially given the complex and often distressed nature of the companies RILY advises or invests in. Should the company or its affiliates be implicated in controversies, this regulatory threat can erode investor confidence and restrict its ability to attract clients and funding. This risk is particularly concerning now, as public confidence directly impacts its ability to access the debt markets required to fund its core operations and principal investments.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY) from its beginning to its current status, using simple, jargon-free language.

---

### **A History of B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY)**

#### **I. The Inception and Founding Purpose (1997)**

1.  **Founding:** The company was first established in 1997 by Bryant Riley in Los Angeles, California, under the name B. Riley & Co.
2.  **Founding Purpose (The Gap):** Its initial goal was to serve small and middle-market companies, which were often overlooked and underserved by the major, larger Wall Street investment banks.
3.  **Initial Focus:** The firm started as a boutique investment bank, primarily offering stock-picking research and services for smaller companies to institutional investors.

#### **II. The Journey to Diversification (Innovative Solution)**

4.  **First Big Pivot:** In June 2014, the key strategic move occurred when B. Riley & Co. merged with the **Great American Group (GAG)**, an appraisal and liquidation service provider.
5.  **The Birth of RILY:** This merger officially created B. Riley Financial, Inc. and led to its listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange, establishing it as a publicly traded company.
6.  **Innovative Solution (The Diversified Platform):** The new business model was unique: it combined traditional Wall Street activities (like investment banking) with less traditional activities (like corporate restructuring and asset liquidation/auction).
7.  **The Goal of the Platform:** The overall goal became to offer a "full-service, collaborative solution" to clients at every stage of their business life, from needing capital (banking) to needing to sell off assets quickly (liquidation).

#### **III. Growth, Acquisitions, and Tailwinds**

8.  **Rapid Expansion through Acquisitions:** After 2014, B. Riley pursued an aggressive strategy of buying complementary businesses to build out its full-service model.
9.  **Key Expansions:** This included acquiring firms like FBR & Co. to significantly boost its investment banking scale and Wunderlich Securities to expand its wealth management business.
10. **The "Retail Apocalypse" Tailwind:** The growth of their liquidation and auction services segment, inherited from the Great American Group merger, proved to be a major advantage.
11. **Leveraging Economic Headwinds:** As many traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores closed down, this "retail apocalypse" became a financial tailwind for B. Riley, as they were the company that specialized in liquidating or auctioning off the assets of these distressed businesses.
12. **Peak Recognition:** This diversified model and strategic growth led to significant success, culminating in the company being ranked as high as #2 on *FORTUNE's* 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list in 2021.

#### **IV. Problems and Headwinds**

13. **Early Setback:** The company faced a small regulatory issue early on, being fined $5,000 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1997 for lax record-keeping.
14. **The Core Risk:** A significant challenge, or risk, of the diversified model is that it involves using the firm's own capital for investments (known as proprietary trading), which can lead to volatility.
15. **Short-Seller Criticism:** In recent years (2023), B. Riley faced public criticism from a short-seller report alleging the company over-leveraged and lent money to companies with a high risk of defaulting.
16. **Recent Financial and Legal Headwinds:** More recently, the company's stock price and public perception were negatively affected by an SEC investigation related to a securities fraud case involving a client to whom B. Riley had lent a substantial amount of money.
17. **Navigating the Turbulence:** In response, B. Riley filed its delayed 2023 annual report and announced it had conducted independent reviews regarding the relationship, while also focusing on asset sales to reduce debt and improve its financial stability.

#### **V. Present Day and Company Goal**

18. **Current Identity:** B. Riley Financial is a diversified financial services firm that operates through six main business areas: Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Financial Consulting, Auction and Liquidation, Communications, and Consumer products.
19. **The Enduring Goal:** The overarching goal remains to act as an integrated partner for its clients, offering solutions across the entire business life cycle, from raising money and managing wealth to restructuring or closing down a business and selling its assets.
20. **Competitive Edge:** By providing this unique combination of traditional finance services (like banking) and non-traditional services (like liquidation), B. Riley Financial aims to maintain a distinct position in the financial industry, particularly for the small and middle-market companies it was founded to serve.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of B. Riley Financial (RILY) is not built on a single, massive advantage, but rather on an unusual and specialized *combination* of financial services, particularly its focus on the underserved middle market and distressed companies.

### Analysis of B. Riley's Competitive Moat

1.  **Integrated Financial Solutions Platform:** B. Riley’s core moat is its "full-service, collaborative solution" platform, which combines capital markets, wealth management, financial consulting, and unique asset disposition services. This integrated approach allows a single client to receive investment banking, restructuring advisory, and even asset liquidation services from one firm, which differentiates it from larger, more specialized Wall Street firms and smaller boutiques.
2.  **Middle-Market and Special Situations Niche:** The company has carved out a distinct and profitable niche by serving the often-underserved middle market and specializing in complex, distressed situations like bankruptcies and corporate restructuring. This expertise is a significant competitive advantage as few firms offer the combined capabilities of capital raising and deep operational/liquidation advisory for complex deals.
3.  **Proprietary Capital Deployment:** A key differentiator is RILY's willingness to invest its own capital ("Principal Investments") directly into deals and companies that originate from its advisory and investment banking activities. This ability to be both an advisor *and* a principal helps solidify its involvement in certain transactions and drives significant, albeit volatile, returns.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Special Pricing Power from Integration:** The ability to offer tailored, integrated, end-to-end solutions for complex business problems can justify a premium price, as clients are essentially buying a one-stop-shop for a full business life-cycle. This customized, holistic approach gives them an advantage over competitors who can only offer siloed services.
2.  **Valuable Auction and Liquidation Expertise:** RILY is a leader in auction and liquidation services, particularly through its Great American Group subsidiary, a service often vital during corporate restructuring. This specialized operational expertise is difficult to replicate quickly and provides a reliable revenue stream often counter-cyclical to its capital markets business.

### Customer Stickiness and Recurrence

1.  **Mixed Customer Stickiness:** Customer stickiness is high in the **Wealth Management** and general **Advisory/Consulting** segments, where relationships are long-term, creating recurring revenue. However, its **Auction and Liquidation** services typically involve short-term contracts, generally under six months, and do not provide recurring revenue from year to year.
2.  **Reputation and Relationships as Network Effects:** The growth of the platform has been driven by strategic acquisitions and the synergies created by cross-platform expertise, which acts as a strong internal network effect. This structure is intended to ensure that a client entering any one segment is more likely to use services from another segment.
3.  **Reputational Risk is a Weakness:** The stickiness of clients in the financial services world heavily depends on trust and reputation, and recent high-profile investment losses and regulatory scrutiny pose a significant risk to client retention and its overall moat. A decline in reputation can lead to an exodus of both clients and key revenue-generating employees.

### Displacement Risk and Innovation

1.  **Displacement by Capital is Not Easy:** While a competitor with more capital (like a bulge-bracket bank) could technically try to enter the middle-market, RILY's moat is based on a culture of **opportunism, integration, and specific expertise** in distressed situations, not just sheer size. A large competitor would need to build or acquire this diverse set of specialized capabilities, which is a difficult and time-consuming task.
2.  **Growth from Strategic Expansion:** The company’s growth into what it is today was a deliberate strategy of expansion through mergers and acquisitions, broadening its service offerings to cover the entire business lifecycle, moving far beyond its origins as a boutique investment bank.
3.  **Innovation Focus:** The company’s innovation strategy is focused on leveraging technology to improve client services and capitalize on emerging trends like AI and digital assets. It must constantly innovate in its service delivery and remain current with market sectors, but its edge comes more from its **specialized human capital and deal-making** than high R&D spending on new technology.

## Catalyst Analysis

B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY) is a diversified financial services company. Its catalysts, or factors that could increase the stock price, are primarily tied to resolving recent operational and investment-related challenges while capitalizing on the strengths of its core businesses.

### Near-Term Stock Price Catalysts

These are factors that could drive the stock price up in the immediate future, often related to clearing uncertainty and demonstrating financial stability.

1.  **Resolving Financial and Regulatory Delays.** The company must quickly resolve its filing delinquencies for the 2024 Form 10-K and 2025 quarterly reports to regain full compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. Management is currently in the late stages of documenting the 2024 annual audit, with the goal of filing all delinquent reports shortly thereafter to return to a normal filing cadence in 2025.
2.  **Successful Debt Reduction and Deleveraging.** B. Riley is prioritizing paying down its debt, which includes a recent private bond exchange that reduced total debt by approximately $18 million. Management has stated a focus on maintaining a strong, flexible balance sheet and has paused the common stock dividend to prioritize debt retirement.
3.  **Monetization of Principal Investments.** The company is focused on maximizing the value of its existing investments and principal positions, which have recently resulted in large non-cash write-downs. A successful sale or a favorable strategic review of an asset like the Great American Group business could immediately unlock value.
4.  **Strong Performance in Core Operating Businesses.** Management emphasizes the consistent profitability of its core financial services businesses, including B. Riley Securities and Advisory Services. Continued strong operating adjusted EBITDA from these segments will provide a stable foundation and demonstrate that the business is healthy despite investment volatility.

### Long-Term Stock Price Catalysts and Management Strategy

These are fundamental shifts and strategic initiatives aimed at long-term growth and reduced volatility.

1.  **Refocus on Core Financial Services.** The company is strategically shifting back to its roots, focusing on its core financial services and capital markets platform. This realignment is expected to position the firm to deploy capital and leverage cash flow more effectively.
2.  **Carve-out of B. Riley Securities.** The separate carve-out of B. Riley Securities is a strategic step aimed at maximizing the value of the investment banking and brokerage arm. This could lead to a clearer valuation for the capital markets business.
3.  **Capitalizing on Market Opportunities.** Management believes the firm is uniquely positioned to execute in the financial services sector and expects to capitalize on renewed optimism and activity in small-cap stocks.
4.  **Steady Cash Flow from Diversified Portfolio.** In addition to financial services, the company benefits from steady, reliable cash flow generated by its other subsidiaries, such as the communications and brands portfolios. These consistent, less-volatile businesses provide a buffer for the cyclical capital markets segments.
5.  **Restoration of the Dividend.** Management's long-term strategy includes returning capital to shareholders, as evidenced by a history of paying a dividend every quarter until its recent suspension. The resumption of the common dividend, following the successful deleveraging, would signal a return to financial strength and is a strong catalyst for long-term investors.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings, including the DEF 14A proxy statements for B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY), here is a summary of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors (Alignment)**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** The Co-Chief Executive Officer, Bryant Riley, directly owns a substantial portion of the company's shares, reported at **22.6%** of the total outstanding stock.
2.  **Conclusion on Ownership:** This significant ownership stake is a **strong indicator of alignment** with shareholder interests, as the manager's personal wealth is directly and heavily tied to the company's long-term stock performance.

#### **Compensation Structure and Philosophy**

3.  **Entrepreneurial Culture:** The stated objective of B. Riley's compensation programs is to "foster an entrepreneurial, results-focused culture" to support the long-term growth of stockholder value.
4.  **Performance-Based Focus:** The overall executive pay structure heavily emphasizes performance-based components (bonuses and incentives) over a fixed base salary, which is a common corporate governance practice to align pay with results.
5.  **Shift to Revenue-Based Pay (New Structure):** The CEO's compensation structure has been revised to be **primarily based on revenue generated** through investment banking activities at B. Riley Securities. This moves compensation directly in line with deal-making and transactional success.
6.  **Minimal Base Salary:** Under the new agreement, the CEO's fixed compensation is reduced to a minimal annual wage threshold, making his earnings highly dependent on transactional performance and variable incentives.
7.  **Incentive Holdback Mechanism:** A portion of the incentive program payments (e.g., 20% starting in fiscal year 2026) is subject to a **holdback** and is payable at the compensation committee's discretion based on individual and corporate performance, which acts as a check on pure revenue chasing.

#### **Conclusion: Incentive Alignment with Shareholders**

8.  **Strong Alignment:** Management, particularly the CEO, has a **high incentive to act in the interest of shareholders** primarily due to the **very high insider ownership** (22.6%), meaning their wealth largely tracks the stock price.
9.  **Incentive to Perform:** The compensation structure, especially the recent shift to a revenue-generation model, strongly incentivizes managers to be **results-focused and entrepreneurial**.
10. **Risk of Self-Enrichment:** The high reliance on *revenue generation* could potentially **incentivize high-volume or high-risk transactions** to maximize incentive payments, though the 20% performance-based holdback may mitigate this risk by linking a portion of the payment to overall corporate success.

## Price History

Based on recent market data and technical analysis, here is an analysis of B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY) stock price history.

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading significantly above its 52-week low. With a recent price of approximately **\$4.23** and a 52-week low of **\$2.67**, the stock is approximately **58.43%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Relative Price Range:** Despite being well above its absolute low, the stock is currently trading in the **lower part of its 52-week range** (which is **\$2.67 to \$7.90**) and near the recent lows of its monthly trading range.

3.  **Technical Analysis:** The technical outlook is mixed but indicates significant negative pressure. The short-term trend is classified as **negative** or a **strong sell** by some technical ratings, and the price is trading below declining long-term moving averages (like the 200-day Simple Moving Average).

4.  **Oversold Indicators:** Some technical indicators, such as the Stochastic Oscillator, have suggested the stock may be in an **oversold** condition, which can sometimes precede a price reversal, but other analysis suggests waiting for a consolidation due to high volatility.

5.  **Big Stock Price Drop Explained:** The stock experienced a massive plunge, including one single-day drop of over **50%** in August 2024, due to a series of concerning events.

6.  **Reason for the Plunge (Losses):** The primary catalyst was the announcement of preliminary earnings results that included a net loss of up to \$475 million, largely driven by a substantial impairment charge of up to **\$370 million** related to its investment in **Franchise Group, Inc. (FRG)**.

7.  **Reason for the Plunge (Regulatory and Dividends):** The turmoil was compounded by a report that the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** was investigating the company's disclosure of asset risks, and B. Riley Financial also announced the **suspension of its common and preferred stock dividends** to strengthen its balance sheet.

---

## Long Thesis

The stock is heavily undervalued because investors are focused on recent large investment losses and debt problems. The immediate bull case centers on management successfully cleaning up the balance sheet by selling assets, paying down debt, and fixing all delayed regulatory filings. This will remove the deep uncertainty surrounding the company. For the long term, B. Riley's powerful advantage is its unique platform that serves middle-market companies across their entire lifecycle—from raising money (banking) to handling major problems and asset sales (liquidation). Once the crisis passes, these consistently profitable operating segments will drive strong, stable cash flow, allowing the company to reduce risk, stop using its own capital for risky deals, and eventually resume its historic dividend, leading to a significant recovery in share price.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This scenario depends on several key things happening: 1. Management must quickly resolve all overdue financial reports and regulatory investigations to fully restore trust. 2. The company must successfully sell enough non-core assets to significantly pay down its high-interest debt and stabilize the balance sheet. 3. The profitable core businesses (like advisory and wealth management) must maintain their strong performance and not suffer from reputational damage caused by recent controversies. 4. Economic conditions must remain stable enough to allow for continued merger activity and demand for their specialized advisory services.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The following critique identifies holes and flaws in the bullish thesis for B. Riley Financial, Inc. (RILY), which are synthesized into a consolidated bear case.

### Critique and Identified Flaws in the Long Thesis

#### **1. Flaw in "Management must quickly resolve all overdue financial reports and regulatory investigations to fully restore trust."**

*   **Persistent Regulatory and Filing Risk:** The assumption of a "quick fix" is contradicted by ongoing events. The company has repeatedly delayed filing multiple quarterly reports (Q1, Q2, and Q3 2025 Form 10-Qs) and has received multiple delisting threat notices from Nasdaq, indicating a deep, persistent issue, not a temporary delay.
*   **Widespread Investigations:** The uncertainty is far from removed; it has widened. B. Riley faces separate, major investigations from the SEC and FINRA, including a probe into possible securities violations tied to its wealth management practices and a widening investigation into its accounting and disclosure practices, particularly regarding the Franchise Group (FRG) transactions and dealings with former CEO Brian Kahn.
*   **Fundamental Trust Issue:** The core problem is not just *late* reports, but the difficulty in *valuing its assets* and the investigation into the adequacy of its risk disclosures, which undermines the credibility of the entire balance sheet until new audits are completed and filed.

#### **2. Flaw in "The company must successfully sell enough non-core assets to significantly pay down its high-interest debt and stabilize the balance sheet."**

*   **Significant Remaining Debt Load:** While B. Riley has pursued asset sales and debt exchanges (e.g., brand assets sale for $236 million and approximately $126 million in debt reduction via bond exchanges), the total debt remains high. Estimated net debt as of mid-2025 is still projected to be in the range of $809 million to $839 million, meaning the debt problem is not easily resolved by a few non-core asset sales.
*   **Uncertainty of Asset Valuation:** The delay in regulatory filings has been attributed to problems in valuing its loans and investments, suggesting that the carrying value of its assets, including those slated for sale, may be overstated, leading to lower-than-expected proceeds and further losses.

#### **3. Flaw in "The profitable core businesses... must maintain their strong performance and not suffer from reputational damage..."**

*   **Direct Reputational Harm to Core Segments:** The FINRA investigation directly targets potential securities violations tied to the **Wealth Management** segment, and the broader SEC probe centers on its capital markets deals. This direct link to regulatory scrutiny and a high-profile scandal (FRG/Kahn) creates a significant risk of client and key talent attrition across the entire financial services platform.
*   **Business Model Risk (Using Own Capital):** The very feature that is touted as a unique advantage—using its balance sheet for "risky deals"—is what drove the recent catastrophic losses and high leverage. The promise to "stop using its own capital for risky deals" may be forced by necessity rather than strategic choice, potentially removing a key differentiator and profit source, or it may be abandoned entirely, continuing the cycle of risk.

#### **4. Flaw in "Once the crisis passes... consistently profitable operating segments will drive strong, stable cash flow... and eventually resume its historic dividend."**

*   **Profitability Was Not Consistent/Stable:** The company has reported three consecutive years of losses and a massive recent quarterly loss, demonstrating that the business model's profitability is highly volatile and sensitive to investment losses and market-making activities, directly contradicting the term "consistently profitable" in the thesis.
*   **Dividend Resumption is a Distant Hope:** The dividend was suspended to conserve cash, and with the high debt load, significant interest payments, and the need to restore a stable balance sheet, any resumption of the "historic dividend" is likely years away, eroding the investment return profile for income-focused investors.

***

### Bear Case Thesis

The optimistic "crisis passing" narrative for B. Riley Financial is fundamentally flawed due to the severity, breadth, and nature of its systemic issues. The stock is a high-risk bet on an unlikely turnaround, facing multiple, compounding headwinds.

1.  **Imminent Solvency and Liquidity Concerns:** The high total debt load, coupled with multi-year operating losses and a significant reduction in the value of its investment portfolio, raises fundamental questions about the company's long-term solvency. The balance sheet remains highly leveraged, with an asset-to-equity ratio that exposes the firm to severe liquidity risk if its remaining assets cannot be monetized at their stated book value or if credit markets tighten.
2.  **Unresolved and Widening Regulatory/Accounting Scrutiny:** The ongoing, widening SEC and FINRA investigations, compounded by an inability to file timely financial reports due to asset valuation challenges, represent a profound loss of regulatory and investor trust. This uncertainty will continue to depress the stock price and could lead to severe penalties, sanctions, or even a forced delisting if compliance is not quickly achieved.
3.  **Fundamental Reputation Damage to Core Business:** The direct involvement of the firm and its executives in the high-profile scandal surrounding the collapse of FRG and Brian Kahn, combined with a FINRA probe into its wealth management practices, inflicts lasting reputational damage. This will likely lead to reduced client flow and key employee departures in its supposedly "profitable core businesses," degrading the "unique platform" advantage and future earnings power.
4.  **A Business Model Built on Volatility and Risk:** The core strategy of using the balance sheet to take principal risk in complex middle-market deals is structurally flawed, as demonstrated by the massive investment losses that caused the current crisis. The firm's long-term profitability is highly volatile and dependent on successfully executing high-risk, non-recurring transactions, making future cash flow and earnings inherently unstable and unpredictable.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis and the results of the initial search, the picture for B. Riley Financial is clearer but remains highly complex and uncertain. The key challenge for the investment thesis (bull or bear) is the opacity of the balance sheet due to delayed filings and the ongoing restructuring of the business and capital structure.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further:

### **Immediate, High-Impact Next Steps**

1.  **Determine the True State of Regulatory Compliance and Filings:**
    *   The most recent information shows the company filed its Q1 2025 10-Q in November 2025 and is transitioning to a new auditor (BDO). You must verify the filing status of the **2024 Form 10-K, Q2 2025 10-Q, and Q3 2025 10-Q** to confirm if they have regained full Nasdaq compliance.
    *   **Question to Ask:** Has B. Riley received a formal notice of compliance from Nasdaq, or is the threat of delisting still a factor, merely delayed?

2.  **Verify the Status and Impact of the Founder Buyout:**
    *   The analysis mentioned a "late 2024" buyout proposal, and the search confirmed the founder's $7.00 per share proposal on August 16, 2024. **Crucially, a search result from March 2025 indicates Bryant Riley ended his buyout efforts after failing to secure financing for a formal bid.**
    *   **Question to Ask:** Did the announcement that the buyout was *ended* have a major subsequent impact on the stock price? This event is highly relevant and likely cancels out the "buyout catalyst" entirely, shifting focus back to core operations.

3.  **Analyze the Proceeds and Use of the Asset Sale:**
    *   The Great American Group (GAG) sale to Oaktree closed in November 2024. The deal generated approximately **$203 million in cash** and left B. Riley with a 47% minority stake valued at about $183 million.
    *   **Question to Ask:** How specifically was the \$203 million cash used? Did the proceeds go entirely toward paying down the high-interest 2026 debt maturities, or was it used for other expenses/working capital? (The answer is key to validating the deleveraging catalyst).

### **Critical Financial and Operational Questions**

4.  **Pinpoint the Remaining Debt Wall and Maturity Schedule:**
    *   The company has executed multiple debt exchanges, reducing the 2026 debt wall, which includes notes due March 31, 2026, and December 31, 2026. The most recent filing should contain a definitive schedule.
    *   **Action:** Search for the specific remaining principal amounts and the nearest *major* maturity dates beyond the 2026 notes. This determines the *timeline* of the short thesis's solvency concerns.

5.  **Evaluate the Real Impact of Reputational Damage:**
    *   The bear case highlights the risk of client/employee attrition due to the SEC/FINRA probes (linked to the FRG/Kahn scandal) and wealth management scrutiny.
    *   **Action:** Search for news articles regarding notable **executive or key banker departures** from B. Riley Securities or B. Riley Wealth Management since the Q3/Q4 2024 controversies. Client attrition is harder to track but key departures signal internal loss of confidence.

6.  **Investigate the Status of the Principal Investment (FRG Loan):**
    *   The massive write-down was related to the loan collateralized by Franchise Group, Inc. (FRG) equity.
    *   **Action:** Determine the *current carrying value* of the remaining FRG-related loan/investment on the most recently filed balance sheet (Q1 2025 10-Q). This remaining amount represents the final exposure to the catastrophe.
