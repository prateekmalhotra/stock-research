## Business Summary

Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) operates primarily as a designer, marketer, and distributor of small electric household appliances, such as blenders, coffee makers, and toasters. The core business model involves outsourcing almost all manufacturing, primarily to factories in Asia, allowing HBB to focus resources on branding, product design, and efficient logistics. They act as the middleman between the factory and the final retailer. HBB sells its products mainly to large mass merchants and e-commerce platforms (like Walmart and Amazon) across North America, serving the everyday consumer who needs affordable replacement or upgrade items. A smaller, yet important, segment of their business involves selling commercial-grade equipment (B2B) directly to food service establishments like restaurants and bars. While focusing mostly on the U.S. and Canadian household market, the company is actively expanding its sales presence internationally, particularly in Mexico and Latin America.

## Business Model Risk

HBB faces significant near-term risks centered around supply chain stability and inventory management. Since the company relies heavily on outsourced manufacturing, predominantly in China, it is highly sensitive to geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and drastic fluctuations in ocean freight costs. The inability to predict consumer demand correctly can result in either being stuck with excessive inventory (which requires deep discounts to clear, harming earnings) or missing sales opportunities. In the long term, the primary threat is intense competition in the appliance market. HBB operates in a high-volume, low-margin environment where brand rivals and generic private-label brands constantly engage in price wars, making it difficult to maintain market share and profit margins. This threat is compounded by the substantial buying power of their few major retail customers; if a key retailer chooses to reduce orders or demand better pricing, HBB's profitability is immediately harmed. During periods of economic downturn, such as recessions, consumers often delay purchasing new appliances, which historically causes a sharp, immediate decline in sales for HBB and is a recurring cause for concern.

## Company History

The history of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) is a story of turning innovative motor technology into everyday household and commercial appliances, adapting over a century of changes in manufacturing and retail.

### **Inception and Founding Purpose (Early 1900s - 1910)**

1.  **Technological Foundation:** The company’s roots begin with inventor Chester Beach, who perfected a high-speed, lightweight "universal" electric motor in the early 1900s. This motor was revolutionary because it could run on both alternating and direct current, making it versatile for new household appliances.
2.  **Founding the Company:** In April 1910, the Hamilton Beach Manufacturing Company was officially established in Racine, Wisconsin, by inventor Frederick J. Osius. The company was named after two men Osius hired: Louis Hamilton (Advertising Manager) and Chester Beach (Mechanic/Engineer).
3.  **The Core Purpose:** The business was founded to commercialize the universal motor and produce motor-driven electrical devices for household use, ending the era of muscle-powered chores like mixing. The initial goal was to improve and simplify daily life for consumers by bringing commercial-grade technology into the home.
4.  **First Iconic Product:** One of their first successful products, introduced in 1910, was the famous electric **"Cyclone Drink Mixer,"** which quickly became a staple in soda fountains across North America. They also pioneered the first food mixer mounted on its own stand.

### **Evolution and Key Milestones (1920s - 2017)**

5.  **Early Growth and Corporate Shifts:** In 1922, the company was sold to Scovill Manufacturing, and for decades, its products were marketed as "Hamilton Beach Scovill." This provided a large corporate structure and resources to expand their product lines, which included electric fans, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers.
6.  **Major Strategic Consolidation:** A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Hamilton Beach merged with **Proctor Silex**, another well-known appliance manufacturer. This merger united two major players to create the largest U.S. manufacturer of small kitchen appliances, significantly increasing its market share and resources.
7.  **Becoming Publicly Traded:** The company became part of NACCO Industries in 1999 and later, in 2017, it was spun off to become an independent, publicly traded entity under the name **Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB)**. This transition gave the company more independence and access to capital for new growth strategies.

### **Headwinds and Problems Faced**

8.  **The "Made in China" Headwind (Early 2000s):** To remain competitive on price, the company, like many in the industry, shifted its manufacturing to subcontractors primarily in China, which later created vulnerabilities.
9.  **Geopolitical and Trade Policy Challenges:** In recent years (2025), the company has faced a major headwind from U.S. consumer inventory pauses and retaliatory tariffs related to US-China trade tensions. This uncertainty in trade policy has negatively impacted revenue and cash flow at times.
10. **Retail Operations Failure:** A significant internal challenge was the wind-down and closure of its retail stores, The Kitchen Collection, LLC, in 2019, which required them to restructure their business and report the division as discontinued operations.

### **Innovative Solutions and Tailwinds for Growth**

11. **The "Good Thinking" Culture:** The company’s core culture, which emphasizes "consumer-driven innovation," has been a key driver in navigating competition. This focus helps them design products that solve real-world problems for users.
12. **Innovative Product Diversification:** To combat competition and low-margin products, the company began strategically shifting toward higher-margin, premium, and specialty products.
13. **Licensing and Specialty Partnerships:** They leveraged licensing agreements to enter new, premium categories, such as the *CHI* line for garment care and the *Bartesian* cocktail maker. These partnerships help capture emerging consumer trends and diversify revenue.
14. **Tailwind of E-commerce Growth:** The company benefited from the tailwind of the shift to online shopping by establishing a strong presence across e-commerce platforms, with the channel accounting for a large portion of its total revenue (38% in 2022).
15. **Mitigating China Risk (A Solution to the Headwind):** To lessen the risk of tariffs and trade volatility, the company implemented a solution to diversify its global supply chain, shifting a portion of its production to suppliers outside of China.
16. **New Market Entry – Health:** The most recent major innovation is the creation of the Hamilton Beach Health subsidiary, which focuses on the home health market. This move included acquiring HealthBeacon, a medical technology firm that develops digitally connected devices to help patients manage chronic conditions at home.

### **Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Today**

17. **Current Goals:** Today, HBB's goal is to deliver profitable growth through innovative solutions that improve everyday living, focusing on its consumer brands (like Hamilton Beach and Proctor Silex) and its expanding commercial and health divisions.
18. **Market Position:** The company remains a leading designer, marketer, and distributor of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, holding a top brand position in the U.S. small kitchen appliance market by units sold.
19. **Business Structure:** It operates as a holding company for its various brands, selling products through mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, and wholesale distributors in North America and other international markets.

## Moat Analysis

This analysis of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) focuses on its competitive advantages and market position in the small appliance industry.

### Analysis of Hamilton Beach's Moat

1.  **Established Brand Heritage and Portfolio Scale:** The company's primary moat is its long-standing brand recognition, leveraging over 100 years of history in the market. They strategically use multiple brands, such as the value-focused **Proctor Silex** and the mid-range **Hamilton Beach**, to cover a broad spectrum of the budget-conscious consumer market.

2.  **Specialized Commercial Market Leadership:** A significant differentiator is their leadership position in the **Global Commercial market**, providing heavy-duty small appliances to restaurants, bars, and hotels worldwide. This B2B segment is distinct, less sensitive to impulse buying, and often demands high reliability, creating stickier customer relationships than the consumer retail space.

3.  **Unique Platform/Consumable Partnerships:** Hamilton Beach differentiates itself by entering into exclusive, multiyear agreements for high-margin, specialized appliances like the **Bartesian** cocktail maker and **Numilk** plant-based milk maker. These products create an "ecosystem" business model, which can lead to recurring revenue from the necessary, proprietary consumables (like pods) used in the machines.

4.  **Strategic Move into Healthcare Technology:** The company is intentionally diversifying its business through **Hamilton Beach Health**, which includes the acquisition of HealthBeacon, a medical technology firm for connected home healthcare devices. This move aims to enter a fast-growing, higher-margin sector and build a business model that incorporates software and recurring services, enhancing the overall moat.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

5.  **Pricing Power is Segmented:** In its core consumer appliance market, HBB competes largely on affordability and functionality, which limits its ability to drastically raise prices (low pricing power). However, its strategic focus on **premium, commercial, and health segments** is explicitly designed to shift the product mix toward higher-priced, higher-margin offerings to improve overall pricing power.

6.  **"Good, Better, Best" Strategy:** The use of multiple brands—from the value-driven Proctor Silex to the Hamilton Beach Professional line and licensed premium brands—allows them to command various price points without losing the budget-conscious customer. This segmentation helps maintain volume in the high-demand, low-end market while increasing profit margins in the niche or premium categories.

### Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk

7.  **Customer Contracts and Stickiness:** The consumer business is primarily based on one-time purchases, though a customer repeat purchase rate of 62% shows decent brand loyalty. The most "sticky" and recurring revenue is expected from the **Commercial segment** (B2B relationships with distributors) and the new **Health/Appliance-Consumable segments** (like Bartesian and HealthBeacon software), which rely on recurring consumables or service subscriptions.

8.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** Hamilton Beach is susceptible to being displaced in its core consumer market, as a competitor with more capital could heavily invest in marketing, undercut prices, or secure better placement with key retailers. The company relies heavily on a few large customers (like Walmart and Amazon), which creates a concentration risk.

### Investment in R&D and Innovation

9.  **Constant Innovation as a Necessity:** The small appliance market is highly competitive, meaning the company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge; in the last five years, they have launched over 250 new product platforms. R&D spending is a consistent but modest part of the business, focusing on "consumer-driven innovation" and cost-effective design.

10. **Focus on Consumer Pain Points:** The company’s long-term success is built on its "Good Thinking" culture, which emphasizes solving everyday problems and designing functional, affordable products. This focus on practical, consumer-driven innovation is the engine that has sustained the brand for over a century, rather than solely on groundbreaking, high-technology invention.

## Catalyst Analysis

The analysis of catalysts for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) is based on recent news, press releases, and summaries from the Q2 2025, Q1 2025, and Q4 2024 earnings periods.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Within the next year)

1.  **Resolution of Tariff Uncertainty and Inventory Normalization:** The stock price is currently pressured by significant trade disruptions and paused retailer purchases caused by new U.S. tariffs on China imports. A resolution to the tariff situation or the complete passing of price increases to the consumer could lead to retailers resuming normal buying volumes and a recovery in the U.S. consumer business.

2.  **Margin Expansion from Cost Actions:** Management has implemented decisive actions, including selective price increases and restructuring efforts like an 8% workforce reduction, to lessen the impact of revenue decline on profitability. Successful execution of these cost reductions should protect and further expand the company's gross profit margin.

3.  **Growth from New Premium Products:** The recent launch of the new premium "Lotus" brand, featuring products like the Lotus Perfectionist oven, is expected to receive extensive marketing support and drive sales in the higher-end appliance segment.

4.  **Shareholder Return Program:** The company continues its policy of returning value to shareholders through regular cash dividends, which were recently raised, and a share repurchase program.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond one year)

1.  **Manufacturing and Supply Chain Diversification:** Management is accelerating its strategy to shift manufacturing away from China to other Asia-Pacific countries, which is expected to mitigate the impact of tariffs and stabilize margins in the long term, with benefits anticipated in 2026.

2.  **Expansion into Connected Health (HealthBeacon):** The acquisition of HealthBeacon, which operates at a significantly higher gross margin, is a key component of the long-term strategy. Management expects "significant growth in patient subscriptions" from this higher-margin business line.

3.  **Growth in Commercial and International Markets:** An increased proportion of sales from the International Commercial business has already helped improve gross margin, demonstrating that continued expansion in this high-margin segment is a structural long-term driver.

4.  **Strategic Commercial Partnerships and Innovation:** New commercial deals, such as the Sunkist partnership, are expected to contribute significantly to future revenue. The company continues to focus on product innovation to capture market share, as seen in the success of new products like the FlexBrew 5-in-1 coffee maker in 2024.

***

### Management's Explicit Strategy (from Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Mitigating Tariffs:** CEO R. Scott Tidey emphasized responding to significant trade disruptions by "accelerating our manufacturing diversification, implementing select price increases, and reducing our fixed cost base" to navigate the current environment.
*   **Focus on Profitable Growth Segments:** Management highlighted that the expansion in gross profit margin was due to a shift toward higher-margin businesses, including the International Commercial business and the HealthBeacon segment.
*   **Investing for Future Growth:** The capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in the core business, such as launching the new premium Lotus brand and new products, while also using cash flow to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders.

4.  **Management Transition:** Former CEO Gregory H. Trepp retired at the end of 2024, having served as President and CEO since the company's spin-off in 2017 and leading the core subsidiary since 2010. The transition to Tidey was a planned succession, and no known disagreements led to the change.
5.  **Track Record (Trepp Era):** Trepp's tenure is credited by the Board for building a strong team and a "Good Thinking" culture, and for successes including market share growth in core brands, expanding the premium and global commercial markets, and progress in the e-commerce channel.

### Strategy, Vision, and Key Decisions

6.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** The company's strategic vision is to achieve leadership positions across consumer, commercial, and health appliances, with a mission to deliver profitable growth through innovative solutions.
7.  **Key Strategic Initiative:** A major focus is the growth of the Hamilton Beach Health subsidiary, which expanded significantly with the acquisition of medical technology firm HealthBeacon in early 2024.

This outperformance against the small kitchen appliance industry demonstrates effective execution of their core business strategy.
11. **Long-Term Shareholder Value:** Despite recent positive financial results and shareholder returns, the company's market capitalization decreased significantly—over 50%—from its spin-off in 2017 to late 2025.

### Analyst Sentiment

12. **Popularity and Sentiment:** As of late 2025, the consensus analyst rating for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company stock is a "Hold." The limited analyst coverage for the stock makes future growth forecasts less reliable.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) management incentives and compensation is based on the general structure outlined in its most recent Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), filed in March 2025.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (HBB)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Insider Ownership Structure:** Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company's capital structure includes two classes of common stock: Class A (one vote per share) and Class B (which typically carries a disproportionate voting right and is historically held by the original control group).
2.  **Managerial Interest:** While the exact collective beneficial ownership percentage for all directors and executive officers is difficult to pinpoint without the full table, the dual-class structure suggests a strong, concentrated alignment of interests, particularly among those holding Class B shares.
3.  **Mandatory Share Holding:** Directors and the most senior management are subject to a stringent **10-year holding requirement** for a significant portion of their equity awards, which is a strong mechanism to force a long-term, shareholder-aligned perspective. Less senior management has holding periods of three to five years.

#### **2. Compensation Structure**

4.  **Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:** The compensation philosophy is explicitly designed to be **substantially performance-based** (or "at-risk"), meaning a significant majority of executive pay is tied to the achievement of pre-established financial goals rather than fixed salary.
5.  **Short-Term Incentives (STI):** Annual cash bonuses are awarded based on the achievement of specific, measurable **financial and strategic goals**. For the CEO in a recent comparable period, over 70% of target total compensation was "at risk" and tied to company performance.
6.  **Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, paid in stock-based awards, is directly intended to help further long-term profits, growth, and the **enhancement of the Company's stockholder value** over multi-year periods.
7.  **Performance Metrics (General):** Compensation plans are tied to the segment operating profit, a metric the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) uses to assess profitability and performance of actual results against forecasts.

#### **3. Conclusion on Management Incentives**

8.  **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest (High):** Management is strongly incentivized to act in the long-term interest of shareholders, primarily due to the **mandatory 10-year share holding period** for senior executives and directors, which directly links their personal wealth to the company's sustained stock performance.
9.  **Protection Against Short-Term Pocket Lining:** The high percentage of compensation delivered through **performance-based equity** (LTI) that cannot be sold for a decade minimizes the incentive for short-term, unsustainable decisions or actions designed only to maximize an immediate cash bonus.
10. **Area for Investor Scrutiny:** The existence of the dual-class stock structure means that while management's economic interests are aligned (due to the holding requirements), the ability of minority Class A shareholders to exert influence may be limited by the concentrated voting power of the Class B holders.

## Price History

The price history for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) indicates a significant downward trend over the past year, with the stock currently trading near its 52-week low.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** As of late September 2025, the Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB) stock was trading around \$13.93. This price is near the bottom of its 52-week range, which spans from a low of \$12.72 to a high of \$31.78.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** The current price of the stock is approximately **9.51%** above its 52-week low of \$12.72. The 52-week high of \$31.78 suggests the current share price is significantly compressed relative to its high point over the past year.

3.  **Technical Analysis Suggests Trading Low:** Based on technical analysis, the stock appears to be trading low; it is below its 52-week average price of \$18.80 and has seen a severe decline of over 50% in the last year. The stock's price is also currently trading below key Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), confirming a bearish technical pattern.

4.  **Significant Price Drop:** HBB has experienced a substantial drop, trending down by over 50% in the past year and more than 27% in the previous six months leading up to September 2025. This performance contrasts sharply with the broader market's performance over the same period.

5.  **Reason for Recent Weakness/Drops:** The recent stock weakness has been attributed in part to broader economic factors and company-specific issues such as retailer inventory pauses and concerns related to tariffs.

6.  **Recent Rally (Up Bigly):** Despite the overall downward trend, the stock did see a notable rally in the months preceding the recent price, including a period around May 2025 where the stock rose by nearly 23%. This earlier momentum may have been connected to positive news or investor sentiment around the company's financial performance at the time, though the longer-term trend has been negative.

7.  **Recent Earnings and Dividend:** In July 2025, the company announced its Q2 2025 results, reporting GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of \$0.33 on revenues of \$127.8 million. Additionally, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of \$0.12 per share in August 2025.

## Long Thesis

Hamilton Beach Brands (HBB) is currently deeply undervalued because of temporary problems, such as retailer inventory pauses and trade tariff concerns. The bull case is based on a quick, strong recovery in the near term as these trade issues normalize and retailers resume normal stock orders. This immediate rebound is supported by the company's strong cost-cutting measures and price increases, which will rapidly expand profit margins and cash flow. The long-term upside comes from a strategic shift away from being just a low-margin appliance seller. HBB is aggressively moving into higher-profit business models: leading the specialized commercial equipment market, developing unique recurring revenue streams through specialized appliance/consumable partnerships (like the cocktail maker), and most importantly, expanding its high-margin Health division (HealthBeacon). This diversification into medical technology and subscription-based revenue will structurally improve HBB's profitability and justify a much higher stock valuation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The current disruptions related to tariffs and retailer inventory are temporary and will resolve within the next 12-18 months, leading to a quick recovery in core sales volume. The new, high-margin ventures—specifically the Health division (HealthBeacon) and the consumable partnerships (Bartesian)—must successfully scale up and start contributing a significantly larger portion of the company's overall profit. Management must successfully complete its supply chain diversification plan to stabilize costs and maintain the projected margin expansion, even if global trade uncertainty continues. Finally, the consumer market must avoid a severe recession that would halt discretionary spending on replacement appliances.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and flaws in the bullish thesis for Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB), particularly in the assumptions regarding the timing and nature of the recovery, the ability to rapidly expand cash flow, and the near-term impact of its new ventures.

### Bear Case Critique: Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Disruption is Structural and Prolonged, Not Temporary:** The thesis relies on trade issues being "temporary," but the CEO attributed the Q2 2025 18.2% revenue decline to significant trade disruptions and new tariffs, including a 145% increase on all Chinese exports, a **massive and potentially permanent cost pressure** on the core business. Management has also explicitly stated that full gross margin benefits from supply chain diversification are not expected until **2026**, contradicting the assumption of a "quick, strong recovery in the near term" (12-18 months).

2.  **Cash Flow is Deteriorating, Not Expanding:** The expectation of a "rapidly expand[ing]... cash flow" is directly contradicted by recent results. The company's strategy to mitigate tariffs by accelerating purchases and building inventory led to a **net cash *use*** of \$23.8 million in operating activities for the first half of 2025 and an increase in net debt from \$12.8 million to \$38.7 million year-over-year. This suggests tariff management is a significant, ongoing financial strain.

3.  **Margin Expansion is Overwhelmed by Volume Decline:** While the gross margin rate *increased* (160 basis points in Q2 2025), this was driven by a favorable shift in mix toward higher-margin commercial and health products, **not** a recovery in the core, high-volume consumer segment. The severe 18.2% drop in core sales volume resulted in a drop in absolute operating profit (from \$10.0 million to \$5.9 million in Q2 2025), indicating the shrinking core business is overpowering the high-margin gains.

4.  **New High-Margin Ventures Lack Necessary Scale in the Near Term:** The future valuation relies on the Health division (HealthBeacon) and consumable partnerships (Bartesian) contributing a "significantly larger portion" of profit. HealthBeacon revenue was only \$1.5 million in Q1 2025, an insignificant fraction of total company revenue (Q2 2025 total revenue was \$127.8 million). While high-margin, these ventures are currently too small to structurally offset the multi-million dollar operating profit decline in the core appliance business.

5.  **Consumer Market is Already Showing Recessionary Resistance:** The core assumption that the consumer market must *avoid* a severe recession is overly optimistic, as consumer resistance to price increases is already severely impacting sales. The dramatic revenue decline of over 18% in Q2 2025 was explicitly driven by retailers pausing orders to assess inventory and the impact of price hikes, which suggests demand is highly elastic at new, tariff-inflated price points. The broader consumer discretionary sector is shifting to "intentional consumption" which may resist purchasing non-essential replacement appliances.

## Next Steps

The analysis has effectively framed the investment thesis by highlighting the core conflict between the temporary headwind of tariffs and inventory pauses (Bull Case) and the structural risk of volume decline and low-margin competition (Bear Case).

The search results have successfully filled two major data gaps: **Valuation** and **Governance**. However, crucial forward-looking and quantitative data on the strategic growth segments (HealthBeacon, Bartesian) and the progress of supply chain diversification remain sparse.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for investigation:

### **Key Unanswered Questions and Next Steps**

1.  **Quantify the Scale-Up of High-Margin Ventures (HealthBeacon and Bartesian):**
    *   The long thesis hinges on the high-margin Health segment (HealthBeacon) becoming material, but its Q1 2025 revenue was only \$1.5 million. Investigate management's explicit, quantitative, multi-year revenue or subscription targets for both HealthBeacon and Bartesian to model their actual impact on the total company's profit margin and valuation.
    *   *Search Focus:* Search for specific forecasts like `"Hamilton Beach HealthBeacon 2026 revenue target"` or `"Bartesian 2025 unit sales projection"`.

2.  **Evaluate the Progress of Supply Chain Diversification:**
    *   Management's goal is to stabilize margins by shifting production out of China, with benefits expected by 2026. Determine the current percentage of product sourcing outside of China in 2025 to measure tangible progress against this critical headwind.
    *   *Search Focus:* Search for specific data like `"Hamilton Beach Brands sourcing percentage outside China 2025"` or `"HBB manufacturing move Vietnam"`.

3.  **Validate the Retailer Inventory Normalization Thesis (Walmart/Amazon):**
    *   The near-term recovery depends on major customers resuming normal inventory purchases. Search for recent (Q3 2025) earnings call commentary or press releases from Walmart or Amazon that specifically mention trends, sell-through, or inventory levels in the *small appliance* category to confirm or deny a return to normal buying patterns.
    *   *Search Focus:* Search for transcripts/press releases from major retailers: `"Walmart Q3 2025 small appliance inventory"`, `"Amazon Q3 2025 home goods inventory commentary"`.

4.  **Analyze Current Valuation vs. Historical/Peer Multiples:**
    *   The initial search provided a TTM P/E of around 6.1x and an EV/EBITDA of around 6.9x, which are both significantly below peer and industry averages, suggesting the stock is potentially cheap *if* the earnings can be sustained. Research the average P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples for the **US Household Appliance Industry** to quantify the size of the *value gap* and test the bull case claim that the stock is "deeply undervalued."
    *   *Search Focus:* Search for industry averages: `"US Consumer Durables Industry average P/E EV/EBITDA"`.

5.  **Assess the Impact of the Dual-Class Stock Structure on Investor Influence:**
    *   The company's extended founding family controls a disproportionate amount of the voting power, holding over 76% of the total voting power as of December 31, 2022, primarily through Class B shares (10 votes per share). This structure creates a significant governance risk for minority Class A shareholders. Research any historical minority shareholder actions or proposed changes to the dual-class structure to understand if this risk has been realized or is a viable future concern.
    *   *Search Focus:* Search for `"Hamilton Beach Brands dual-class stock shareholder dissent"` or `"NACCO family voting control HBB"`.
