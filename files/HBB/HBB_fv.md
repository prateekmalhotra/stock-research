## 2. Business Engine and Conservative Future Assumptions

Hamilton Beach Brands is a mature consumer appliance company with a significant footprint in the "good" and "better" consumer segments, actively expanding into "premium" and a new "Health" segment.

### Business Engine Components:

1.  **Core Consumer Appliance Market (Mature):** The core market for small kitchen appliances is mature and expected to be "modestly below 2023" in 2024. Revenue in this segment is driven by replacement cycles, marketing, and retailer placements.
2.  **Strategic Initiatives / Premiumization (Growth Driver):** The company is focused on delivering "above-market revenue performance" through premium brands, licensed products (e.g., Bartesian, Brita Hub, Clorox), and expanding commercial sales. This drives both revenue and gross margin expansion.
3.  **Digital/E-commerce (Growth/Margin Driver):** E-commerce is a strong channel, accounting for **40% of U.S. consumer sales**. Digital channels often have higher margins due to a direct-to-consumer component.
4.  **Hamilton Beach Health (New Growth/Profit Driver):** The acquisition of HealthBeacon in 2024 marks a new segment for home healthcare management. It is expected to transition from an operating loss in 2024 to **contributing to operating profit in 2025**.

### Revenue Projection Justification

Given the mature core business and the company's reliance on strategic, high-growth initiatives, a conservative approach is to project a modest, compounding growth rate that decelerates as the new segments mature. The 2024 baseline of \$654.693M is used as the starting point.

| Year | Growth Assumption | Rationale (Conservative) | Projected Revenue (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **4.0%** | Driven by the first full year of HealthBeacon contribution to operating profit and continued traction from premium/licensed brands (Bartesian, Brita Hub) and e-commerce growth. | **\$680.88** |
| **2026** | **3.0%** | Growth continues from new initiatives, but the core mature market acts as a drag, moderating the overall growth rate. | **\$701.31** |
| **2027** | **2.5%** | As new product lines and the Health segment normalize, the growth rate approaches a sustainable mature rate. | **\$718.84** |
| **2028** | **2.0%** | A stable, modest growth rate for a mature consumer goods company that is maintaining its competitive position through innovation. | **\$733.22** |
| **2029** | **1.5%** | Further conservatism, assuming market saturation and competitive pressure increase. | **\$744.22** |
| **2030** | **1.0%** | The near-term maturity rate. | **\$751.66** |

### Margin Projection Justification

Gross Margin and Net Income Margin are crucial. Management commentary highlights a trend of **Gross Margin expansion** due to favorable product mix (premium/Health) and lower product costs.

| Margin | Assumption | Rationale (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | **4.5%** | Management guides for a "significant increase in operating profit" compared to 2023. 2023 Net Margin was 4.03%. A conservative but significant increase to 4.5% is reasonable. |
| **2025** | **5.0%** | HealthBeacon is expected to contribute to operating profit in 2025, and continued premium/e-commerce mix shift will drive net margin closer to 5.0%. |
| **2026-2030** | **5.0%** | Holding the Net Income Margin constant at 5.0%. This is a conservative assumption, as it suggests the company is done realizing margin improvements from its strategic initiatives after 2025. |

## 3. Projected Cash Flow (Net Income and ROIC)

The valuation model assumes Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
*   **FY 2023 ROIC (Historical):**
    *   Net Income: \$25.2 M
    *   Invested Capital (Debt + Equity): \$50.0M (Debt) + \$147.267M (Equity, Dec 31, 2023 from 10-K in Step 2) = \$197.267 M
    *   **ROIC 2023 = 12.77%** (\$25.2M / \$197.267M)
*   **ROIC Assumption for Projection:** A conservative, reasonable ROIC of **10.0%** will be used for the projection period. This is below the company's strong 2023 performance, reflecting a conservative outlook on capital efficiency.

### Projected Net Income Calculation (in Millions)

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income Before ROIC (\$M) | Prior Year Cash (NI) (\$M) | ROIC (10.0%) (\$M) | Total Net Income (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$654.69 | 4.5% | **\$29.46** | *N/A* | *N/A* | **\$29.46** |
| **2025** | \$680.88 | 5.0% | \$34.04 | \$29.46 | \$2.95 | **\$36.99** |
| **2026** | \$701.31 | 5.0% | \$35.07 | \$36.99 | \$3.70 | **\$38.77** |
| **2027** | \$718.84 | 5.0% | \$35.94 | \$38.77 | \$3.88 | **\$39.82** |
| **2028** | \$733.22 | 5.0% | \$36.66 | \$39.82 | \$3.98 | **\$40.64** |
| **2029** | \$744.22 | 5.0% | \$37.21 | \$40.64 | \$4.06 | **\$41.27** |
| **2030** | \$751.66 | 5.0% | \$37.58 | \$41.27 | \$4.13 | **\$41.71** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### Discount Rate and Maturity Rate

| Metric | Assumption | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate** (Terminal Growth) | **2.0%** | For a mature consumer goods company, this rate is conservative. It assumes the company will grow slightly faster than long-term inflation, supported by the premium/Health segments. (Higher than the 1.0% final growth rate in the model to reflect long-term inflation + slight real growth). |
| **Conservative Discount Rate** (WACC Proxy) | **10.0%** | A reasonable and conservative discount rate for a low-Beta consumer appliance company. A higher rate is used to err on the side of caution. |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) (\$M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$36.99 | 0.909 | \$33.62 |
| **2026** | \$38.77 | 0.826 | \$32.03 |
| **2027** | \$39.82 | 0.751 | \$29.90 |
| **2028** | \$40.64 | 0.683 | \$27.76 |
| **2029** | \$41.27 | 0.621 | \$25.63 |
| **2030** | \$41.71 | 0.564 | \$23.51 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **\$172.45** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value is the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   Terminal Value (TV) = [Cash Flow in 2030 * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV = [\$41.71 M * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = \$42.54 M / 0.08 = \$531.75 M
*   **NPV of Terminal Value** = TV * Discount Factor (2030)
*   NPV of TV = \$531.75 M * 0.564 = **\$299.98 M**

### Total Equity Value

| Metric | Value (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of NPV (2025-2030) | \$172.45 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | \$299.98 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **\$472.43** |
| Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (C) | +\$22.60 |
| Less: Total Debt (D) | -\$50.00 |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **\$445.03** |

## 5. Fair Value Per Share and Justification

*   **Fair Value Per Share** = Total Fair Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value Per Share = \$445.03 M / 14.056 M shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share = \$31.66**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$31.66** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$13.78** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$31.66** is significantly higher than the Current Market Price of **\$13.78**. The market is making considerably different, more pessimistic assumptions about HBB's future.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions (Why the stock is cheap):**

1.  **Discount Rate is Much Higher:** The market is likely pricing in a higher risk, thus using a much higher discount rate (e.g., a 15-20% discount rate would be needed to bring the Fair Value closer to the current price). This reflects concern over trade tariffs, which caused HBB to suspend guidance, economic uncertainty impacting consumer spending, and the high concentration of sales in the mature core market.
2.  **Failure of Strategic Initiatives:** The market is skeptical that the new initiatives (HealthBeacon, Bartesian, premium brands) will deliver the projected margin and revenue growth. The market implicitly assumes the new Health segment will not achieve profitability and the core business's secular decline will overshadow any niche growth.
3.  **No ROIC Component:** The market may not be rewarding HBB for its capital efficiency, assuming all net income is required for maintenance and is not truly "free" cash flow that generates future income (i.e., a very low or 0% ROIC is priced in).

**Valuation's Assumptions (Why the Fair Value is higher):**

1.  **Successful Strategic Shift:** The model takes management's commentary as truth, assuming:
    *   **HealthBeacon** successfully pivots to profitability in 2025.
    *   **Margin Expansion** from the premium mix continues and stabilizes at 5.0% net margin, driven by new licensed products and e-commerce.
    *   The conservative **10.0% ROIC** (still lower than 2023 performance) is achievable due to a disciplined capital allocation strategy (as evidenced by debt reduction and share repurchases).

The discrepancy suggests the market has a **"show me" mentality**. HBB must execute on its strategic initiatives, particularly proving that HealthBeacon is a viable, profitable new segment, and that premiumization can consistently overcome core market maturity and trade-related risks before it awards the higher valuation. The DCF suggests there is a **significant margin of safety** if management can deliver on its stated goals and historical capital efficiency.
