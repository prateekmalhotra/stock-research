### **2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The core of Mattel's valuation rests on its multi-year strategy to transform from a toy manufacturer to an **IP-driven entertainment company**. The business engine is powered by leveraging its vast portfolio of intellectual property (IP) like *Barbie*, *Hot Wheels*, and *Fisher-Price* across film, television, digital, and live experiences, creating new revenue streams beyond just physical toy sales.

*   **2025 Revenue Estimate (Management Guidance):**
    *   Base 2024 Net Sales: \$5,380 million
    *   2025 Growth Rate: 2.0% (Midpoint of constant currency guidance)
    *   **2025 Net Sales:** \$5,380 million * (1 + 0.02) = **\$5,487.6 million**

*   **Revenue Growth Assumptions (2026 - 2030):**
    *   **2026 - 2027 (Post-Cost Savings & IP Ramp-Up):** The company has a "Optimizing for Profitable Growth" program targeting \$200 million in savings by the end of 2026, with \$148 million achieved by Q3 2025. This, combined with the momentum from the IP expansion (new films, digital platforms like Roblox) and the recovery from US retailer order shifts, should drive higher growth. A growth rate of **3.5%** is a conservative assumption, reflecting an acceleration beyond the base guidance but acknowledging industry cyclicality.
    *   **2028 - 2030 (Long-Term Maturation):** As the IP strategy matures, growth is expected to moderate. A gradual slowdown to a long-term growth rate is assumed, reflecting a competitive market. **3.0%** in 2028, **2.5%** in 2029, and **2.5%** in 2030 are used, reflecting a conservative transition to a maturity rate.

| Year | Net Sales (Millions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$5,380.0 | - | Base year |
| **2025 (Projected)** | **\$5,487.6** | 2.0% | Midpoint of Management's Net Sales Guidance |
| **2026 (Projected)** | **\$5,680.7** | 3.5% | IP-driven strategy gaining full momentum; realization of \$200M in cost savings |
| **2027 (Projected)** | **\$5,879.5** | 3.5% | Sustained benefit from IP expansion (film/digital) and stronger international growth |
| **2028 (Projected)** | **\$6,056.9** | 3.0% | Growth moderates as the initial IP-driven uplift stabilizes |
| **2029 (Projected)** | **\$6,208.3** | 2.5% | Conservative slow-down toward terminal growth |
| **2030 (Projected)** | **\$6,363.5** | 2.5% | Conservative slow-down toward terminal growth |

### **3. Margin and Net Income Projections**

The valuation will use **Adjusted Operating Income** to derive Net Income, as management has guided specifically to this metric and expects it to be a more comprehensive measure of profit.

*   **Gross Margin:** Use management's 2025 Adjusted Gross Margin guidance of **50.9%** for all years, reflecting cost savings efforts.
*   **Operating Margin (OPEX/SG&A):**
    *   2025 Adjusted Operating Income (Midpoint): \$725 million (Midpoint of \$700M to \$750M)
    *   2025 Projected Operating Margin: \$725 million / \$5,487.6 million = **13.2%**
    *   This margin is used for all years, assuming the gross margin expansion is offset by increased investments in digital/entertainment IP development (SG&A).
*   **Tax Rate:** Use management's 2025 Adjusted Tax Rate guidance of **23.5%** (Midpoint of 23%-24%).

#### **Net Income Calculation:**
Net Income = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate)

| Year | Net Sales (A) | Adj. Operating Margin | Adj. Operating Income (B) = A * C | Tax Rate | Net Income (C) = B * (1 - Tax Rate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$5,487.6 | 13.2% | **\$725.0** | 23.5% | **\$555.6** |
| **2026** | \$5,680.7 | 13.2% | **\$750.3** | 23.5% | **\$574.0** |
| **2027** | \$5,879.5 | 13.2% | **\$776.1** | 23.5% | **\$593.5** |
| **2028** | \$6,056.9 | 13.2% | **\$799.5** | 23.5% | **\$611.6** |
| **2029** | \$6,208.3 | 13.2% | **\$819.3** | 23.5% | **\$626.7** |
| **2030** | \$6,363.5 | 13.2% | **\$839.7** | 23.5% | **\$642.3** |

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**

The instruction requires a unique cash flow model where net income from the prior year generates additional income through ROIC. The model assumes **Net Income = Free Cash Flow** (FCF) for simplicity and conservatism, as management guidance for 2025 FCF is approximately \$500M, which is close to the projected Net Income of \$555.6M.

*   **Conservative ROIC:** The historical average ROIC is 10.6%. For a conservative estimate, we use **10.0%**.
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative Hurdle Rate):** **10.0%** (a high WACC proxy for a public, non-cyclical company).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** **2.0%** (below long-term nominal global GDP).

#### **Future Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation**

FCF for Year *n* = Net Income from Year *n* + (Cash from Year *n-1* * ROIC)

*The instruction is implemented by assuming "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."*

| Year | Net Income (A) | Cash from Previous Year (B) | ROIC (10.0%) * B | Total FCF (C) = A + D | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **\$555.6** | **\$692.0** (Initial Cash) | \$69.2 | **\$624.8** | 0.9091 | **\$568.0** |
| **2026** | **\$574.0** | \$1,217.6 | \$121.8 | **\$695.8** | 0.8264 | **\$574.8** |
| **2027** | **\$593.5** | \$1,893.4 | \$189.3 | **\$782.8** | 0.7513 | **\$588.1** |
| **2028** | **\$611.6** | \$2,676.2 | \$267.6 | **\$879.2** | 0.6830 | **\$600.4** |
| **2029** | **\$626.7** | \$3,555.4 | \$355.5 | **\$982.2** | 0.6209 | **\$609.9** |
| **2030** | **\$642.3** | \$4,537.6 | \$453.8 | **\$1,096.1** | 0.5645 | **\$618.3** |
| **Sum of Projected FCF NPV** | | | | | | **\$3,559.5** |
| **Cash Carry-Forward (End of 2030)** | | \$5,633.7 | | | | |

*Note on Cash Carry-Forward:* Cash is calculated as: $B_{n} = B_{n-1} + C_{n-1}$. For 2026 Cash: $692.0 + 525.6 = 1217.6$ (where $\$525.6$ is the initial Net Income from 2025 without the ROIC boost, to avoid double counting the $C_n$). However, to follow the *explicit* rule: "Assume that net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year," the cash balance simply accumulates the net income.
*Cash $n$ = Cash $n-1$ + Net Income $n-1$.
*   Cash 2025 (Initial) = **\$692.0**
*   Cash 2026 = $692.0 + 555.6 = **\$1,247.6**
*   Cash 2027 = $1,247.6 + 574.0 = **\$1,821.6**
*   Cash 2028 = $1,821.6 + 593.5 = **\$2,415.1**
*   Cash 2029 = $2,415.1 + 611.6 = **\$3,026.7**
*   Cash 2030 = $3,026.7 + 626.7 = **\$3,653.4**

**Revised FCF based on the explicit rule:**

| Year | Net Income (A) | Cash from Previous Year (B) | ROIC (10.0%) * B (D) | Total FCF (C) = A + D | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **\$555.6** | \$692.0 (Initial Cash) | \$69.2 | **\$624.8** | 0.9091 | **\$568.0** |
| **2026** | **\$574.0** | \$1,247.6 | \$124.8 | **\$698.8** | 0.8264 | **\$577.6** |
| **2027** | **\$593.5** | \$1,821.6 | \$182.2 | **\$775.7** | 0.7513 | **\$582.8** |
| **2028** | **\$611.6** | \$2,415.1 | \$241.5 | **\$853.1** | 0.6830 | **\$582.6** |
| **2029** | **\$626.7** | \$3,026.7 | \$302.7 | **\$929.4** | 0.6209 | **\$577.1** |
| **2030** | **\$642.3** | \$3,653.4 | \$365.3 | **\$1,007.6** | 0.5645 | **\$568.8** |
| **Sum of Projected FCF NPV** | | | | | | **\$3,456.9** |

#### **Terminal Value (TV)**

The terminal value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model on the final cash flow projection.

*   Terminal FCF in 2030 = \$1,007.6 million
*   Terminal Growth Rate ($g$): 2.0%
*   Discount Rate ($r$): 10.0%
*   Terminal Value (2030) = $\frac{\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{\$1,007.6 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \$12,847.05 \text{ million}$

#### **Net Present Value of Terminal Value**

*   NPV of TV = $\text{TV}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$12,847.05 \text{ million} \times 0.5645 = \$7,251.7 \text{ million}$

#### **Total Equity Value**

*   **Total Enterprise Value** = NPV of Projected FCF + NPV of Terminal Value
    *   Total Enterprise Value = \$3,456.9 million + \$7,251.7 million = **\$10,708.6 million**

---

### **5. Fair Value Calculation**

Fair Value = (Total Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents) / Shares Outstanding

*   Total Enterprise Value (From DCF) = **\$10,708.6 million**
*   Total Debt (Q3 2025) = **\$2,340 million**
*   Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (Q3 2025) = **\$692 million**
*   Shares Outstanding (October 2025) = **323.5 million**

1.  **Equity Value:** \$10,708.6 million - \$2,340 million + \$692 million = **\$9,060.6 million**
2.  **Fair Value Per Share:** \$9,060.6 million / 323.5 million shares = **\$28.01**

---

### **6. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: \$28.01**

**Current Market Price: \$18.42**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$28.01** is approximately **52% higher** than the Current Market Price of **\$18.42**.

#### **Justification for the Discrepancy (Model vs. Market)**

The significant difference suggests the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Mattel's future than the model, particularly regarding the **success of the IP-driven entertainment strategy** and the **long-term growth rate**.

| Model Assumption | Market's Implied Assumption | Justification for Model's View |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Growth Rate (2026-2030):** 3.5% down to 2.5% | Near 0% growth after 2025 (or high risk/cyclicality) | Management is actively pursuing a multi-year strategy to monetize IP across media, which has historically been a high-margin growth driver for entertainment companies. *Hot Wheels* and *Action Figures* are showing strong growth. The model assumes the strategy succeeds and Mattel transforms into a more diversified IP entity. |
| **Discount Rate ($r$):** 10.0% | Higher Cost of Capital (Implied >12%) | The market likely assigns a higher risk premium due to the company's historical volatility, the high working capital intensity of the toy industry, and the recent negative impact of retailer ordering shifts. |
| **ROIC (Reinvestment Efficiency):** 10.0% | Lower or Near-Zero ROIC | The market is skeptical that Mattel can reinvest its cash flow at a consistent and high rate of return. The model, however, uses the company's own historical average ROIC of 10.6%, suggesting the core business can generate strong returns on invested capital. |

**Model's Case:** The valuation makes a strong case that the market is excessively pessimistic, failing to fully price in the successful execution of Mattel's transformation strategy. By achieving the mid-point of its 2025 guidance and continuing to execute its cost-savings program (\$200 million target by 2026), the company has demonstrated operational excellence and the ability to expand margins. If the IP strategy (new films, TV, digital expansion) delivers on its promise of new, high-margin revenue streams, the projected growth rates and the resulting fair value of **\$28.01** would be attainable. The market is effectively pricing Mattel as a company with no successful IP monetization and minimal long-term growth.
