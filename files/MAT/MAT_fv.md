## Mattel, Inc. (MAT) Stock Valuation

### I. Financial Starting Data (As of December 31, 2025)

The following financial data is sourced from Mattel, Inc.'s most recent SEC filings and earnings reports, primarily the Q4 and Full Year 2025 results.

| Financial Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$1,240** | Stated as $1.24 billion in the Q4 2025 earnings summary. |
| **Total Debt** | **$2,331.7** | Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2025. |
| **Net Sales (2025)** | **$5,348** | Full-year 2025 Net Sales. |
| **Net Income (2025)** | **$397.6** | Full-year 2025 Net Income. |
| **Stockholders' Equity (2025)** | **$2,233.0** | Stockholders' Equity as of December 31, 2025. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **310.8** (millions) | Shares outstanding as of October 17, 2025 (Q3 2025 10-Q base). |

### II. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation

The ROIC is used to calculate the non-operating income derived from the retained cash flow (Net Income reinvested as cash) in the following year.

1.  **Invested Capital (IC) Calculation (2025):**
    Invested Capital = Total Debt + Stockholders' Equity
    IC = $2,331.7 + $2,233.0 = **$4,564.7 million**

2.  **Historical ROIC Calculation (2025):**
    Net Income (2025) = $397.6 million.
    Historical ROIC % = Net Income / Invested Capital
    Historical ROIC % = $397.6 / $4,564.7 = **8.71%**

3.  **Conservative Forward ROIC Assumption:**
    A conservative, reasonable ROIC of **4.0%** will be used for future projections. This is significantly lower than the 2025 historical rate of 8.71% to build a conservative model, reflecting potential cyclical downturns in the toy industry and the risk associated with new strategic investments (such as the Mattel163 acquisition and IP development) which may not yield immediate returns.

### III. Business Engine & Revenue/Net Income Projection (2026-2030)

Mattel's business engine is driven by its strategy to transform into an **"IP-driven play and family entertainment business"** (the 'Mattel Films' and licensing strategy) and the strength of its Power Brands (Barbie, Hot Wheels). The key drivers are:

1.  **IP Monetization:** Converting owned brands into film/TV content, which drives toy sales and licensing revenue. This is a multi-year effort, as evidenced by the new Disney Princess/Frozen licensing and the Mattel163 mobile games studio acquisition.
2.  **Margin Expansion:** Continuation of the "Optimizing for Profitable Growth" cost savings program, which has a target of $225 million in total savings by 2026.

#### Revenue Growth Assumptions:

*   **2026 (Management Guidance):** Management projects 3% to 6% constant currency Net Sales growth plus an estimated 1.5 percentage point FX tailwind.
    *   **Conservative Assumption:** I will use the low end of guidance: $5,348 \* (1 + 0.03 + 0.015) = **$5,588 million** (4.5% reported growth).
*   **2027 - 2030 (IP/Film/Brand-Driven Growth):** The Mattel Films slate (including Barbie momentum, Hot Wheels, etc.) is a medium-term driver, coupled with full-year contribution from the Mattel163 acquisition. However, the toy industry is cyclical. I will use a **conservative, declining growth rate** to reflect a peak in the IP cycle and then normalization.
    *   **2027:** 4.0% (Strong IP momentum, full effect of 2026 strategic investments)
    *   **2028:** 3.0% (Mid-cycle growth, ongoing core brand strength)
    *   **2029:** 2.5% (Normalization)
    *   **2030:** 2.0% (Conservative long-term growth)

#### Margin Assumptions:

*   **2026 Net Income Margin (Management Guidance):** Management guided for Adjusted Operating Income (AOI) of $550-$600 million on ~$5,588 million in sales. I will use the midpoint of $575 million. The 2025 Reported Net Income Margin was $397.6 / $5,348 = 7.43%. Considering the $150 million headwind from strategic investments in 2026, the $575M AOI is a good proxy for core profitability before non-operating items. I will conservatively estimate the 2026 Net Income Margin at **7.5%**, just slightly above the 2025 reported margin.
*   **2027 - 2030 Net Income Margin (Conservative Improvement):** The $190 million strategic investments in 2026 are intended to accelerate future top and bottom-line growth in 2027 and beyond. The cost-savings program is also expected to continue yielding benefits. I will project a slow, conservative margin expansion as the IP-strategy matures and operational efficiencies take hold.
    *   **2027:** 8.0%
    *   **2028:** 8.5%
    *   **2029:** 9.0%
    *   **2030:** 9.5%

#### Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) Table:

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions) | Revenue Growth Rate | Net Income Margin % | Net Income from Operations (A) (Millions) | ROIC Income (B) (Millions) | Projected Net Income (A+B) (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)**| $5,348.0 | N/A | 7.43% | $397.6 | N/A | $397.6 |
| **2026** | $5,588.0 | 4.5% | 7.5% | $419.1 | $15.90 | $435.0 |
| **2027** | $5,811.5 | 4.0% | 8.0% | $464.9 | $17.40 | $482.3 |
| **2028** | $5,985.8 | 3.0% | 8.5% | $508.8 | $19.30 | $528.1 |
| **2029** | $6,135.4 | 2.5% | 9.0% | $552.2 | $21.10 | $573.3 |
| **2030** | $6,258.1 | 2.0% | 9.5% | $594.5 | $22.90 | $617.4 |

**Justification for ROIC Income (B):**
*   Net Income for the next year = Net Income from Operations + (Net Income from Previous Year * ROIC %).
*   Example 2026 ROIC Income: $397.6 (2025 Net Income) * 4.0% = **$15.90 million**.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

#### A. Rate Assumptions

| Rate Type | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative-but-reasonable discount rate. Reflects the cost of equity for a turnaround-in-progress, cyclical toy company with debt on its balance sheet, sitting above the market average but below high-risk equity. |
| **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate)** | **1.5%** | A very conservative rate below long-term global inflation and US GDP growth, reflecting the mature and cyclical nature of the toy industry, despite the IP growth strategy. |

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Income is treated as the projected Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the DCF model, following the instruction that "net income for each year goes straight into cash."

| Year | Projected Net Income (Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $435.0 | 0.9174 | $399.0 |
| **2027** | $482.3 | 0.8417 | $405.9 |
| **2028** | $528.1 | 0.7722 | $407.8 |
| **2029** | $573.3 | 0.7084 | $406.0 |
| **2030** | $617.4 | 0.6499 | $401.3 |
| **Total NPV of 2026-2030 Cash Flows** | | | **$2,020.0** |

#### C. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value is calculated as the Perpetuity Value (PV) of the 2030 cash flow, discounted back to the present.

1.  **Terminal Value in 2030:**
    TV 2030 = (Projected Net Income 2030 \* (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    TV 2030 = ($617.4 \* (1 + 0.015)) / (0.090 - 0.015)
    TV 2030 = $626.66 / 0.075 = **$8,355.5 million**

2.  **Terminal Value NPV:**
    TV NPV = TV 2030 \* Discount Factor (2030)
    TV NPV = $8,355.5 \* 0.6499 = **$5,430.2 million**

#### D. Total Net Present Value (NPV)

Total NPV = NPV of 2026-2030 Cash Flows + Terminal Value NPV
Total NPV = $2,020.0 + $5,430.2 = **$7,450.2 million**

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $7,450.2 |
| **Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,240.0 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | ($2,331.7) |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$6,358.5** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 310.8 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$20.46** |

### Fair Value of Mattel, Inc. (MAT) Stock

**The calculated Fair Value Per Share for Mattel, Inc. is $20.46.**

### Market Comparison and Justification

*   **Current Stock Price (Hypothetical):** Let's assume the current market price is approximately **$21.50** (to compare with market sentiment near the search dates).

#### Justification for the Fair Value ($20.46) vs. Market Price ($21.50)

My calculated Fair Value of **$20.46** is slightly lower than the assumed market price of $21.50, suggesting the market is slightly more optimistic than my conservative model.

**Why the difference?**

My model is based on highly conservative assumptions, in line with the established rules:

1.  **Conservative Revenue Growth:** I assumed the low-end of 2026 guidance (4.5% reported) and a quickly declining growth rate down to 2.0% by 2030. The market's slightly higher valuation implies it may be factoring in **higher, more sustainable mid-cycle growth**, perhaps closer to the 5-6% range for a longer period, believing the IP-driven strategy (Mattel Films) will generate a more consistent stream of "Barbie-like" franchise hits.
2.  **Conservative ROIC/Margin:** I used a low ROIC of **4.0%**, significantly below the 2025 calculated 8.71%. The market is likely modeling a faster and higher realization of the **$150 million strategic investments**, leading to higher net income margins in 2027-2030 (e.g., margins peaking at 11-12% instead of my conservative 9.5%).
3.  **Conservative Discount Rate:** My **9.0%** discount rate is a healthy assumption for a cyclical turnaround company. The market's current valuation suggests it may be using a slightly lower WACC, perhaps 8.0%-8.5%, indicating a **lower perceived risk** now that the company has proven its IP monetization model with the success of the Barbie film.

In summary, my valuation provides a solid floor, indicating that the market's price is **justified** based on a slightly more optimistic (but not unreasonable) view of Mattel's long-term ability to leverage its IP portfolio, drive operating efficiencies, and accelerate the growth of its Mattel Films pipeline. The market is giving more credit to the long-term impact of the strategic shift than my ultra-conservative model allows.
