## Business Summary

Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX) operates electronic financial marketplaces, acting as a digital meeting place where professional financial institutions—such as large brokerage houses, banks, and specialized trading firms, primarily located in the United States—come together to execute trades, mainly in stock options and corporate shares. The business operates a B2B model, where its customers pay for high-speed access to the exchange and for the execution of trades. MIAX generates the majority of its revenue from two core sources: collecting small transaction fees for every trade successfully completed on its platforms, which scales directly with overall market activity, and earning recurring fees for providing necessary high-speed electronic connectivity and valuable real-time market data to its professional users.

## Business Model Risk

The most immediate risk is the high dependence on overall trading volumes and market volatility; if the financial markets enter a quiet period or a recession, fewer trades occur, directly reducing the transaction fees MIAX collects. This cyclical threat has historically impacted exchange earnings during periods of low investor enthusiasm. A major ongoing risk is intense competition from larger, established exchange operators (like NASDAQ and NYSE). These rivals constantly battle for market share by offering faster technology or adjusting pricing, threatening MIAX’s competitive position and ability to maintain pricing power. Long-term risks center heavily on technology and regulation. As an all-electronic market, MIAX is constantly vulnerable to system failures, technical glitches, or cyberattacks. Past trading outages at various exchanges have demonstrated that such events can immediately halt trading, cause reputational damage, and lead to massive regulatory fines. Furthermore, changes implemented by government regulators, such as caps on transaction fees or new rules concerning how market data must be distributed, could instantaneously and severely disrupt MIAX’s revenue streams and business model.

## Company History

This is the history of Miami International Holdings, Inc., the company that operates the MIAX Exchange Group.

### **The Inception and Founding Rationale (Why MIAX was Created)**

1.  **Founding the Company:** Miami International Holdings (MIH), despite its name, was actually formed in **2007** and is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.
2.  **The Core Goal (The "Why"):** The company was founded with the aim of building a new, sophisticated financial exchange group powered by its own proprietary (in-house built) **technology**.
3.  **Entering the Market:** MIH's first major move was launching the **Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX Options)** in **2012** after getting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
4.  **Initial Focus:** The initial and primary focus was on the highly competitive U.S. **options market**, which involves the trading of contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset.

***

### **Innovative Solutions and Growth Strategy**

1.  **Proprietary High-Speed Technology:** The most critical tool MIAX used to compete with giants like the NYSE and Nasdaq was its proprietary, **low-latency trading technology**. This means its systems are custom-built to be extremely fast and efficient, which is vital for high-volume traders.
2.  **The Multi-Exchange Approach:** Instead of just one exchange, MIAX created a group of separate options exchanges (like MIAX Options, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Sapphire).
3.  **Different Rule Sets for Different Traders:** Each of its options exchanges uses a different set of rules and pricing models, such as **Maker-Taker** or **Price-Time** priority. This innovative approach allows MIAX to attract a broader range of trading strategies and capture more overall trading volume in the market.
4.  **Strategic Partnership and Capital:** The company created an **Equity Rights Program** where they offered a stake in the company to their largest and most important trading customers in exchange for an early cash investment. This aligned the interests of the exchange with its biggest users and helped fund its expansion.
5.  **Diversification through Acquisitions:** MIAX systematically expanded beyond just options by acquiring and integrating other businesses:
    *   **Futures Market:** Acquired the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (now MIAX Futures) and Dorman Trading, giving them access to the futures market and clearing house services.
    *   **Digital Assets (Crypto):** Acquired LedgerX, a regulated platform for trading Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives, providing a foothold in the growing digital asset space.
    *   **International Reach:** Acquired majority stakes in the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) and The International Stock Exchange (TISE) to expand its footprint globally.

***

### **The Road to Today (Major Headwinds and Tailwinds)**

#### **Headwinds (Challenges) They Faced**

1.  **Competition from Established Giants:** From the start, MIAX had to break into a business dominated by a few very large, established players (Nasdaq, NYSE, Cboe), making it a significant uphill battle for market share.
2.  **Patent Lawsuit:** In a notable legal challenge, a major competitor, Nasdaq, brought a patent infringement claim against MIAX. This type of legal battle can be costly and disruptive, but the court ultimately dismissed the claim in 2022.
3.  **Financial Vulnerabilities:** In the years leading up to its public offering, MIAX experienced a period of inconsistent profitability and relied on a small number of large partners for a notable share of its trading volume, creating a concentration risk.
4.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a financial exchange, MIAX constantly faces heightened regulatory scrutiny and the growing threat of cybersecurity risks, which requires continuous and expensive investment.

#### **Tailwinds (Favorable Market Conditions) They Leveraged**

1.  **Surge in Options Trading:** The company benefited from a multi-year, positive trend in the financial industry that saw a massive surge in overall options trading volume, often fueled by market volatility.
2.  **Investor Appetite for Exchanges:** The market showed heightened interest in exchange operators, which was a significant tailwind leading up to their **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** in **August 2025** on the NYSE.
3.  **Global Expansion Focus:** Leveraging the shift towards globalized trading, the acquisitions of international exchanges in Bermuda and the Channel Islands helped them build a more diverse and resilient revenue stream.
4.  **Return to the Physical Floor:** In a surprising move that captured attention, MIAX launched its newest exchange, MIAX Sapphire, with a modern **physical trading floor** in Miami in **September 2025**. This differentiation creates buzz and caters to specific trading needs that remain physical.

***

### **Present Day and The Company's Goal**

1.  **Current Status:** MIAX is now a global exchange group, operating nine distinct exchanges across options, equities (stocks), futures, and international markets.
2.  **Market Position:** As of the first half of 2025, MIAX had become the **fourth-largest options operator** in the U.S. and a major player in the global derivatives market.
3.  **The Overarching Goal:** The goal is to continue growing by leveraging its proprietary technology to offer diverse, reliable, and high-performance financial marketplaces across multiple asset classes and geographies, positioning itself as a technology-driven disruptor in the financial exchange world.

## Moat Analysis

Based on an analysis of its core business and competitive landscape, here is an analysis of the moat of Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX).

### Moat and Differentiation of MIAX

MIAX operates in the highly competitive and fragmented financial exchange market, competing against giants like Cboe, NYSE, and Nasdaq. Its competitive advantage, or "moat," is primarily built on three pillars: proprietary technology, strategic product diversity, and regulatory compliance.

#### 1. Proprietary Low-Latency Technology
*   **In-House Speed:** MIAX built its core trading technology systems completely in-house, designed specifically for the rigorous demands of derivatives trading. This proprietary technology allows it to offer a consistent, ultra-low-latency (very fast) experience and exceptionally high reliability, with a reported uptime of nearly 100%.
*   **Competitive Edge:** This speed and reliability are crucial differentiators that attract High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms and professional market makers, which are essential for generating liquidity on an exchange.
*   **R&D and Innovation:** The company must constantly invest in its AI and digital infrastructure and innovate faster than its peers to maintain this technological edge. Therefore, continuous innovation acts as a core requirement to keep its moat strong.

#### 2. Differentiated and Flexible Pricing Power
*   **Targeted Pricing Models:** MIAX operates multiple options exchanges (Options, Pearl, Emerald, Sapphire), each employing different market structures and pricing models, such as "Maker-Taker" and "Taker-Maker," alongside various allocation methods (Price-Time vs. Pro-Rata).
*   **Strategic Positioning:** This layered approach allows MIAX to strategically target and attract different types of trading behavior and liquidity providers, giving them a unique form of pricing power to shape how participants interact on its various platforms.

#### 3. Network Effects and Customer Stickiness
*   **The Liquidity Loop:** Like all exchanges, MIAX benefits from a powerful network effect: more traders bring more liquidity (available buyers and sellers), and more liquidity, in turn, attracts even more traders. This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing loop that is difficult to break.
*   **Sticky Revenue:** The core of an exchange's revenue comes from transaction fees, market data feeds, and connectivity charges. These are ongoing, recurring revenues from customers who have deeply integrated the exchange's technology into their trading systems, making the contracts inherently sticky and the business reliable once liquidity is established.

#### 4. Barriers to Displacement and Growth Strategy
*   **Displacement Risk:** Displacement is difficult because of the combination of the regulatory hurdles (operating a regulated exchange is a high barrier to entry), the immense capital required to build a competitive, high-speed technology platform, and the challenge of overcoming the network effect of established exchanges to build liquidity from scratch. While a competitor with "more capital" could attempt it, the time and regulatory approvals needed mean displacement is not easy or fast.
*   **Reason for Growth:** MIAX grew into a significant market player (capturing around 16-17% of the U.S. options market) by using superior, in-house technology to successfully disrupt legacy players who often rely on older infrastructure.
*   **Strategic Expansion:** The company's moat is further strengthened by expanding beyond US options into equities, futures, and international markets (like the Bermuda Stock Exchange), diversifying its revenue streams and offering clients a multi-asset platform. This expansion into new asset classes (e.g., niche and proprietary index products) provides new revenue streams independent of competition in the main options market.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on the analysis of recent news, investor relations releases, and management commentary following the IPO, the catalysts for Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX) are focused on leveraging its proprietary technology to expand market share across multiple asset classes.

### Catalysts for Stock Price Increase

#### Near-Term Catalysts (Within the next 12 months)

1.  **Continued Options Market Share Growth:** The MIAX Exchange Group has recently achieved record market share in multi-listed options, reaching 16.7% in Q2 2025. Continued expansion of this market share will translate directly into higher trading revenue.
2.  **Ramping Up New Options Exchange (Sapphire):** The new MIAX Sapphire options exchange, which launched in late 2024 and opened a new trading floor in September 2025, is designed to capture another 6-10% of the US multi-listed floor volume. Its successful ramp-up and ability to attract new volume would be an immediate positive.
3.  **Futures Product Launch:** The company is scheduled to launch the trading of financial futures, including the new Bloomberg 500 Index (B500) and Bloomberg US 100 Price Return Index (B100Q) futures, on its MIAX Futures Onyx platform in February 2026. This is an immediate diversification and revenue opportunity.

#### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 months)

1.  **Futures Business Diversification and Expansion:** A core long-term strategy is to aggressively expand the nascent futures business by leveraging the proprietary technology and market relationships developed in options. This includes creating a full suite of products, such as a volatility product around the B500 and B100 futures, and utilizing the 10-year exclusive index licensing agreement with Bloomberg for broader product development.
2.  **International Growth and Market Access:** The acquisitions of The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) and The International Stock Exchange (TISE) provide MIAX with a platform for international growth and geographic diversification. This strategy opens up new markets for listing and trading various securities.
3.  **Proprietary Technology Advantage:** The company's in-house built, low-latency, and reliable trading technology is the fundamental advantage that is intended to keep customers on their exchanges. Continued investment in and differentiation of this technology is the long-term driver for attracting liquidity and gaining market share across all asset classes (options, equities, futures).

### Management's Explicit Strategy (CEO Thomas P. Gallagher)

*   **Technology as the Core Strategy:** CEO Thomas P. Gallagher stated that the company's edge is "first it's technology" and that while low or no fees initially got participants in the door, what is keeping them there is "the experience the technology is the differentiator."
*   **Leveraging Relationships for Futures Expansion:** Management’s strategy is to use the capital raised from the IPO to "leverage the technology, the people and the market relationships I’ve developed over the last 12 years and move those customer relationships from options to futures."
*   **New Revenue from New Products:** Mr. Gallagher is excited about launching a new suite of financial futures products, having signed a 10-year agreement with Bloomberg to launch indices like the B500 and eventually create related volatility products.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available public filings and disclosures regarding insider ownership and executive compensation, here is the analysis of the management incentive and compensation for Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX).

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensations for MIAX**

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors (Alignment Factor)**

1.  **Significant Insider Stake:** The total insider ownership in Miami International Holdings is substantial, approximately **17.15%** of the company's stock. A high level of insider ownership generally aligns management's personal wealth directly with the company's long-term stock performance.
2.  **CEO's Direct Ownership:** The Chairman and CEO, Thomas P. Gallagher, is a significant shareholder, directly owning approximately **3.07%** of the company's shares. This personal stake means that his financial returns are directly dependent on increases in the company's share value, strongly encouraging a focus on shareholder interests.

#### **Compensation Structure (Incentive Structure)**

3.  **High Reliance on Variable Pay:** The compensation for the CEO is heavily weighted towards performance-based incentives, with a composition of approximately **24% base salary and 76% in bonuses and equity awards** (company stock and options). This structure minimizes fixed costs and maximizes the financial impact of achieving company goals.
4.  **Focus on Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The company utilizes a formal compensation structure that includes Short-Term Incentive (STI) and Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans, with recent adoption of a 2025 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTIP). The use of equity awards like restricted stock units and performance shares/units in the LTIP is designed to reward sustained growth over multiple years, which is a key tenet of shareholder value creation.
5.  **Performance-Based Objectives:** The LTI and STI plans are explicitly designed to reward senior management for achieving **"organizational wide objectives (typically financial, operational or strategic in nature)"** as well as individual contributions. This connects executive pay to key business results, although the annual cash bonus is described as "discretionary."

#### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

6.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** The combined factors of significant insider ownership (17.15% total insider ownership and 3.07% CEO ownership) and an incentive-heavy compensation structure (76% of CEO pay is variable) create a strong incentive for management to act in the interest of the shareholders.
7.  **Incentive to Create Long-Term Value:** The heavy weighting of compensation toward long-term, equity-based awards (via the LTIP) rewards share price appreciation and sustained operational success, which are the primary drivers of long-term shareholder returns.
8.  **Limited Incentive for Self-Interest:** The relatively low proportion of fixed salary (24%) and the direct personal wealth tied up in company stock suggest that managers are **not** primarily incentivized to just "line their own pockets" through excessive fixed pay, but rather to grow the company's value.

## Price History

Based on a review of recent financial data and news, here is an analysis of Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX) stock price history and technical standing:

1.  **Price History and 52-Week Range:** The stock has experienced a significant uptrend, trading between a 52-week low of approximately **\$23.00** and a recent 52-week high of up to **\$43.83**. The stock was recently trading near its 52-week high, with a close price of \$42.09 (as of October 3, 2025) and a last trade on October 6, 2025, at \$43.61.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Based on a recent price of **\$43.61** and the 52-week low of **\$23.00**, the stock is currently trading approximately **89.61%** above its 52-week low. (Calculation: ($\frac{\$43.61 - \$23.00}{\$23.00}$) $\times$ 100% $\approx$ 89.61%).

3.  **Technical Analysis Assessment (Trading Low?):** Technical indicators suggest the stock is **not trading low** but is instead in a strong uptrend. Multiple technical signals from short-term and long-term Moving Averages are giving a "Strong Buy" or general "Buy" signal. The stock has risen 10.7% over a recent two-week period and is described as being in the middle of a "wide and strong rising trend" with expectations for a further rise.

4.  **Reason for Big Gains ("Up Bigly"):** The significant upward momentum is strongly linked to its **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** and robust performance in its core business. The stock surged by 37.6% on its first day of trading following its IPO in mid-August 2025.

5.  **Recent Bullish Catalysts:** In the last few months, the stock has been boosted by positive company news, including reporting **record options trading volume** in August 2025 and an announced strategic timeline to support the trading of financial futures. Additionally, the stock experienced a **7.07% surge** following announcements of strategic European market expansions and investments in AI and digital infrastructure.

6.  **Analyst Sentiment:** The stock currently holds an average analyst rating of **"Buy"** or **"Moderate Buy"** from analysts, though the average 12-month price target of \$40.60 suggests a slight downside from the current price, indicating it may be fully valued at the moment.

## Long Thesis

MIAX will experience strong, sustained growth because it is a technology-first financial market operator built to disrupt older, slower competitors. In the near term, the company will quickly grow its transaction fee revenue by capturing more market share in stock options trading and immediately launching new, exclusive financial futures products through its Bloomberg partnership. For the long term, MIAX will leverage its in-house, ultra-fast technology platform to diversify its business globally across options, futures, and international markets. This expansion will turn MIAX into a resilient, multi-asset trading powerhouse, generating reliable, high-margin, recurring revenue from transaction fees and data services, which is strongly aligned with its high insider ownership.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This growth thesis relies on the following factors: 1) MIAX must maintain its technological speed advantage over much larger competitors. 2) The financial markets must remain active and volatile, encouraging high trading volumes. 3) The newly launched futures market and the new options floor must quickly attract enough traders to become profitable. 4) Regulatory bodies must not introduce new rules that severely cap transaction fees or mandate changes to the high-speed data business model. 5) Management must successfully continue executing its strategy of integrating global acquisitions and launching new financial products.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes, weaknesses, and uncorroborated assumptions in the long thesis for Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX).

## Bear Case Critique of MIAX Long Thesis

### I. Flaws in the "Technology-First Disruption" and Competitive Advantage

1.  **The Technological Edge is Fading or Closing Fast:** The thesis hinges on MIAX being "technology-first" to disrupt "older, slower" competitors. However, major rivals like Cboe Global Markets are heavily investing, rolling out new trading platforms (e.g., "Titanium") globally and rapidly closing the latency gap. Cboe's **Dedicated Cores** service, for example, reduced latency on its US equities exchanges by **60%**, directly challenging MIAX's primary selling point of ultra-low latency technology.
2.  **The Scale and R&D Budget Disparity:** While MIAX's current latency metrics are competitive, much larger exchange groups (CME, Nasdaq, Cboe) possess significantly greater financial resources and scale. These competitors can deploy vast capital into continuous R&D and global infrastructure, making it difficult for MIAX to maintain a persistent, disruptive technology lead over the long term.

### II. Flaws in the "High-Margin, Reliable Revenue" and Financial Health Claims

1.  **Low Net Profitability Contradicts "High-Margin" Claim:** Despite a high average annual revenue growth rate and touted operational efficiency, the company has reported a very low net profit margin (0.14% in the last twelve months ending Q2 2025) and negative earnings growth (-97.9%) in the last year. This current lack of robust profitability directly contradicts the core thesis that the company will generate "reliable, high-margin, recurring revenue".
2.  **Regulatory Threat to High-Margin Data Revenue:** A significant portion of an exchange operator's high-margin revenue often comes from proprietary data services. The SEC has a history of scrutinizing and reviewing the fees charged for market information, posing an ongoing regulatory risk that new rules could be introduced to severely cap or alter this revenue stream, thereby eliminating the supposed "high-margin" stability.
3.  **Futures Launch is Delayed, Not "Immediate":** The thesis claims an "immediately launching" of new futures products via the Bloomberg partnership. The actual launch of the key **Bloomberg 500 Index futures** and options products on the MIAX Futures Onyx platform is planned for the **second half of 2025** (and financial futures on the Onyx platform are planned for **February 22, 2026**), which is not immediate and injects significant execution and regulatory timing risk into the near-term revenue growth projection.
4.  **Uphill Battle for Futures Liquidity:** Index futures are an extremely concentrated and illiquid market dominated by the CME Group's benchmark products (e.g., S\&P 500 futures). Attracting significant liquidity and market participants to a new, alternative product like the Bloomberg 500 Index futures, despite the Bloomberg brand, will be a difficult and expensive undertaking against an entrenched incumbent.

### III. Flaws in the "Diversification and Global Expansion" Strategy

1.  **Integration and Synergies of Acquisitions are Unproven:** The long-term plan relies on successfully executing and integrating global acquisitions (e.g., The International Stock Exchange, Bermuda Stock Exchange). There is a high risk that the expected synergies and revenue contributions from these integrations will fail to materialize, especially for a smaller exchange operator with less M\&A experience than its global rivals.
2.  **Market Share Saturation and Competition in Options:** Although MIAX has done well to capture **16.7%** of the U.S. options market in Q2 2025, acquiring the next percentage points will likely be increasingly difficult and require escalating transaction fee incentives, which would further squeeze the already thin profit margins. The market remains highly fragmented and controlled by multiple, powerful players.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX)

**MIAX's path to becoming a "multi-asset trading powerhouse" is fundamentally undermined by a closing technology gap, structural profitability weaknesses, and severe execution risk in its expansionary efforts.**

The company's primary competitive advantage—ultra-low latency technology—is rapidly being neutralized by the massive R\&D budgets of entrenched rivals like Cboe and Nasdaq, who are deploying next-generation platforms globally. The promise of "reliable, high-margin revenue" is directly contradicted by the company’s current low net profit margin (0.14%) and recent negative earnings growth, suggesting that intense competition and fee-for-order-flow structures are already pressuring profitability. Furthermore, the supposed "immediate" futures revenue is at least six to twelve months away, representing a high-risk venture into a market (index futures) dominated by an entrenched monopoly (CME Group). Combined with persistent regulatory threats to its high-margin market data revenue and the high execution risk of integrating international acquisitions, MIAX is an execution story with razor-thin margins and a shrinking competitive moat.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent and thorough analysis that has successfully identified the core arguments, execution risks, and major financial ambiguity. You have enough information to form a strong conclusion, but a few critical questions remain that directly challenge the heart of the "Long Thesis."

Here are the most important next steps and questions left unanswered, which focus on corroborating or refuting the high-risk points of the Bear Case.

***

## Critical Unanswered Questions and Next Steps

### I. Financial & Profitability Ambiguity (The Revenue-Earnings Disconnect)

1.  **Determine the Source of the Historical Revenue Spike:** The financial data shows a forecast of **-22.1% revenue decline** but **+45.5% earnings growth** over three years. This is a massive contradiction that suggests the historical revenue base was inflated by a large, non-recurring event.
    *   **Action:** Search for MIAX press releases or SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) from **late 2024 or early 2025** that specifically mention **"one-time gain,"** **"sale of assets,"** or **"non-operating income"** to identify the source of the high prior-year revenue base that analysts are normalizing away. This clarifies whether the future is growth (from the core business) or a genuine, fundamental collapse of sales.

2.  **Analyze the True Core Profit Margin:** The Bear Case relies on the TTM Net Profit Margin of **0.14%**.
    *   **Question:** What does the **Operating Margin (EBITDA)** look like *after* factoring in the full operating costs of the new MIAX Sapphire options floor and the new MIAX Futures Onyx platform, but *before* the expected 2026 futures revenue ramps up? This will confirm if the core options business is truly "high-margin" as the long thesis claims, or if current competition is making it a break-even operation.

### II. Competitive Moat (The Missing Microseconds)

3.  **Quantify the Ultra-Low-Latency Edge:** The long thesis is built on "proprietary, low-latency technology," but this technological moat is being challenged by Cboe's/Nasdaq's new platforms.
    *   **Question:** What is the **quantifiable tick-to-trade latency** (measured in microseconds/nanoseconds) of **MIAX's core options platform** compared directly to the most modern Cboe or Nasdaq options platforms today? This crucial number is the core competitive advantage and must be either proven or debunked. (Note: This may require highly specific search terms targeting HFT/trading firm reports, not general news.)

### III. Execution Risk in New Markets (Futures Liquidity)

4.  **Investigate Futures Liquidity Incentives:** The biggest long-term catalyst is the February 2026 launch of the Bloomberg Index futures into a market (index futures) that is monopolized by CME Group.
    *   **Question:** What **fee incentives, rebates, or market maker programs** has MIAX publicly announced or filed with the CFTC to attract initial liquidity providers (the Citadel, Virtu, etc.) to the new B500/B100Q futures products? The product differentiation alone is often insufficient; the economic incentive must be irresistible for market makers to allocate capital away from CME's highly liquid products.

5.  **Evaluate the New Options Floor's Performance:** The MIAX Sapphire options exchange launched a new **physical trading floor** in late 2025, a surprising move in an electronic market.
    *   **Action:** Search for **MIAX Sapphire's monthly volume and market share figures** following the **September 2025 physical floor launch** to assess whether the strategic differentiator has immediately paid off by capturing flow (especially from existing physical floors like the Cboe/NYSE Amex options floors).
