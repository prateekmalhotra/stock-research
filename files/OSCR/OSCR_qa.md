## Business Summary

Oscar Health, Inc. operates as a technology-enabled health insurance company focused primarily on the individual health insurance market, often utilizing government marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The customers are individuals and families seeking health coverage, located in specific, regionalized areas across the United States. The company also offers plans to small businesses and seniors (Medicare Advantage). The core business model involves collecting fixed monthly payments, known as premiums, from its members and then using those funds to pay for the members' healthcare claims (medical bills). Oscar aims to make money by keeping the total cost of claims significantly lower than the total premiums collected. It achieves this efficiency by using its proprietary technology platform, named +Oscar, which helps manage care, guides members toward lower-cost doctors, and emphasizes virtual care options. Premium revenue accounts for the vast majority of its income.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is medical cost volatility. Like all insurance companies, Oscar must accurately predict how much healthcare its members will use. If members utilize significantly more expensive healthcare services (e.g., unexpected hospitalizations, new high-cost drugs) than the company estimated when setting premiums, it immediately loses money. This has historically caused large losses for newer insurers and is a constant cause for concern, especially when unpredictable events like public health crises occur. A major long-term risk relates to regulatory and political instability. Oscar relies heavily on the structure and funding of the ACA marketplaces. Changes in federal regulations, cuts to subsidies that help members pay for insurance, or mandates regarding required coverage could drastically alter the market structure, forcing Oscar to either increase prices significantly or exit markets, thereby harming its earnings and market position. Finally, the dependence on its core technology (+Oscar) presents a risk. If the technology fails to accurately predict costs, steer members efficiently, or scale effectively across new geographic markets, the company loses its competitive edge and struggles to prove that its high operating costs are justified.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the journey of Oscar Health, Inc. (OSCR) in simple, jargon-free language.

### **The Inception and Founding Goal**

1.  **Founding and Frustration (2012):** Oscar Health was founded in New York City in 2012 by Mario Schlosser, Josh Kushner, and Kevin Nazemi.
2.  **The "Why" â€“ A Broken System:** The founders were motivated by their own frustrating, complex experiences with traditional health insurance, such as trying to understand high hospital bills after a personal injury or a pregnancy.
3.  **The Core Mission:** Their goal was to make health insurance easy to understand, simple to use, and more affordable for everyone by building a company "that behaves like a doctor in the family."
4.  **A Tech Company, Not Just an Insurer:** Oscar was unique because it was the first health insurance company built around a **"full-stack technology platform."** This means they created their entire business from the ground up using modern technology, instead of relying on outdated systems like older insurance companies.

### **Early Growth and Major Tailwinds (Favorable Conditions)**

5.  **The ACA Tailwind:** A major favorable condition was the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**, which rolled out new health insurance marketplaces (exchanges) around the time Oscar was founded, creating a brand new market for individual and family plans that they could enter easily.
6.  **First Launch:** In 2013, Oscar launched its first health plans on the New York State exchange, targeting individuals and families who were often confused by traditional options.
7.  **Venture Capital Confidence:** The company attracted large investments from prominent tech investors, including Google, who were confident that Oscar's technology-driven approach could disrupt the slow-moving healthcare industry.
8.  **Early Tech Advantage:** Oscar immediately differentiated itself by offering user-friendly digital tools like mobile apps, virtual doctor visits (telemedicine), and clear tools for finding doctors and tracking deductibles.

### **Problems (Headwinds) and Innovative Solutions**

9.  **Headwind: The Profitability Challenge:** One of the biggest difficulties has been achieving consistent profits; like many startups, Oscar spent years reporting net losses due to high medical costs and the challenge of managing healthcare expenses efficiently while growing.
10. **Solution: The +Oscar Platform:** To manage costs and improve service, they developed their proprietary technology platform, **+Oscar**. This platform is the "brain" of the company, integrating all functions from billing to member engagement to help run the business more efficiently.
11. **Solution: Member-Focused "Care Guides":** Oscar introduced a personalized customer service model using **Care Guides**. These are dedicated teams of nurses and care-takers who act as a single point of contact for a member, helping them navigate the complex system, find the right doctors, and understand their bills.
12. **Headwind: Competition and High Costs:** Oscar faced intense competition from much larger, established insurance companies and a constant industry-wide problem: rising healthcare costs, which forced them to continuously adjust their prices and strategy.
13. **Solution: Transparency and Virtual Care:** To address rising costs and complexity, Oscar focused on making prices more transparent and offered **Virtual Urgent Care**, which allows members to see a doctor quickly online, often for free, reducing the need for expensive in-person or emergency room visits.

### **Present Day (2021 to Present)**

14. **Going Public:** In March 2021, Oscar Health had its Initial Public Offering (IPO), becoming a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (OSCR), which marked a major milestone and raised significant capital for expansion.
15. **Focus on Efficiency:** After the IPO, the company began to strategically reduce its focus on less profitable markets and focused on improving its financial health by making its operations more efficient and lowering its Medical Loss Ratio (the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims).
16. **Current Status and Goal:** Oscar currently serves approximately 1.6 to 2 million members across multiple states, primarily through the individual ACA exchanges. Their immediate business goal is to achieve and maintain sustainable profitability by leveraging their technology and member-centric approach to manage healthcare costs more effectively than traditional insurers.

## Moat Analysis

Oscar Health's competitive advantage, or moat, is primarily built on its proprietary, full-stack technology platform, which enables a superior consumer experience and data-driven cost management that is difficult for legacy insurers to replicate.

### Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Full-Stack Technology Platform (+Oscar):** Oscar's main differentiator is that it was built from the ground up as a technology company operating in the highly regulated health insurance space, unlike traditional insurers that are constrained by legacy systems. Its proprietary platform, named **+Oscar**, manages everything from customer-facing services to claims processing, risk adjustment, and provider engagement.
2.  **Consumer-Centric Digital Experience:** The company offers a highly user-friendly and digital-first experience via its mobile app, including personalized health insights, free telemedicine, and tools for transparent pricing, which leads to high customer engagement and satisfaction. This focus on simplifying a traditionally complex product sets it apart from the old guard of health insurance.
3.  **Data-Driven Competitive Pricing:** Oscar leverages AI-powered data analytics for its underwriting and risk selection, which helps them accurately price their plans and manage medical costs better than rivals. This efficiency, coupled with a narrow-network strategy (partnering with a smaller, selected group of cost-effective providers), allows Oscar to often offer competitively priced Bronze and Silver tier plans.

### Special Position and Growth Drivers

4.  **Special Market Position (ACA Individual Market):** Oscar Health is a major and rapidly growing player in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Individual and Family plan market, a segment that has seen significant growth and is key to its strategy. Its model aligns well with the policy shift towards individual-purchased healthcare, including the emerging Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) market.
5.  **Growth Driver: Data Flywheel Effect:** The company's rapid growth is powered by a data-driven feedback loop: more members mean more data, which improves their AI-powered models for pricing, engagement, and care guidance. These improvements lead to lower costs and better value for members, which in turn drives more membership growth and higher retention, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

### Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk

6.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** Health insurance is a recurring annual subscription business. Oscar has demonstrated better-than-average customer stickiness, reporting that 79% of its 2024 members actively renewed for 2025, a rate that is meaningfully above the general exchange average. High retention extends the Customer Lifetime Value and lowers the cost of acquiring new members.
7.  **Displacement Risk (The Capital Question):** While any company in a capital-intensive, regulated industry faces risk, Oscar's primary defense against a heavily capitalized new entrant is the complexity of its **full-stack vertical integration** and the time it would take to build a similar proprietary, regulatory-compliant tech platform. However, the business model remains exposed to major regulatory risks, such as the potential expiration of enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which could significantly impact the entire individual insurance market.

### Moat Reinforcement and Innovation

8.  **Moat Building: Externalizing Technology:** Oscar is actively transforming its moat by licensing its technology platform, **+Oscar**, to other health plans and providers as a B2B service. This creates a high-margin, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-like revenue stream, diversifying the company's income away from being a pure insurance business and scaling its technological advantage beyond its own members.
9.  **High Investment in R&D and Constant Innovation:** The company invests heavily in technology and development, with a stated focus on rapidly deploying new AI and machine learning tools across its business. For example, its AI has been used to automate customer service functions and improve clinical outcomes, like reducing hospital readmission rates by nearly 10% in some cases, directly lowering long-term medical costs. This ongoing, aggressive innovation is essential to maintain the competitive edge derived from its technology-driven model.

## Catalyst Analysis

Oscar Health, Inc.'s (OSCR) stock catalysts are mainly centered on its path to consistent profitability, leveraging its technology platform, and capitalizing on the growth of the individual health insurance marketplace.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Successful Management of 2025 Headwinds:** The company's recent results from Q2 2025 showed an increase in the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) due to higher market morbidity and an increased risk adjustment payment, leading to a projected loss for 2025. The near-term catalyst is showing that the pricing and operational actions (including planned double-digit rate increases for 2026) are effective in controlling costs and stabilizing its financial performance.

2.  **Return to Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income Profitability:** Management has guided for a return to profitability, specifically projecting a return to positive results in **2026**. Hitting this target, after the expected 2025 loss, would be a major positive catalyst.

3.  **Realization of Administrative Cost Savings:** Oscar Health has consistently improved its SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative) expense ratio by leveraging its fixed technology costs and achieving variable cost efficiencies. Management is targeting administrative cost reductions that are expected to save approximately **$60 million in 2026**.

4.  **Strong 2026 Open Enrollment Performance:** The company is one of the fastest-growing players in the individual insurance market, leveraging its digital platform for customer engagement. Strong membership growth and better-than-expected retention rates from the 2026 Open Enrollment Period would signal confidence in their pricing strategy and ability to execute.

### Long-Term Catalysts (2027 and Beyond)

1.  **Achieving Long-Term Financial Targets:** Management is focused on achieving sustained profitable growth and has set long-term targets of at least **20% top-line compound annual revenue growth and a 5% operating margin by 2027**. Hitting these publicly stated goals would fundamentally re-rate the stock.

2.  **Scaling the Technology Platform ($+$Oscar):** Oscar is a healthcare technology company built on a full-stack platform, and its strategy, termed "refactoring healthcare," is to use data-driven insights to make the insurance experience more user-friendly and cost-effective. Successfully expanding its +Oscar technology platform to new external payor and provider partners represents a high-margin, scalable revenue stream beyond its core insurance business.

3.  **Expanding into New Market Segments (ICHRA/Group):** The company is working to build out its Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) capabilities and forming new partnerships (like with Hy-Vee Health) to serve the employer market and accelerate adoption of the individual market. This strategic diversification would reduce its reliance on the individual exchange market and tap into larger group health segments.

4.  **Maturation of the ACA Marketplace:** Management emphasizes that the individual market has greater long-term upside and is the future of health care, driven by consumer choice. As the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace matures and risk profiles stabilize, Oscar's ability to drive sustained underwriting profitability through its data and technology will be a major long-term driver.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of Oscar Health, Inc.'s (OSCR) 2024 Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), the management compensation structure is largely designed to align executive incentives with the financial and strategic interests of shareholders.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership (Skin in the Game)**

1.  **Low Direct CEO Ownership:** The CEO, Mark Bertolini, holds a relatively modest direct ownership stake, reported at approximately 0.74% of the company's shares. While any direct holding is positive, this percentage is not significantly high and suggests that a substantial portion of his net worth is not tied to the stock outside of his equity awards.
2.  **Founder's Equity:** Co-founder Mario Schlosser, who serves as President, Technology, and Chief Technology Officer, has received a substantial portion of his total compensation in equity awards, which provides a stronger alignment with long-term shareholder value.

#### **2. Compensation Structure and Alignment**

1.  **Equity-Weighted Pay:** The executive compensation package is heavily weighted toward long-term incentive equity (stock awards), which are typically the largest component of total compensation for the Named Executive Officers (NEOs). This structure forces managers to focus on long-term stock price appreciation, a key shareholder priority.
2.  **Below-Market CEO Pay:** The CEO's total yearly compensation is reported to be below the average for companies of similar size in the U.S. market, which may suggest a prudent approach to compensation cost control.
3.  **Focus on Profitability and Growth Metrics:** The annual cash incentive bonuses for NEOs are based on the achievement of corporate performance metrics that include:
    *   **Financial Metrics:** **Adjusted EBITDA** (cited as the "most important performance measure") to drive profitability.
    *   **Growth Metrics:** **Direct & Assumed Premiums** (revenue) to incentivize top-line growth.
    *   **Efficiency Metrics:** **Operating Leverage** and **Strategic Initiatives** related to new insurance products.

#### **3. Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Alignment**

1.  **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR):** The long-term equity awards are tied to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to a defined peer group, which ensures executives are rewarded only if Oscar Health's stock outperforms its direct competitors. This is considered a best practice for shareholder alignment, as it rewards performance beyond general market movements.
2.  **Multi-Year Vesting/Performance:** The CEO's large initial equity grant in 2023 was designed to be his sole equity compensation for a three-year period (2023-2025), necessitating a long-term focus on value creation.

### **Conclusion**

**Oscar Health's management generally has strong incentives to act in the interest of shareholders.**

The compensation structure achieves alignment by:
*   **Emphasizing Equity:** A majority of the executive compensation is tied to long-term equity awards that only gain significant value if the stock price rises.
*   **Using Relevant Performance Metrics:** The incentive metrics directly link pay to financial results (Adjusted EBITDA), business growth (Premiums), operational efficiency (Operating Leverage), and stock market performance (Relative TSR).

The primary mitigating factor is the low direct insider ownership of the CEO at 0.74%, which can sometimes signal less personal risk being taken. However, the heavy weighting of performance-based equity compensation, especially one measured against competitors (Relative TSR), mitigates this concern by aligning future wealth directly with shareholder returns.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Oscar Health rests on its ability to transition from a high-growth, unprofitable insurer into a focused, highly efficient, technology-driven healthcare platform. In the near term, strong new management (ex-Aetna CEO) is successfully executing a financial turnaround by strictly controlling medical costs and administrative spending. This is leading to clear targets for sustained profitability starting in 2026. Over the long term, Oscar will capitalize on two major drivers: first, its continued rapid, profitable growth within the expanding individual insurance market (ACA exchanges), where its digital-first tools and data make it a clear consumer favorite. Second, the company will increasingly license its core proprietary technology platform, called +Oscar, to external health systems and providers. This shift transforms Oscar into a scalable, high-margin software service provider, generating stable revenue that is less dependent on the volatile business of underwriting insurance risk.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that Oscar can execute its turnaround plan, successfully achieving and maintaining positive net income and operating margins by 2026 and beyond. This further assumes that its proprietary technology continues to effectively lower medical costs and streamline operations better than traditional insurers. The long-term thesis also relies heavily on the political stability of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace, ensuring government subsidies and rules remain favorable to the individual insurance market. Finally, the assumption is that the high-margin +Oscar technology licensing business scales rapidly and successfully attracts major external partners, providing a strong, diversified revenue stream.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and points of vulnerability in the bull thesis for Oscar Health, Inc. (OSCR).

## Bear Case Critique: Flaws and Holes in the Oscar Health Long Thesis

### 1. The Financial Turnaround and Path to Profitability is Volatile and Unreliable

*   **Profitability Reversal and High MLR:** The turnaround success is fragile. After achieving the company's first annual net income in 2024, Oscar posted a significant net loss of \$228 million in Q2 2025, driven by a surge in the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) to 91.1%. This abrupt reversal suggests its proprietary technology is not consistently effective at controlling medical costs, challenging the core assumption of operational efficiency.
*   **2026 Profitability is a Forecast, Not a Trend:** The goal of "sustained profitability starting in 2026" is based on planned, significant premium rate increases and market stabilization, not a proven track record. The company's full-year 2025 outlook still projects a large operating loss (up to \$300 million), indicating that the immediate trend is moving away from profitability.
*   **Growth at a Cost:** Rapid membership growth, while driving revenue, has come with a sicker-than-expected member base, which increases the risk adjustment transfer accruals and medical costs, undercutting the narrative of *profitable* growth.

### 2. Extreme Regulatory/Political Risk to Core Business (The ACA Market)

*   **Reliance on Expiring Subsidies:** The long-term thesis heavily relies on the "political stability of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace," but the enhanced ACA subsidies are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.
*   **Direct Membership & Revenue Threat:** If Congress fails to extend these subsidies due to political gridlock, it could cause millions to lose coverage, dramatically increasing premiums, and Oscar itself projects an 18% decline in membership. Since Oscar's core business is centered on the ACA individual market, this political uncertainty is an existential risk to the entire growth trajectory.

### 3. The Tech Platform Diversification (+Oscar) is Currently Insignificant

*   **Minimal Revenue Contribution:** The bull case's vision of Oscar becoming a "scalable, high-margin software service provider" generating a "strong, diversified revenue stream" through its +Oscar platform is currently unsupported by financials. +Oscar's revenue is currently a fraction of one percent of the company's total revenue, making it a nascent initiative, not a diversified revenue stream.
*   **Difficulty in Scaling Enterprise Software:** Scaling an enterprise technology platform in the highly competitive and risk-averse healthcare provider/payer market is a long, difficult process. The assumption that +Oscar can "scale rapidly and successfully attract major external partners" in the near term is a high-risk, speculative element of the thesis.

### 4. Consumer Preference is Mixed and Customer Satisfaction is Low

*   **High Complaint Rate Undercuts "Consumer Favorite" Claim:** While Oscar's digital tools (mobile app, user experience) receive high marks, the company has also received a high number of customer complaints compared to its size and its plans have been poorly rated by HealthCare.gov.
*   **Network & Cost Limitations:** Members have expressed dissatisfaction with limited plan choices, above-average costs compared to some competitors, and restricted in-network doctor availability, indicating that the digital-first experience does not fully offset traditional healthcare pain points.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for Oscar Health, Inc. (OSCR)

**Oscar Health's highly volatile insurance business will continue to overshadow its technology ambitions, preventing it from achieving sustained profitability and justifying its "insurtech" valuation.**

The bear case posits that Oscar is a financially unstable insurance company with high operational risk, not a scalable software company.

1.  **Profitability is Ephemeral:** The company's recent severe spike in Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) proves that its proprietary technology has not insulated it from industry-wide cost pressures and risk-pool uncertainty, forcing it into a cycle of large premium hikes to achieve its 2026 profit goal, which will inevitably slow future membership growth.
2.  **Structural Business Risk from ACA Subsidies:** Oscarâ€™s hyper-focus on the ACA marketplace exposes the company to extreme, binary political risk. The looming expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies is a critical headwind that could immediately contract the companyâ€™s addressable market, leading to mass member departures and an immediate revenue decline.
3.  **The "+Oscar" Tech Platform is a Distraction:** The high-margin software business is too small to be a material source of revenue or diversification for years, if ever. Relying on this **\<1% revenue business** to transition Oscar into a "scalable, high-margin software service provider" is speculative, given the difficulty of displacing established healthcare IT vendors.
4.  **Valuation Risk:** Despite the management team's execution on cost cutting, Oscar is ultimately competing with massive, well-capitalized incumbent health insurers. As a health *insurer*, its valuation should reflect its risk profile (low-margin, highly-regulated, volatile capital requirements), rather than the lofty multiples associated with a high-growth *technology* company.

---

## Next Steps

The initial investigation has provided critical and actionable information, particularly around the two main risks: the ACA subsidies and the path to profitability.

Here are the most important questions still left unanswered and the next steps you should investigate:

### **1. Financial Execution and Risk (The 2026 Profitability Pivot)**

The core question is whether Oscar's planned 2026 profitability is a sustainable outcome or a temporary fix that will kill growth.

*   **The Specific Impact of 2026 Premium Hikes:** The overall ACA marketplace median proposed premium increase for 2026 is a massive **18%**, with Oscar's Pennsylvania filing showing an average proposed rate change of **22.0%**. This is a key part of the turnaround plan.
    *   **Next Step:** **Investigate the projected enrollment impact of Oscar's premium increases.** Large, above-average hikes often lead to high churn or loss of healthier members ("adverse selection"). Find analyst reports or management commentary on how they plan to retain members despite these significant price increases.

*   **Detailed MLR Drivers and Normalization:** The Q2 2025 MLR surged to 91.1% due to "elevated market morbidity and a $316 million increase in risk adjustment payables".
    *   **Next Step:** **Research the *causes* of "elevated market morbidity" for Oscar specifically.** Is it linked to their high growth, meaning they attracted a disproportionately sicker risk pool, or is it purely industry-wide utilization (like GLP-1 drugs, which are mentioned as an industry-wide pressure point)? The distinction is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the *+Oscar* technology.

### **2. Technology Scaling and Diversification (+Oscar Platform)**

The bear case highlights that the high-margin +Oscar platform is currently insignificant, and the search results did not provide specific recent external *client wins* or revenue data.

*   **Quantifying the +Oscar Technology Revenue/Pipeline:** Management reported serving ">500k external client lives on the +Oscar platform" as of Q1 2024, but the revenue contribution remains minimal.
    *   **Next Step:** **Search for the latest revenue contribution of +Oscar.** The key to the long-term bull thesis is its transition to a high-margin tech company. Is +Oscar a material source of revenue yet? (Look for **"Oscar Health Q3 2025 +Oscar revenue"** or **"Oscar Health technology services revenue"**).

### **3. Political and Regulatory Certainty (The Existential Risk)**

The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, which is projected to cause premiums to rise by more than 75% for many enrollees and would lead to a large portion of the 20+ million subsidized individuals canceling their insurance.

*   **Current Legislative Action/Probability:** The search results indicate "increasing talk of extending" the subsidies, but their status is unresolved.
    *   **Next Step:** **Search for the most recent political update on the ACA subsidy extension or a specific bill/vote.** This is a binary risk (extension/no extension) that will dramatically impact membership, making it the most important catalyst to track right now.

### **4. Competitive Landscape and True Cost Advantage**

The competitor analysis is currently high-level. Oscar's differentiation relies on offering better value and a superior experience than giants like UnitedHealth Group and Elevance Health.

*   **Direct Comparison of MLR and Pricing Strategy:** The overall industry is also raising prices aggressively (median 18% hike for 2026).
    *   **Next Step:** **Compare Oscar's 2025/2026 MLR guidance (86-87% target) against key national competitors in the ACA market.** Is Oscar's technology-enabled model actually generating a lower MLR or administrative cost structure than rivals like **Centene, UnitedHealthcare (UHC), or Elevance Health (ELV)** in the Individual market? This will test the moat's core promise.
