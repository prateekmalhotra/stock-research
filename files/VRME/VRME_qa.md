## Business Summary

VerifyMe, Inc. is a technology company that helps large businesses protect their brands from fake products, operating primarily on a business-to-business (B2B) model. Its customers are global corporations, especially those in high-value sectors like luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products, where brand authenticity is crucial. The core business model involves selling specialized, invisible security inks, labels, and serialization software that clients apply to their products. VerifyMe earns revenue primarily through the sale of these unique, proprietary security consumables and associated technology licenses, which allows client companies to track items and verify their genuineness throughout the supply chain.

---

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk is the intense competition within the brand protection and anti-counterfeiting market. Competitors are constantly introducing new security technologies, meaning VerifyMe must invest heavily in research and development (R&D) to ensure its markers remain difficult to replicate. If a competitor offers a cheaper or more effective solution, VerifyMe’s earnings could be immediately harmed, a concern that is ever-present in technology sectors. Another near-term risk is dependency on key, large corporate clients; losing even one major contract could drastically reduce revenue quickly. A major long-term risk involves the threat of technological obsolescence. Counterfeiters continually adapt and find new ways to bypass security features, requiring VerifyMe’s technology to evolve rapidly. If VerifyMe fails to keep pace with these threats or if integrating new acquisitions proves difficult, its market position could erode, severely weakening its long-term profitability.

## Company History

This is a detailed, jargon-free history of VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME), from its beginnings to its current strategy.

### **The Inception and Founding Goal (1999 - 2015)**

1.  **Original Beginning (1999):** The company was originally founded as LaserLock Technologies, Inc. in 1999.
2.  **The Core Problem:** The fundamental problem the business was created to solve was the massive global issue of **counterfeiting** and **brand protection**. It aimed to give brands a way to prove that their products were real.
3.  **The Early Solution:** The company focused on developing technology to embed unique physical security markers—like special inks or micro-particles—onto products and packaging to make them nearly impossible to fake and easy to verify.
4.  **Strategic Pivot and Rebranding:** A significant operational shift occurred around 2015-2016, and the company officially changed its name to **VerifyMe, Inc.** in July 2015, solidifying its focus on authentication technology and supply chain security.

### **Innovative Solutions and Growth Through Acquisition (2015 - 2023)**

5.  **The Digital Solution:** VerifyMe’s innovative approach was to connect its proprietary physical security features with a **digital cloud platform**. This way, a simple scan (with a mobile app or special device) could instantly verify a product's authenticity and gather data.
6.  **Key Tailwind (Counterfeiting):** A major market advantage (tailwind) for VerifyMe has been the ever-increasing need for secure commerce. The growth of global e-commerce and the rise of sophisticated counterfeit operations created a huge, growing demand for effective anti-counterfeiting solutions.
7.  **The Headwind (Small-Cap Status):** A consistent challenge (headwind) was competing as a small, publicly traded company against much larger competitors in the broad brand protection technology market, making it difficult to gain market share quickly and achieve profitability.
8.  **The Growth Strategy (Acquisitions):** To overcome scale challenges, the company pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy between 2020 and 2023 to expand its offerings.

### **The Major Strategic Shift to Logistics (2023 - Present)**

9.  **The Diversifying Solution:** The most important strategic move was the acquisition of **PeriShip Global**, a specialized company focused on **Precision Logistics**. This business uses sophisticated software to manage the exact, time-critical shipping of time- and temperature-sensitive goods.
10. **New Headwind (Authentication Troubles):** Despite the acquisitions, the core Authentication segment began facing new difficulties. This included a decline in revenue and the decision to close its Trust Codes Global platform (an authentication asset acquired in 2023) by the end of 2024 due to operational and financial challenges, indicating an integration failure or poor performance.
11. **New Tailwind (The Logistics Niche):** The Precision Logistics segment, however, provided a strong, specialized market advantage (tailwind). This service is vital for shipping high-value items like medical biologics (sensitive medicines) and specialty foods, a niche market with rising regulatory demand and high profit potential.
12. **The New Goal (Focus on Logistics):** Today, the company's goal has shifted dramatically. While still offering brand protection, the management has placed a strong emphasis on the **Precision Logistics segment** as its primary driver for future growth and creating shareholder value.
13. **Current State:** VerifyMe now operates with two segments: **Authentication** (protecting products from fakes) and **Precision Logistics** (ensuring critical products like temperature-sensitive biologics arrive on time). The company is strategically focused on streamlining operations and leveraging its logistics technology while carefully managing its cash reserves.

## Moat Analysis

VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME) operates with a dual business model—Authentication and Precision Logistics—meaning its competitive advantages, or "moats," are found in two different areas of its business.

### Analysis of the Moat (Competitive Advantage)

1.  **Patented, Covert Authentication Technology (The Tech Moat):** VerifyMe's core technological moat lies in its **VerifyInk™**, a proprietary and patented covert (invisible) security ink. This ink is integrated with taggants and can be printed on existing, high-volume digital printing systems (like HP Indigo) and Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) printers.

2.  **Integrated Digital and Physical Solution (Differentiation):** The true distinction is not just the ink, but the end-to-end system: the invisible, serialized ink is paired with proprietary, patented reading devices (like VerifyAuthenticator™) that use a smartphone app to scan the code and send the unique digital signature to a secure, cloud-based platform for instant authentication and track-and-trace. This combination of a unique physical marker that is difficult to replicate, a proprietary reader, and cloud software creates a comprehensive solution that raises the barrier for counterfeiters and competitors.

3.  **Niche in Precision Logistics (The Service Moat):** The majority of VerifyMe's revenue comes from its Precision Logistics segment (PeriShip Global), which specializes in managing the shipment of complex, time- and temperature-sensitive products (like perishable food and healthcare items). The moat here is built on a proprietary software platform providing predictive analytics, such as pre-shipment weather and flight-tracking, which reduces risk for high-value cargo.

***

### Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Market Position

1.  **Special Position in the Market:** VerifyMe's unique position stems from combining its brand authentication technology with its highly specialized logistics expertise. This allows the company to serve high-value niche markets, particularly where anti-counterfeiting, supply chain monitoring, and cold-chain logistics intersect.

2.  **Differentiation from Competitors:** The primary differentiation is offering the *only* covert serialization and authentication solution capable of being printed directly onto products using common high-speed digital printing systems (like HP Indigo and CIJ printers) and authenticated using a custom smartphone integration. This compatibility with existing industrial printing infrastructure allows brands to deploy brand protection at a **low cost** and high-scale, suggesting a value-based differentiation rather than purely premium pricing.

3.  **Pricing Power:** The information does not clearly indicate strong *pricing power*. While the integrated, patented technology is unique, the push to make the solution "low-cost" suggests they are competing on affordability and ease of integration for the mass market. The loss of a significant, high-margin contract in their logistics segment also shows that their pricing and service offerings are subject to a customer's strategic realignment and competitive pressures.

***

### Growth, Displacement Risk, and Stickiness

1.  **Reason for Growth:** The company's recent growth into a dual-segment business is primarily due to strategic acquisitions, such as PeriShip Global for Precision Logistics (majority revenue generator) and Trust Codes Global (recently divested) for their authentication platform, effectively transforming its capabilities into a more integrated supply chain solution provider.

2.  **Customer/Contract Stickiness:** Contracts are **not inherently sticky** enough to prevent major revenue loss; a significant, high-margin contract in the Precision Logistics segment was terminated due to a customer's strategic realignment, causing a material revenue decrease. However, the nature of the service creates *switching costs*, as transitioning a complex, proprietary logistics platform (procedural cost) and re-integrating a customized physical-digital authentication system involves time, effort, and risk for the customer.

3.  **Risk of Displacement by Capital-Rich Competitors:** The risk is elevated because the company is relatively small with a small market capitalization.
    *   In **Precision Logistics**, a large competitor with significant capital could invest heavily to offer comparable predictive analytics or better rates, acquiring key customers by absorbing the switching costs.
    *   In **Authentication**, while the patented technology provides a barrier, large competitors with vast R&D budgets could develop alternative, or superior, covert serialization methods and leverage their existing relationships and scale to outcompete.

4.  **Investment in R&D and Innovation:** Historically, R&D investment has been low, with the company's focus shifting to commercialization rather than fundamental research. While there is a stated commitment to *continue* R&D for expanding implementation and unique applications, the relatively minor R&D spend in the past suggests the **moat is built on a few core, legacy patents** (VerifyInk/taggant tech) and specific integration expertise, rather than a continuous, high-cost innovation engine. This low level of investment requires them to constantly innovate or partner smartly to maintain the technological edge.

## Management Record

Based on the available information, here is an analysis of the management of VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME) for an investor.

### Current Management: CEO Adam Stedham (Appointed June 2023)

1.  **CEO Background and Track Record:** Adam Stedham's prior experience includes successfully serving as CEO of the NYSE-listed **GP Strategies**, which was eventually sold for approximately **$400 million** after its revenue grew to over $450 million. His professional background demonstrates significant expertise in strategic relationship management, acquisitions, divestitures, integrating businesses, and managing global operations.

2.  **Management Team Alignment and History:** The current executive team and Board show a clear alignment with the CEO's background; Chairman **Scott N. Greenberg** and CFO **Jennifer Cola** (appointed May 2025) both previously held senior roles at GP Strategies, which suggests a deliberate attempt to build a team with a shared, successful history of scaling a publicly-traded company.

3.  **Key Decisions and Performance Delivery:** Stedham's tenure has been marked by a focus on cost control and strategic realignment following initial acquisitions. Key decisions include **doubling the annual Adjusted EBITDA** in 2024 compared to 2023, increasing annual gross profit by 8% in 2024, and generating **positive cash flow** from operations.

4.  **Strategic Divestiture and Focus:** A major decision was the **divestiture of the unprofitable Trust Codes Global business** in December 2024 and announcing a possible exit from the Amazon Transparency partnership to concentrate on more profitable areas like ink products within the Authentication segment. This shows management is executing a strategy to increase profitability by cutting non-performing assets.

5.  **Shareholder Value and Confidence:** The CEO demonstrated personal confidence in the company by **acquiring additional shares of common stock** in late 2024 as the stock traded near its 52-week low. Additionally, the company extended its **share repurchase program** to return value to shareholders.

6.  **Challenges and Historical Shareholder Value:** Despite operational improvements in efficiency, the stock has **underperformed** the US market and the Electronic industry over the past year. The company has faced a decline in revenue due to the loss of a major premium services customer in its Precision Logistics segment and its stock has been highly volatile. Shareholders have also experienced dilution in the past.

### Future Strategy and Vision

The company is specifically aiming for **adjusted EBITDA positivity by 2025**.

### Previous Management and Transition

9.  **Previous CEO Change:** The prior CEO, **Patrick White**, who was instrumental in transitioning the company from a development-stage to a commercialization-stage business, left in March 2023 to "pursue other opportunities." This transition led to the appointment of the current CEO, Adam Stedham, a few months later.

10. **Strategic Reorganization:** The shift to the current management team was followed by a strategic reorganization in July 2023, which saw the departure of the former President/COO and CFO, and the consolidation of their responsibilities into the CEO role to accelerate growth and optimize overhead. The Board specifically hired Stedham to **integrate the recent acquisitions** (PeriShip Global and Trust Codes) and drive significant shareholder value based on his track record.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME)**

**1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

*   **High Insider Ownership:** Managers and directors have a notable level of vested interest, with a reported **insider ownership of 20.52%** of the company's common stock.
*   **Strong Alignment Signal:** A high insider ownership percentage is generally considered a strong signal that management's financial success is directly tied to an increase in the company's share price, thus aligning their interests with those of the shareholders (higher the better).
*   **Board Commitment:** Individual directors have participated in the company's recent capital raises and are purchasing shares in the open market, further demonstrating commitment to the company's success and financial alignment.

**2. Executive Compensation Structure**

*   **Performance-Based Equity Focus:** A significant portion of executive compensation is comprised of equity awards, including **Performance-Based Stock Units (PSUs)**. For example, the CEO received a grant of 550,000 PSUs.
*   **Share-Price Hurdle Incentives:** Executive equity awards are specifically tied to ambitious share price targets, such as unvested Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that require the stock to reach price hurdles like **\$2.21, \$2.94, and \$3.68** before vesting. This structure heavily incentivizes long-term stock appreciation.
*   **Metric-Driven Short-Term Cash Bonus:** The company utilizes a Short-Term Incentive (STI) cash bonus plan for executives and employees, which is equally split based on achieving a pre-set **Adjusted EBITDA performance goal** and a **revenue performance goal**. This structure balances profitability (EBITDA) and top-line growth (Revenue).

**3. Director Compensation and Corporate Governance**

*   **Reduced Director Compensation:** The Board of Directors proactively agreed to reduce both their annual equity retainer and committee chair compensation by **50%**, effective after the 2024 shareholder meeting. This demonstrates a willingness to conserve capital and share in the company's financial discipline.
*   **Shareholder Say-on-Pay:** The company includes an advisory "say-on-pay" vote for executive compensation, allowing shareholders to voice their approval or disapproval of the Named Executive Officers' pay structure, which promotes good corporate governance.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

Based on the analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure, the management and directors of VerifyMe, Inc. appear to have **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The **20.52% insider ownership** means managers and directors are significant investors themselves, directly benefiting from share price appreciation.
*   The use of **performance-based equity with high share-price hurdles** strongly encourages long-term value creation, as executives only receive the full benefit of these awards if the stock price significantly increases.
*   The reduction in director pay and the tie of cash bonuses to **Adjusted EBITDA and Revenue** indicate a focus on operational performance and profitable growth, which are key drivers of shareholder value.

## Price History

Based on a review of recent price history and technical analysis for VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME) stock, here is an analysis of its current trading position and major price movements.

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is currently trading significantly closer to its 52-week low than its high. The 52-week trading range is very wide, with a high of approximately $5.00 and a low of about $0.5469.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** With a recent closing price around $0.84, VerifyMe is trading approximately **53.6%** above its 52-week low of $0.5469. While above the absolute low, the price remains at the lower end of its annual trading spectrum.

3.  **Technical Analysis and "Trading Low":** From a technical perspective, the stock appears to be trading near a potential bottom, with one analysis noting it is **oversold on the RSI14 indicator (15)**, which often suggests the stock may be due for a rebound. However, the short-term and long-term moving averages are giving 'Sell' signals, and the stock is considered "very high risk" due to high volatility and periodic low trading volume.

4.  **Major Price Spike (Big Gain):** The stock was **up bigly** in late July/early August 2025, with one report noting an 80% surge [cite: 4 in step 1 results, 7]. This massive gain was specifically driven by news that the company's subsidiary, PeriShip Global Solutions, had secured a new **three-year shipping agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS)**.

5.  **Recent Sharp Decline (Big Drop):** VerifyMe experienced a significant drop recently, falling by approximately **25%** in the 10 trading days leading up to mid-November 2025. This sharp pullback follows the late-summer spike and coincides with ongoing pressure from the **Nasdaq minimum bid price rule**, as the stock has struggled to maintain a closing price of $1.00 per share.

6.  **Nasdaq Compliance Headwind:** The company has been navigating a notice of non-compliance with the Nasdaq's $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. The necessity to regain compliance and the market's reaction to the risk of delisting can create a persistent downward pressure on the stock price.

---

## Long Thesis

VerifyMe has fundamentally changed its business focus from struggling anti-counterfeiting technology to a rapidly growing, specialized logistics company (PeriShip Global) that manages the time-critical, high-value shipping of sensitive products, such as specialized medicines and luxury perishables. The bull case rests on the idea that this specialized logistics niche, powered by proprietary tracking software, provides a strong, high-margin moat in a highly regulated industry. In the near term, a new, experienced management team is stabilizing the company by cutting costs, divesting failed assets, and proving they can consistently generate positive operating cash flow, which should push the company toward overall profitability (Adjusted EBITDA positivity by 2025). The long-term upside is driven by massive scalability: the company is integrating its logistics technology with a second major national freight carrier. Once complete (expected in 2026), this move will instantly double their market access for sensitive shipments, driving substantial organic revenue growth. This profitable core logistics business, combined with a healthy cash balance, positions the company to make strategic acquisitions to solidify its market dominance, potentially achieving $50 million to $60 million in annual revenues over the next five years, which would justify a significantly higher stock valuation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The most critical assumption is the successful technology integration with the second major freight carrier for the Precision Logistics segment by 2026, and that this partnership successfully translates into significant new customer adoption and revenue. It is also assumed that the new management team (led by former GP Strategies executives) continues its successful strategy of cost control, efficiently integrates any future acquisitions, and avoids the previous issues associated with assets like Trust Codes Global. Furthermore, the specialized logistics market for high-value, temperature-sensitive goods must continue its structural growth trend, justifying the company's niche focus. Finally, the company must successfully maintain its Nasdaq compliance (staying above $1.00 per share) to attract institutional investors and avoid distraction.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The provided long thesis has several critical assumptions and claims that can be challenged based on recent financial and operational performance.

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Contradiction of "Rapidly Growing" Core Business:** The foundational premise of a "rapidly growing" specialized logistics company is directly contradicted by the recent financial performance, as the core PeriShip Global revenue **decreased by approximately 14%** in Q2 2025 year-over-year. The decline was attributed primarily to previously announced large customer losses in 2024 and a discontinued higher-margin contract.
2.  **Erosion of "High-Margin Moat":** The claim of a "strong, high-margin moat" is weakened by the decrease in gross margin percentage for the Precision Logistics segment, which fell from 39% to 35% year-over-year in Q2 2025, indicating pricing pressure, mix shift to lower-margin services, or a less defensible niche than stated.
3.  **Extreme Customer Concentration Risk:** The business has high customer concentration, with the **top 5% of Proactive services customers generating over 60% of that segment's revenue**. This makes the company highly vulnerable to further losses of key accounts, which could instantaneously decimate revenue and invalidate future growth forecasts.
4.  **Unproven, Future Growth Catalyst (Carrier Integration):** The primary source of the "long-term upside" and "massive scalability"—the **successful technology integration with a second major freight carrier**—is a forward-looking expectation for 2026 and remains a major unproven assumption. A delay, technical issue, or failure to attract significant new customers via this new carrier would invalidate the entire organic growth strategy and the $50-$60 million revenue goal.
5.  **Discrepancy Between Adjusted EBITDA and Overall Profitability:** The management's achievement of **positive Adjusted EBITDA ($0.3 million in Q2 2025)** is positive, but the company still reported a **net GAAP loss** of $(\$0.29)$ million in the same quarter, and a $\$3.8$ million net loss for the full year 2024. Relying on non-GAAP profitability while consistently posting a net loss exposes the company to skepticism regarding its "overall profitability" goal.
6.  **Distracted Capital Allocation Strategy:** Management is using a portion of the "healthy cash balance" for a **short-term, high-interest loan to a third party (Zen Credit Ventures at 16%)** instead of immediately deploying all of it into "strategic acquisitions." This unusual treasury strategy suggests either a lack of immediate, accretive M&A targets or a need to manufacture higher short-term interest income, which dilutes the "strategic acquisition" part of the long-term thesis.
7.  **Recurring Nasdaq Compliance Risk:** The "must successfully maintain its Nasdaq compliance" is a proven recurring problem, as the company had to **regain compliance multiple times** (e.g., in October 2025) after receiving notices of non-compliance. This volatility and distraction can discourage the institutional investors that the thesis aims to attract.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for VerifyMe, Inc. (VRME)

The bear case for VerifyMe (VRME) rests on the risk that the company’s transition to specialized logistics is fundamentally unstable, and its future is dependent on high-risk, unproven, and externally controlled events.

1.  **Revenue and Customer Instability:** The core Precision Logistics segment is shrinking, not rapidly growing, with a significant year-over-year revenue decline due to **high customer concentration and the loss of major contracts**. The underlying business is fragile, and another single customer loss would critically impair the already-declining top line.
2.  **Uncertain Growth Engine:** The entire organic growth story is back-loaded into 2026 and relies on the successful and timely **technology integration with a second major freight carrier**. This integration is complex, externally controlled, and a major operational risk; failure to execute will result in a continued revenue decline and collapse of the long-term $50-$60 million revenue target.
3.  **Misleading Profitability and Balance Sheet Risk:** Management is focused on a narrow, non-GAAP positive **Adjusted EBITDA** while the company continues to post **net GAAP losses**, demonstrating that the business model is not yet structurally profitable. The "healthy cash balance" is being partially diverted into non-core, short-term, high-interest loans, raising questions about management's ability to find and execute accretive, long-term strategic acquisitions to drive the needed scale.
4.  **Value Trap:** The company is caught in a cycle of instability, evidenced by recurring Nasdaq compliance issues, a shrinking core revenue line, and decreasing gross margins. The long-term upside is a high-risk gamble on a future technical integration, turning the stock into a speculation on a single, delayed catalyst rather than an investment in a stable, predictable, "high-margin" enterprise.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent, deep analysis that clearly outlines the core investment debate between the high-risk, high-reward Long Thesis (future logistics growth) and the Bear Case (current revenue decline, execution risk, and unproven catalysts).

The initial search provided very specific, current data points that now refine the critical risks and opportunities.

Here are the most important next steps and questions to investigate further, structured to specifically challenge the assumptions in your Long Thesis and validate the risks in your Bear Case.

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

#### **1. Logistics (The Core Growth Catalyst)**

The primary risk is the execution of the new carrier strategy.

*   **Identify the New Logistics Partner(s) and Assess Transition Risk:** **Who is the new shipping partner** replacing FedEx for the Proactive services customers, and who is the "second major freight carrier" for the long-term growth? The loss of a major contract was a headwind; moving a whole segment off FedEx is a major operational change that presents a high transition risk and must be executed flawlessly to avoid customer churn.
*   **Validate the "Moat" Against Carrier Power:** Investigate the contractual terms and economic relationship between PeriShip Global and the major freight carriers. Does PeriShip's proprietary software genuinely give them leverage, or are they effectively a high-value re-seller whose margins are ultimately dictated by the carriers? This will confirm or debunk the "high-margin moat" claim.

#### **2. Capital Allocation and Financial Risk**

The high-interest loan is a significant red flag that needs scrutiny.

*   **De-risk the Zen Credit Ventures Loan:** Search for details on **Zen Credit Ventures**. What is the nature of their business? A 16% annual interest rate is highly attractive but suggests the loan is **substantially riskier** than a typical corporate investment. You need to understand the collateral, the borrower's financial health, and the management's detailed rationale for this treasury strategy to determine if they are engaging in high-risk lending to boost non-operating income.
*   **Analyze Working Capital and Cash Burn for Organic Growth:** Given the net GAAP losses, confirm the *required* investment for the "multi-month integration" with the second major carrier. Does the current cash balance of **\$6.1 million** (as of Q2 2025) cover the working capital needs for the shrinking core business, the R&D for the new integration, and the stated goal of strategic acquisitions, or is the capital too thinly spread?

#### **3. Authentication Segment (The Non-Core Business)**

The near-zero Q2 2025 Authentication revenue (\**\$27,000*\*) suggests this segment is essentially irrelevant.

*   **Determine the Viability of "VerifyInk" Focus:** What is the specific, remaining revenue stream and margin profile for the ink products (VerifyInk)? Management claims a "renewed focus" on the ink, but if the segment is generating near-zero revenue, is the focus a viable path to profitability or simply a distraction of executive time and resources?
*   **Quantify Acquisition Targets and Cost of Entry:** What is the nature of the "tuck-in" acquisitions management is seeking in the brand protection space? What would be the minimum price tag to acquire a profitable, scalable asset that could make the Authentication segment material again?

#### **4. Competitive Landscape and Market Size**

This is the most direct way to validate the long-term revenue target.

*   **Estimate the Size of the Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Search for the estimated TAM for **precision logistics/cold chain logistics for high-value/perishable goods** in North America. Compare the company's \$50-\$60 million five-year revenue goal to this TAM to see if the growth is aggressive, reasonable, or too conservative.
*   **Identify and Profile Direct Competitors for PeriShip:** Who are the primary competitors for specialized logistics beyond the major freight carriers (e.g., specialized 3PLs)? Analyzing their technology, pricing, and market share will help you assess the true defensibility and "stickiness" of PeriShip's proprietary software.
