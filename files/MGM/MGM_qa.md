## Business Summary

MGM operates large integrated resorts, primarily in the U.S. (Las Vegas Strip and regional states) and Macau, China, which combine high-end hotels, casinos, dining, retail, and entertainment venues. The core business model seeks to maximize profitability by drawing customers through attractive non-gaming amenities (like luxury rooms and major conventions) and then capturing high-margin revenue through its casinos. Customers range from mass-market tourists and convention attendees in the U.S. to high-spending international VIP gamblers. While non-gaming activities now account for a significant portion of revenue, gaming remains the foundational draw. MGM has also expanded into the digital space via BetMGM, its online sports betting and gaming platform, seeking to diversify revenue streams beyond its physical properties.

## Business Model Risk

The company’s reliance on discretionary spending makes its earnings highly cyclical, meaning revenue immediately contracts during economic recessions or downturns, as consumers prioritize essential needs over travel and gambling. A major long-term risk is geopolitical and regulatory volatility, particularly in Macau, which historically has been a key profit center. Changes in Chinese government policy regarding travel, licensing requirements, or oversight of high-roller gambling have caused massive, sudden revenue drops in the past (such as during the 2014 anti-corruption campaign), and ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China pose a continued threat to stable operations there. In the near term, MGM faces intense competition in the growing digital sports betting market; maintaining and growing its BetMGM platform requires massive, immediate marketing investment, putting short-term pressure on profits due to high customer acquisition costs.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on MGM Resorts International, a company that transformed from a Las Vegas casino operator into a global entertainment and hospitality giant.

### **Part 1: Inception and Core Purpose**

1.  **The Founder and the Name's Origin:** The company's story begins with an investor named Kirk Kerkorian, who had a strong connection to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film studio, a company he acquired a controlling stake in back in 1969.
2.  **Official Founding:** The present company was formally founded in 1986 as Grand Name Co., a subsidiary of Kerkorian's corporation, and launched its operations in 1987 as MGM Grand, Inc.
3.  **The Original Goal:** The initial purpose was to tap into the rapidly expanding entertainment and hospitality sector by developing and managing large-scale hotels and casinos, primarily in the burgeoning market of Las Vegas, Nevada.
4.  **A Bigger Vision:** Over time, the company's goal evolved from just being a casino business to a belief that they exist to "ENTERTAIN THE HUMAN RACE," shifting their focus to offering a diverse portfolio of guest experiences.

***

### **Part 2: Key Milestones and The Shift in Strategy**

1.  **An Iconic Debut:** A major milestone was the opening of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1993, which was, at the time, touted as the world's largest hotel and casino.
2.  **Major Acquisitions:** To expand rapidly and secure a leading market position, the company acquired Mirage Resorts in 2000, becoming "MGM MIRAGE," which significantly increased its portfolio of luxury properties.
3.  **The Transformative Rebrand:** In 2010, the company changed its name to **MGM Resorts International** to reflect its new global focus and its increasingly diverse business portfolio beyond just Las Vegas.
4.  **The Integrated Resort Model (An Innovation):** MGM pioneered the "integrated resort" model, which means intentionally blending high-end casinos with world-class, non-gaming attractions like luxury hotels, fine dining, retail, and major entertainment shows.
5.  **Diversifying Revenue:** This new model was a crucial innovation, as the growth in revenue from non-gaming sources (like lodging, food, and retail) began to outpace traditional gaming receipts, making the company less dependent on just its casino tables.

***

### **Part 3: Headwinds (Problems) and Innovative Solutions**

| Headwind (Challenge) | Innovative Solution That Worked |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Disunity (Post-2000 Merger)** | The company launched a "sweeping strategic and cultural transformation" to unify operations, which had been competing against each other, creating a single vision for growth. |
| **The 2008 Global Financial Crisis** | MGM quickly implemented "Project Evolve," a massive cost-cutting and discipline strategy that helped the company survive potential bankruptcy and streamlined its internal operations. |
| **The Need for Financial Flexibility** | The company created an innovative business structure by forming a controlled real estate investment trust (REIT) called MGM Growth Properties, which allowed MGM to sell and then lease back its real estate assets, providing a flexible way to fund new projects. |
| **Dependence on Physical Casinos** | MGM launched **BetMGM**, a 50/50 venture focused on online gaming and sports betting, positioning the company to capture the growing digital market and expand its reach beyond its physical locations. |
| **Major Economic Downturns (like the COVID-19 pandemic)** | As leisure travel and spending declined (revenue dropped over 50% in 2020), the company’s diversified structure and digital focus allowed it to pivot resources and adapt to new health and safety regulations. |
| **Cybersecurity Threats (Recent Problem)** | In response to a significant cyberattack, MGM took swift action by temporarily disabling certain vulnerable digital systems to mitigate further damage and protect customer data. |

***

### **Part 4: Tailwinds (Favorable Factors) and Current Goal**

1.  **Tailwind: Global Expansion and New Markets:** The successful expansion into international markets, particularly with its integrated resort in Macau (China), gave MGM access to the world's largest gaming market and helped diversify its geographical revenue streams.
2.  **Tailwind: Changing Public Acceptance of Gaming:** A significant tailwind has been the increasing legalization and acceptance of sports betting and online gambling in the United States, which the company capitalized on through the BetMGM platform.
3.  **Tailwind: Experience Economy:** The public's growing preference for high-quality, memorable experiences over simple material goods has favored MGM's strategy of offering luxurious hotels, top-tier dining, state-of-the-art conference spaces, and world-class entertainment.
4.  **Current Goal:** Today, MGM Resorts International's goal is to be the leader in the global entertainment and hospitality industry. They continue to pursue targeted international growth, like the development of an integrated resort in Japan, while constantly strengthening their digital capabilities to enhance customer loyalty.

## Moat Analysis

MGM Resorts International (MGM) has built its competitive advantage, or "moat," primarily through a combination of prime real estate, iconic luxury brands, a powerful customer loyalty system, and strategic investments in digital technology. These factors make it a formidable and difficult company to displace.

### **Analysis of MGM's Moat and Differentiation**

#### **1. Structural Moat: Location and Capital Intensity**

*   **Prime, Irreplaceable Real Estate:** The most significant and hardest-to-replicate part of MGM's moat is its vast portfolio of iconic, large-scale resorts, particularly its commanding presence on the Las Vegas Strip.
*   **High Barriers to Entry:** The casino and integrated resort business is extremely capital-intensive, meaning a competitor needs massive capital for land acquisition, construction, and obtaining complex and scarce gaming licenses (e.g., in Macau, or future markets like Japan and New York).
*   **Difficult to Displace:** Because of the huge cost and time required to build an equivalent portfolio of assets in the same prime locations, it is not easy for a new competitor, even one with significant capital, to displace MGM overnight.

#### **2. Differentiation and Pricing Power**

*   **Premium Brand Portfolio:** MGM owns high-end, iconic brands like the Bellagio and MGM Grand that attract a premium clientele, which drives both gaming and non-gaming revenue.
*   **Pricing Power through Experience:** The company enhances its pricing power by continually upgrading properties, offering high-end luxury experiences, and focusing on non-gaming amenities like celebrity chef restaurants, world-class entertainment, and convention space.
*   **Geographic Diversification:** A key difference from some domestic competitors (like Caesars) is its established and growing international footprint in regulated, high-growth markets like Macau, and its planned mega-resort in Osaka, Japan.

#### **3. Customer Stickiness and Network Effects**

*   **The MGM Rewards Loyalty Program:** The company uses its extensive portfolio of properties to create a powerful internal network effect through its loyalty program, MGM Rewards (formerly M Life).
*   **Recurrinig Business Model:** This program encourages customers to spend their money at an MGM property, whether it is for gaming, dining, or a hotel stay, across a wide network of resorts, fostering sticky and recurring visits.
*   **Expanded Network Effect:** MGM strategically partnered with Marriott Bonvoy, allowing loyalty members to connect their accounts and access rewards at over 10,000 properties worldwide, significantly expanding the value and reach of the MGM Rewards network.

#### **4. Past Strategy and Continuous Innovation**

*   **From Gaming to Entertainment (The Reason for Growth):** Historically, MGM grew by pivoting its strategy from being solely focused on casino-centric assets to creating "integrated resorts" that are showcases of entertainment, dining, and hospitality.
*   **Digital Transformation as "R&D":** While not traditional manufacturing "R&D," MGM is making significant, continuous investment in modern technology—estimated at around \$1.0 billion in 2023 for its information and communication technology (ICT) spending—to maintain its edge.
*   **Constant Innovation is Required:** The company is actively integrating emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and gamification into its operations, which is necessary to deliver personalized, modern customer experiences and improve efficiency in the highly competitive hospitality sector.

5.  **New York Regional Expansion (Empire City).**
    MGM secured a key local approval to potentially expand its Empire City Casino in Yonkers, New York, which would allow it to introduce popular offerings like table games and sports betting, significantly increasing its earning potential at that property.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

## Management Record

This analysis focuses on the management of MGM Resorts International (MGM), with a focus on details relevant to an investor.

### **Current CEO and Management Team**

1.  **CEO Background and Tenure:** William J. Hornbuckle serves as the Chief Executive Officer and President, appointed to the role in March 2020 after the retirement of his predecessor. Hornbuckle is a long-standing veteran of the gaming industry, having been with MGM for over two decades, including previous roles such as President since 2012 and Chief Operating Officer.
2.  **Executive Team Depth:** The management team includes seasoned executives like Jonathan Halkyard (CFO), who has a long history in the hospitality and gaming industry, including a 13-year tenure at Caesars.
3.  **Recent Key Leadership Changes:** The company recently appointed Ayesha Molino, a company veteran and former U.S. Senate Chief Counsel, as Chief Operating Officer, effective in January 2026, succeeding the retiring Corey Sanders. Gary Fritz was also named Chief Commercial Officer and President of MGM Digital to unify the company's digital, gaming, and marketing divisions, highlighting a focus on iGaming growth.

### **Track Record and Key Strategic Decisions**

4.  **COVID-19 and Operational Management:** Hornbuckle's leadership successfully navigated the company through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, including property closures and restricted reopenings.
5.  **Asset-Light Strategy (REITs):** A major capital allocation decision was the successful execution of the sale of MGM Growth Properties (MGP) to Vici Properties, which furthered the company's asset-light model.
6.  **Strategic Acquisitions:** The management team also oversaw significant inorganic growth by acquiring the remaining stake in CityCenter and completing the acquisition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.
7.  **Digital/Sports Betting Expansion:** Management has driven the creation and growth of **BetMGM**, a 50/50 venture that has positioned MGM for expansion into the U.S. sports betting and online gaming markets.

### **Shareholder Value and Performance**

8.  **Recent Growth Metrics:** The company has recently demonstrated strong operational performance; one 2024 analysis noted that Earnings Per Share (EPS) grew by 66% annually over three years, with a single-year revenue growth of 23%.
9.  **Total Shareholder Return (TSR):** While one 2024 analysis indicated a 4.4% total shareholder return over three years alongside significant EPS growth, a similar analysis from 2025 noted a 23% shareholder loss over the prior three years, indicating mixed historical stock performance relative to its earnings growth.
10. **Compensation Structure:** The CEO’s compensation is largely performance-tied, with a relatively small portion from base salary, and his total pay is generally above the industry median for comparable companies. The CEO also holds a significant direct stake in the company's stock, which aligns his interests with shareholder success.

### **Former CEO and Leadership Transition**

11. **Former CEO Transition:** Jim Murren, who served as Chairman and CEO from 2008, informed the Board in February 2020 that he would step down prior to his contract's expiration, with the Board initiating a search for his successor.
12. **Murren's Legacy:** Murren's tenure was marked by the development of the CityCenter destination and his instrumental role in bringing professional sports, such as the NHL's Golden Knights and the NFL's Raiders, to Las Vegas. The transition to Hornbuckle, a long-term internal executive, provided continuity, especially as the company faced the onset of the pandemic.

### **Future Strategy and Vision**

13. **Digital and iGaming Focus:** A core part of the future strategy is the continued expansion of its digital gaming and sports betting strategy through BetMGM, with the goal of becoming a leading "entertainment-related gaming company."
14. **Global Expansion:** The company is pursuing targeted international expansion, notably through the integrated resort opportunity in Japan (Osaka).
15. **Customer-Centricity:** Management has articulated a vision to shift more toward customer-centricity, specifically focusing on the higher end of the business to ensure premium service and experiences.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of MGM Resorts International's (MGM) management incentive and compensation is based on disclosures in its recent proxy statements (DEF 14A).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Stock Ownership Guidelines:** MGM has formal stock ownership guidelines for directors and officers, and non-management directors were compliant with or on track to comply with these guidelines. This mechanism encourages a long-term, shareholder-like perspective from the company's leadership.
2.  **CEO's Direct Ownership:** The CEO, Bill Hornbuckle, directly owns 0.23% of the company's shares, which, while appearing low, represents a significant personal investment and aligns his financial interests with stock appreciation.
3.  **Conclusion on Ownership:** The presence of stock ownership requirements suggests a structural commitment to aligning management's interests with those of shareholders, as a portion of their wealth is directly tied to the company's stock performance.

#### **Compensation Structure**

4.  **Equity-Heavy Pay Structure:** Executive compensation is heavily weighted toward equity and performance-based incentives, not just base salary. For the CEO, approximately 87.4% of the total compensation is composed of bonuses, including company stock and options.
5.  **Performance-Based Equity:** The long-term incentive plan includes Performance Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) for named executive officers, with an executive's annual equity grant often being 50% PSUs. PSUs only pay out if specific multi-year performance targets are met, directly linking a large portion of pay to long-term shareholder value creation.
6.  **Performance Metrics:** The annual and long-term incentives are tied to key operational and strategic performance metrics, such as Adjusted Property EBITDAR (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent) for core operations and specific targets like BetMGM Adjusted EBITDA for the digital business. Tying compensation to these specific financial results drives management to focus on profitability and strategic growth areas.
7.  **Deferred Compensation for High Performance:** For certain executives, annual bonus amounts exceeding 150% of the target are payable in fully vested Deferred Restricted Stock Units (DRSUs), which are then paid out in three equal annual installments. This encourages sustained outperformance and incentivizes a focus beyond a single fiscal year.

#### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

8.  **Incentivized for Shareholder Interests:** The compensation structure is strongly designed to act in the interest of shareholders. The high proportion of performance-based equity (PSUs, RSUs, DRSUs) means management only realizes the majority of their potential pay if the stock price appreciates and pre-determined financial/operational targets are met over multiple years.
9.  **Mitigation of Self-Serving Behavior:** The reliance on long-term equity awards, in conjunction with mandatory stock ownership guidelines, significantly limits the incentive for management to "line their own pockets" through short-sighted decisions, as doing so would jeopardize their future equity value.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for MGM rests on its successful transformation from a reliable but slow-growing physical casino operator into a dominant global entertainment and digital gaming giant. In the near term, the most important driver is financial discipline: management's aggressive cost-cutting measures, combined with heavy share buybacks, will boost earnings per share. Critically, the massive financial drain from its digital sports betting platform, BetMGM, is expected to end by 2025 as it becomes profitable. Once this drag is removed, the core profitability of MGM's irreplaceable physical properties (especially the high-demand Las Vegas Strip and recovering Macau assets) will shine through. In the long term, revenue growth will accelerate from two major new engines: securing a highly profitable, full casino license in New York (Empire City) and the development of the massive integrated resort in Osaka, Japan. These growth drivers, combined with the strength of its loyalty program and strong management, suggest the stock is undervalued relative to its future earnings potential.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The overall U.S. and global economy avoids a significant recession, ensuring consumers continue to prioritize discretionary spending on travel, entertainment, and luxury experiences. The BetMGM digital platform successfully achieves and maintains positive profitability (positive EBITDA) by 2025, as promised by management. Major international expansion projects, particularly the Osaka, Japan resort and the New York casino license upgrade (Empire City), are completed and begin generating significant revenue without major delays or unforeseen regulatory obstacles. Geopolitical stability allows MGM China operations in Macau to continue their strong recovery trend.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws, execution risks, and challenges to the core assumptions presented in the long thesis for MGM Resorts International.

### Bear Case: Holes and Faults in the MGM Long Thesis

#### **Critique of Key Growth Drivers and Timelines**

1.  **New York Casino (Empire City) License is Not Guaranteed and Delayed:** The thesis overstates the certainty of securing a highly profitable, full commercial casino license in New York. MGM is one of eight strong bidders vying for a maximum of three licenses, making a successful outcome speculative and highly competitive. Furthermore, even if the license is awarded, the proposed $2.3 billion expansion and the resulting full revenue generation are not anticipated until **mid-2029**, which is too far out to be a near-term or medium-term catalyst.

2.  **Osaka, Japan Resort Faces Significant Delays and Cost Risks:** The assumption of a massive, smoothly executed resort is flawed, as the project has already been delayed, with the projected opening pushed back to **2030**. The project faces a request from Expo 2025 organizers for a potential six-month construction pause, which could delay the opening further, into 2031, and increase the already high $9.1 billion development cost.

3.  **BetMGM Profitability is a Price-In Event, Not a Future Catalyst:** The expected end of the "massive financial drain from BetMGM" by 2025 is largely an achieved or priced-in event, not a future driver of re-rating, as the platform has already achieved positive EBITDA and significantly raised its 2025 guidance to at least $150 million. The risk shifts to its ability to maintain a competitive "podium position" and achieve its ambitious long-term $500 million EBITDA target in a highly promotional and competitive market against larger rivals.

#### **Critique of Financial Strategy and Core Asset Strength**

4.  **EPS Boost from Buybacks Masks Operational Weakness:** The focus on earnings per share (EPS) improvement via **heavy share buybacks** (reducing share count by 45% since 2021) is a non-operational boost that can mask underlying core earnings challenges. Recent operational results showed mixed performance, including a year-over-year decline in consolidated net revenues in Q1 2025 and a slight dip in Las Vegas EBITDAR in Q2 2025, suggesting organic growth remains volatile.

5.  **Vulnerability to Geopolitical Tensions in Macau is Rising:** The assumption of "geopolitical stability" for the Macau recovery is tenuous, as escalating US-China trade tensions, including the US adding Macau to a "foreign adversary" list, are forcing analysts to price in an increased risk premium on MGM's Macau exposure. A weakening Chinese economy and persistent regulatory risk also pose an ongoing threat to the sustained recovery of gaming revenues.

#### **Critique of Macroeconomic Assumptions**

6.  **U.S. Consumer Discretionary Spending is Slowing:** The core assumption that the U.S. and global economy avoids a significant recession is challenged by recent data showing a slowdown in broader consumer discretionary spending, particularly on optional services like travel and recreation, which directly impacts the Las Vegas Strip. While high-end consumer spending has been resilient, a weakening labor market and elevated uncertainty are expected to pressure real disposable income growth into mid-2026.

7.  **Las Vegas Strip Visitation is Softening:** The supposed "irreplaceable strength" of the Las Vegas Strip properties is experiencing headwinds, with overall visitation showing declines. Recent Strip gaming revenue has been highly dependent on volatile high-end baccarat play, indicating mixed underlying metrics and a potential return to pre-pandemic seasonal softness that could persist into 2026.

---

## Next Steps

This is a very comprehensive analysis. The core debate—leverage risk versus growth potential from Macau and digital gaming—is clearly established.

The next steps should focus on quantifying the largest risks and validating the valuation, which are currently the most significant blind spots in the analysis.

### Next Steps and Unanswered Questions to Investigate

1.  **Quantify the Financial Leverage and Risk**
    *   Investigate the current **Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA** ratio and benchmark it against peers like Caesars (CZR) and Wynn (WYNN). The high debt-to-equity is mentioned as a concern, but without the key leverage ratio, the risk is unquantifiable. *The current Debt/EBITDA ratios appear high, ranging from 6.1x to 17.89x depending on the metric and date used, which validates the high-debt concern.*
    *   Determine the average **interest rate and maturity schedule** on its debt obligations to assess sensitivity to interest rate changes and future refinancing risk, especially given the high debt levels reported.

2.  **Validate the "Undervalued" Thesis with Comparative Valuation**
    *   Determine the current **Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)** multiple for MGM and compare it to its historical average (median EV/EBITDA was 13.07 over 13 years, but the trailing 12 months is reported as 17.89x to 16.3x) and to the multiples of main competitors, as the Long Thesis assumes the stock is undervalued.
    *   Research the analyst consensus target price versus the current price and identify the key operating assumptions (Macau recovery, BetMGM EBITDA) that justify the target price.

3.  **Deep Dive into Core Asset Performance and Consumer Segmentation**
    *   Clarify the nature of the Las Vegas Strip "softness" by seeking recent non-gaming metrics like **hotel occupancy rate and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)** year-over-year growth. *Recent Q2 data showed occupancy at 97% and RevPAR up, but this may mask a softening mass-market trend.*
    *   Find the internal breakdown of Las Vegas revenue or EBITDAR between **non-gaming (rooms/convention/food)** and **gaming** to test the "integrated resort" moat and see which segment is truly driving/dragging growth.

4.  **Quantify Geopolitical and Macau Risk**
    *   Identify the explicit **EBITDA contribution from MGM China** as a percentage of consolidated results, which the bear case argues is a rising risk premium. *The company's EBITDAR breakdown has been around 59% from the Las Vegas Strip, low 20s from regional properties, and 21% from Macau in 2024, demonstrating its significance.*
    *   Research any specific, recent regulations or geopolitical events (e.g., changes to VIP junket scrutiny or US trade actions) that have materially impacted Macau casino operators *since* the last earnings call.

5.  **Evaluate Digital Gaming Market Share and Competition**
    *   Search for recent data (within the last 6 months) on BetMGM's estimated **online gaming and sports betting market share** across key U.S. states to check if they are successfully maintaining their 'podium position' against DraftKings and FanDuel, a critical risk raised in the bear case.
    *   Look for any updated guidance on the timeline for the **$500 million long-term EBITDA target** for BetMGM to validate its long-term growth potential and compare it to the expected profitability of its main competitors.
