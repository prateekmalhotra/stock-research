### 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projection

Trelleborg's business engine is driven by its strategy to maintain leading positions in selected high-margin niches through operational excellence (organic growth) and continuous bolt-on acquisitions (structural growth) in its three core business areas: Sealing Solutions, Medical Solutions, and Industrial Solutions. [cite: 6 from step 2, 7]

**Engine Components and Rationale:**

| Metric | Q1-Q3 2025 Performance | Future Assumption (2026-2030) | Justification/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organic Growth** | Mixed: +4% (Q3), -1% (Q2), +1% (Q1) | **2.0%** | Conservative: Reflects a blend of global economic uncertainty and the strength in niche areas like aerospace and medical solutions, which saw significant growth. [cite: 3 from step 3] |
| **Structural/M&A Growth**| Positive: +3% (Q3), +6% (Q2), +6% (Q1) | **1.0%** | Very Conservative: Management emphasizes continued value-creating bolt-on acquisitions. We project a significantly lower, but sustained, rate to reflect caution and integration risk. |
| **Total Annual Revenue Growth** | N/A | **3.0%** (2.0% Organic + 1.0% M&A) | This is below the company's long-term target of >8% total sales growth, ensuring a conservative valuation. |

**2025 Full Year Baseline Revenue (SEK M):**
*   9M 2025 Sales: SEK 8,866 M (Q1) + 8,551 M (Q2) + 8,532 M (Q3) = 25,949 M. [cite: 3 from step 3]
*   Q4 2025 Outlook: Expected "on a par with the third quarter of 2025."
*   **2025 Baseline Revenue (Est.):** 25,949 M + 8,532 M = **34,481 M**

**Revenue Projections (SEK M):**

| Year | Revenue (SEK M) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **34,481** | Baseline Estimate |
| **2026** | 35,515 | 34,481 * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2027** | 36,580 | 35,515 * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2028** | 37,678 | 36,580 * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2029** | 38,808 | 37,678 * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2030** | 39,972 | 38,808 * (1 + 3.0%) |

### 3. Margin, ROIC, and Net Income Projection

#### Margin & Tax Rate
*   **Net Income Margin:** Based on the rolling 12-month EBITA margin (18.2%), and deducting for amortization (SEK 650 M guide) and net financial expenses (approx. SEK 504 M LTM), the estimated pre-tax profit (PBT) margin is approximately 14.9%. With a management-guided underlying tax rate of 25% for 2025, the net income margin is $14.9\% * (1 - 0.25) = 11.175\%$.
*   **Conservative Net Income Margin Assumption:** **11.0%** for all projected years.

#### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
*   The LTM Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), a proxy for ROIC, is 12.0% (excluding items affecting comparability).
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **7.0%**. This is significantly below the historical return to build in a margin of safety and account for slower returns on new investments.

#### Net Income Calculation
The valuation assumes that Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year, which then generates additional income based on the conservative ROIC.

*   $Net\ Income_n = (Revenue_n * Net\ Margin) + (Cash\ at\ Start\ of\ Year_n * ROIC)$
*   $Cash\ at\ Start\ of\ Year_{n+1} = Cash\ at\ Start\ of\ Year_n + Net\ Income_n$
*   $Cash\ at\ Start\ of\ Year_{2026} = 1,879 M$

| Year | Revenue (SEK M) | Net Margin | Base NI (A) (SEK M) | Cash at Start (B) (SEK M) | ROIC | Income from Cash (C) (SEK M) | Net Income (A+C) (SEK M) | Cash at End (B+NI) (SEK M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 34,481 | 11.0% | 3,793 | 1,879 | 7.0% | 132 | **3,925** | 5,804 |
| **2026** | 35,515 | 11.0% | 3,907 | 5,804 | 7.0% | 406 | **4,313** | 10,117 |
| **2027** | 36,580 | 11.0% | 4,024 | 10,117 | 7.0% | 708 | **4,732** | 14,849 |
| **2028** | 37,678 | 11.0% | 4,145 | 14,849 | 7.0% | 1,039 | **5,184** | 20,033 |
| **2029** | 38,808 | 11.0% | 4,269 | 20,033 | 7.0% | 1,402 | **5,671** | 25,704 |
| **2030** | 39,972 | 11.0% | 4,397 | 25,704 | 7.0% | 1,799 | **6,196** | 31,900 |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### Discount and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **8.0%**. A conservative rate for a global industrial company, higher than historical cost of capital, to reflect current geopolitical/macroeconomic risk.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (TGR):** **2.0%**. A very conservative perpetuity growth rate, well below long-term global GDP expectations, appropriate for a mature, cyclical industrial manufacturer.

**Terminal Value Calculation (based on 2030 Net Income):**
$$
\text{Terminal Value (TV)}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{TGR})}{\text{WACC} - \text{TGR}}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value (TV)}_{2030} = \frac{6,196 \text{ M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.08 - 0.02} = \frac{6,320 \text{ M}}{0.06} = 105,333 \text{ M SEK}
$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (SEK M):**

| Year | Net Income (SEK M) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Discounted Value (SEK M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 3,925 | $1 / (1.08)^1$ = 0.9259 | 3,634 |
| **2026** | 4,313 | $1 / (1.08)^2$ = 0.8573 | 3,698 |
| **2027** | 4,732 | $1 / (1.08)^3$ = 0.7938 | 3,757 |
| **2028** | 5,184 | $1 / (1.08)^4$ = 0.7350 | 3,810 |
| **2029** | 5,671 | $1 / (1.08)^5$ = 0.6806 | 3,859 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | 105,333 | $1 / (1.08)^6$ = 0.6302 | 66,380 |
| | | | |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **85,138 M SEK** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

The fair value of equity is calculated by taking the Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows, adding the current cash, and subtracting the current total debt.

| Metric | Value (SEK M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | 85,138 M |
| **Add: Total Cash (TC)** | 1,879 M |
| **Subtract: Total Debt (TD)** | (10,159 M) |
| **Total Equity Fair Value (SEK)** | **76,858 M SEK** |

**Fair Value Per Share (SEK):**
$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share (SEK)} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Fair Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{76,858 \text{ M SEK}}{241,547,186 \text{ shares}} = \mathbf{317.85 \text{ SEK}}
$$

**Fair Value Per Share (USD):**
$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share (USD)} = \text{Fair Value Per Share (SEK)} \times \text{FX Rate}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share (USD)} = 317.85 \text{ SEK} \times 0.104 \text{ USD/SEK} = \mathbf{\$33.06}
$$

### 6. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (TBABF)** | **$33.06** |
| **Current Market Price (TBABF)** | **$37.83** |
| **Difference** | **-12.5%** |

#### Justification of Valuation Assumptions

1.  **Revenue Growth (3.0%):** The 3.0% total growth (2.0% organic, 1.0% M&A) is extremely conservative for a company that is actively acquiring and targeting niche growth in high-growth sectors like aerospace and medical, which have driven recent performance. This conservatism is the primary factor in the valuation being lower than the market price.
2.  **Net Income Margin (11.0%):** This margin is a conservative estimate derived from the LTM EBITA margin of 18.2% and an application of the 25% tax rate. The underlying assumption is that Trelleborg will maintain its operational efficiency and strong pricing power despite global economic uncertainty.
3.  **ROIC (7.0%):** The assumed ROIC of 7.0% is significantly lower than the historical ROCE of 12.0%. This conservatively depresses future earnings by assuming a less efficient deployment of retained earnings than the company has historically achieved.
4.  **Discount Rate (WACC of 8.0%) and Terminal Growth (2.0%):** The 8.0% WACC is a prudent choice, and the 2.0% TGR is a low, conservative assumption for a global market leader, indicating little long-term real growth expectation.

#### Market Interpretation of the Discrepancy

The fair value of **$33.06** is **12.5% lower** than the current market price of **$37.83**.

The market is making a clear set of assumptions that are more optimistic than this conservative valuation:

1.  **Higher Growth Expectation:** The market likely believes that Trelleborg will exceed the conservative 3.0% total sales growth. The company's internal target is >8% growth, and recent structural growth has been as high as 6%. The market is likely pricing in a total growth rate closer to **4.5% - 5.0%**, driven by a greater pace of M&A and stronger organic recovery in core markets, especially if the geopolitical and economic outlook improves.
2.  **Sustained M&A Premiums:** The market is likely giving full credit to the value-accretive nature of Trelleborg's bolt-on M&A strategy, assuming the company can sustain a high rate of value creation from acquisitions, resulting in faster deleveraging and better earnings per share growth through the continuing share buyback program.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower WACC, perhaps closer to **7.0%-7.5%**, reflecting Trelleborg's strong balance sheet, solid cash flow generation (92% LTM cash conversion), and a more optimistic long-term risk assessment for the industrial sector.
4.  **Higher ROIC/Cash Efficiency:** The market is likely assuming a reinvestment efficiency closer to the company's historical **12.0% ROCE**, rather than the conservative 7.0% used here, which significantly impacts the compounding of future earnings.

In summary, the market's price reflects a belief in Trelleborg's ability to capitalize on its high-margin niche strategy and a higher rate of future M&A, whereas this valuation purposely uses conservative estimates for all growth and reinvestment metrics, leading to the modest undervaluation indicated.
