## Business Summary

Volato operates in the private aviation sector, primarily offering fractional jet ownership and jet card programs to wealthy individuals and corporations across North America. The company focuses on utilizing the efficient HondaJet fleet. The core business model involves customers purchasing a fraction (a share) of an airplane, which grants them guaranteed flight access without the burden of full ownership. Customers pay Volato an initial capital investment, mandatory monthly management fees, and an hourly rate only for the time the jet is actually flying, generating stable recurring revenue. Services are concentrated on high-demand routes connecting major financial and leisure hubs, especially on the East Coast of the United States.

---

## Business Model Risk

The primary risk for Volato is that private jet travel is a luxury service highly sensitive to economic conditions. If there is an economic downturn, wealthy customers typically reduce their flying hours or hesitate to purchase new fractional shares, immediately hurting revenue. This cyclical threat has historically plagued the private aviation industry, such as during the 2008 recession, and is a current concern due to high interest rates potentially slowing down high-net-worth spending. A near-term risk involves high operating expenses; specifically, volatile jet fuel prices and the increasing cost and shortage of experienced pilots and maintenance staff can severely cut into Volato’s profit margins. Lastly, the market is intensely competitive, requiring Volato to constantly manage pricing against larger rivals who might offer greater flexibility in aircraft types, threatening Volato's ability to achieve long-term market share growth.

## Company History

The history of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) is a story of a private aviation company that began as an operator but strategically pivoted to become a technology and services platform.

### **History of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR): Inception to Present**

#### **The Founding and Core Mission (2021)**

1.  **Inception:** Volato Group, Inc. was officially founded in January 2021 by co-founders Matthew D. Liotta and Nicholas Cooper.
2.  **The Vision (Why it was founded):** The company was established to disrupt the traditional private jet market by creating a more transparent, flexible, and accessible alternative to both full ownership and old-school charter services.
3.  **The Original Model:** Volato's initial business revolved around an innovative fractional ownership program, primarily utilizing a fleet of modern, efficient HondaJet light aircraft.

#### **Innovative Solutions and Business Model**

4.  **Fractional Ownership Innovation:** The core offering allowed customers to buy a share of a jet, which is standard, but Volato added a unique revenue-sharing element. This program shares flight revenue with the owner when their plane is chartered out, which helps offset the high cost of ownership.
5.  **Focus on Specific Aircraft:** By concentrating on the light jet segment, particularly the HondaJet, the company was able to build specialized operational expertise and cater efficiently to shorter to medium-haul trips.
6.  **The Technology Engine:** Recognizing the need for efficiency, the company developed its own proprietary cloud-based software called **Mission Control** to streamline complex daily tasks like flight scheduling, customer management, and crew coordination.

#### **Tailwinds: Fortunate External Factors**

7.  **The Pandemic-Era Private Aviation Boom:** Volato launched during a significant surge in demand for private air travel, as individuals sought to avoid the crowds and health concerns of commercial flights.
8.  **Strong Aircraft Partnership:** The company was able to secure a major firm order for 23 HondaJets in 2023, ensuring a strong, consistent supply of new, fuel-efficient aircraft to support its rapid expansion efforts.

#### **Headwinds: Problems and Challenges**

9.  **The Challenge of Capital and Scale:** As a rapidly growing company, Volato faced significant financial challenges, specifically managing high liabilities and navigating a complex capital structure.
10. **Operational Complexity:** Operating its own fleet required holding an FAA Part 135 air carrier certificate, which involved substantial overhead, regulatory compliance, and logistical stress, limiting its ability to scale quickly.
11. **Market Risks:** Like all aviation companies, Volato also faced the risk of customer dissatisfaction, as issues like service interruptions or aircraft availability can be outside the company's direct control.

#### **The Strategic Pivot and Current Goal (The Innovation that Worked)**

12. **Focusing on the High-Growth Core (2024-2025):** Volato made a pivotal decision to move away from being a heavy asset-based operator to focus almost exclusively on its most scalable and profitable technology and service platforms.
13. **Outsourcing the Flying:** In mid-2025, the company completed the sale of its air carrier subsidiary, which held its operating certificate, a move that shifted the operational costs and risks of flying to third-party operators.
14. **Current Goal: A Tech-First Aviation Platform:** Volato's current mission is to be a next-generation aviation company by commercializing its software, **Mission Control**, and growing its experiential travel platform, **Vaunt**, which connects travelers with available private flights.
15. **A Unique Monetization Strategy:** The company also announced a patent-pending technology to install specialized hardware on aircraft to use excess power and capacity to generate new revenue through Bitcoin mining, turning underutilized resources into valuable digital assets.
16. **Financial Stability:** They proactively tackled their financial headwinds by reporting significant debt reduction in 2025 through cash management and negotiated settlements, which helped strengthen their balance sheet and drive near-term profitability.

## Moat Analysis

Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) has built its business moat primarily through an innovative, customer-centric fractional ownership model and its operational focus on a specific, efficient aircraft, which is then enhanced by proprietary technology.

Here is an analysis of Volato's moat and differentiators:

### **1. Special Position and Product Differentiation**

*   **Niche Fleet Focus:** Volato built its brand and operations around being the largest operator of the **HondaJet** in the United States. This aircraft is highly differentiated—it is the fastest and highest-flying in its class, offers superior fuel efficiency, and has a unique over-the-wing engine mount that results in a larger, quieter cabin.
*   **Targeting the Core Market:** The company's strategy is to efficiently serve the vast majority of private jet missions, as about 70% of all private flights involve four passengers or fewer, which is the perfect capacity for the HondaJet. This specialization gives Volato a cost advantage for these common, shorter-range trips.
*   **Exclusive Full-Mission Solution:** Volato is the only provider in the U.S. to offer fractional ownership of the super-midsize **Gulfstream G280**, which complements its HondaJet fleet for longer, coast-to-coast flights and bigger groups. This allows them to be a single-source provider for nearly all of a client's travel needs.

### **2. Pricing Power and Unique Fractional Model**

*   **Innovative Revenue-Share Model:** Volato’s fractional ownership program is uniquely structured to allow owners to receive a share of the charter revenue earned when their aircraft is flown by other clients. This revenue share helps to offset the owner’s monthly operating costs, which is a major financial differentiator from typical timeshare models where you "use it or lose it."
*   **Simplified, Predictable Pricing:** The company eliminates all **repositioning charges** (ferry fees) for flights within the continental U.S., which are often an unexpected and significant cost for private fliers with competitors. This simplicity and predictability create a high value proposition.
*   **Guaranteed Performance:** They offer a **guaranteed minimum revenue share** for new fractional aircraft, ensuring a predictable floor for the financial performance of the owner's asset.

### **3. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue**

*   **Sticky, Recurring Contracts:** Fractional ownership involves the high cost and commitment of purchasing a share of a new jet, which locks in customers for a multi-year term (typically five years) before the jet is sold. This capital commitment, combined with the recurring monthly management and flight fees, ensures a high degree of customer stickiness.
*   **Platform-Driven Recurring Revenue:** The company has created a separate subscription-based platform called **Vaunt**, which connects travelers to empty legs (flights returning to base) and other available private flights. The growth of this platform, which is building durable, recurring subscription revenue, adds another layer of financial stability outside of the core fractional sales.

### **4. Moat Creation, Technology, and Displacement Risk**

*   **Proprietary Technology (R&D):** Volato views itself as a "technology-first" aviation company and invests in proprietary software like **Mission Control**, which is a cloud-based platform for internal operational efficiency, streamlining critical functions like flight scheduling and crew management. This focus on software provides a necessary operational edge that competitors would have to replicate.
*   **Beginning of a Network Effect:** The **Vaunt** platform for on-demand travel is actively expanding its network of operators and has seen rising member engagement and app downloads. As more operators and travelers join the platform, its utility and value increase for everyone, creating a basic two-sided network effect that makes it harder for a competitor to displace.
*   **Displacement by Capital:** While Volato's unique contract structure and specific fleet expertise offer a strong defense, it operates in a capital-intensive industry. A major, well-capitalized competitor *could* enter the market, purchase a large fleet of HondaJets, and try to replicate Volato's revenue-share model. However, they would still face the challenge of replicating Volato's proprietary operational software and the pre-existing, long-term contractual relationships with current fractional owners.
*   **Driver of Growth:** The company's initial, rapid growth was driven by two main factors: entering the market with its differentiated HondaJet model at the impeccable time of a **post-pandemic surge** in private aviation demand, and subsequently gaining capital and transparency through its public listing to rapidly accelerate fleet expansion.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) revolve around a major strategic pivot, financial de-risking, and the growth of its technology platforms. The company is actively transforming from a pure-play private aviation company into a technology and *critical minerals* focused entity through an announced merger.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)**

1.  **Closing of the M2i Global Merger.** This all-stock merger, which is on track for a Q4 2025 close, will transform Volato into a company focused on the critical minerals market. The completion of this strategic shift could generate investor attention and a re-evaluation of the company's value, moving it beyond its current private aviation valuation.
2.  **Sustained Profitability and Debt Reduction.** The company achieved positive net income in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025, and management is guiding for consistent profitability in Q3 and Q4 2025. This improved financial discipline, including a significant year-to-date debt reduction of over $50 million, strengthens the balance sheet and enhances financial flexibility.
3.  **Revenue Contribution from Aircraft Sales.** The scheduled delivery of an additional Gulfstream G280 in Q4 2025 is expected to contribute incremental revenue and margin, especially as year-end is a strong period for business aviation sales.
4.  **Growth in the Vaunt Subscription Platform.** The "experiential private aviation platform" Vaunt is a growing source of subscription sales, with Q3 2025 subscription sales projected for 35% to 50% sequential growth.

***

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)**

1.  **Post-Merger Focus on Critical Minerals.** The completed merger with M2i Global, Inc. will fundamentally change Volato's core business to focus on the exploration and development of critical mineral deposits. This move shifts the long-term growth narrative into a new, potentially high-growth industrial sector.
2.  **Expansion of Technology and Software Offerings.** Management is focusing on software initiatives, including the proprietary **Mission Control** software and the newly launched **Parslee AI** platform for complex document analysis. This pivot toward recurring software and service revenue is expected to drive long-term sustainable growth.
3.  **Financial Strategy to Fund Long-Term Growth.** Chief Financial Officer Mark Heinen explicitly stated that "reducing debt through disciplined execution... frees capital to support recurring software and service revenues that will drive long-term growth." This strategy aims to solidify the company's capital structure for future investment.

***

### **Management's Stated Strategy & Catalysts from Recent Earnings**

*   **CEO Matt Liotta's Strategy (Q1 & Q2 2025):** The CEO highlighted that **"Profitability from continuing operations, major liability reductions, and operational growth across our platforms are all signals that our strategy is working."**
*   **CFO Mark Heinen's Focus (Q3 2025 Update):** The CFO affirmed the strategy by stating, **"Reducing debt through disciplined execution not only stabilizes the company today but also frees capital to support recurring software and service revenues that will drive long-term growth."**
*   **Strategic Pivot Rationale:** Management is concentrating resources on high-growth segments like aircraft sales and software development, exemplified by the agreement to transition fleet operations to flyExclusive (allowing Volato to focus on its software/tech platforms and the M2i merger).

The analysis of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) management focuses on Co-Founder and CEO Matthew Liotta's leadership, the team's strategic pivots, and their recent track record of value creation.

### Management Background and Track Record

1.  **CEO and Co-Founder:** Matthew Dennis Liotta is the Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Volato Group, Inc. He has been a driving force for the company, providing the overarching vision and strategic direction since its inception.
2.  **Prior Entrepreneurial Experience:** Mr. Liotta's background includes founding Agrify (NASDAQ: AGFY) in 2016, an agricultural technology company where he served as President and later Chief Technology Officer. Before that, he held roles at several Silicon Valley venture capital-backed portfolio companies, indicating a focus on tech and growth-oriented ventures.
3.  **Aviation Industry Expertise:** While Mr. Liotta's personal background is tech-focused, the operational management team has deep aviation experience, which is crucial for the business. Executive VP of Fleet Operations, Brian Coulter, is noted as an aviation innovator who was a founder of three air carrier certificates, including JSX, and held key roles at JetBlue Airways.
4.  **Operational Leadership:** Executive Vice President of Fleet Performance, Gary Waldman, brings over 30 years of commercial and private aviation experience, including executive leadership positions at XOJET, JetSuite, and Jet Edge, and co-founding B2B-focused Stellar Labs.

### Key Decisions and Performance

5.  **Strategic Business Model Pivot:** Volato's management made a critical, high-stakes decision to shift from an "asset-heavy" model (fractional ownership, jet cards, operating their own fleet) to an "asset-light," tech-driven model focused on aircraft leasing and proprietary software platforms. This pivot included suspending their fractional and jet card programs to focus on debt repayment and profitability.
6.  **Divestiture of Operating Certificate:** As part of the strategic shift, a major key decision was the sale of the subsidiary GC Aviation, Inc. and its FAA Part 135 air carrier certificate in 2025. CEO Liotta called this a "deliberate move" to focus capital on scalable, high-growth, high-return areas like their tech platforms and leasing models.
7.  **Financial Turnaround and Promise Delivery:** The management team successfully delivered on its promise of a financial turnaround, reporting its first quarterly net profits in years in Q1 and Q2 2025 after a period of struggles. They have been aggressively reducing liabilities, with total liabilities declining by over 68% year-to-date in 2025, strengthening the balance sheet.
8.  **Board Reorganization:** A strategic enhancement of the Board of Directors occurred in April 2024, with four directors stepping down and two new independent directors appointed to introduce expertise in technology and aviation, aiming for a "more nimble board structure" and to "accelerate financial goals."

### Future Strategy and Vision

9.  **Core Future Strategy:** Volato's future vision is to be a technology-focused private aviation company, leveraging its proprietary software, **Mission Control**, for operational efficiency and its experiential travel platform, **Vaunt**, for customer acquisition and market penetration.
10. **Capital-Efficient Revenue:** The primary revenue strategy centers on aircraft leasing (starting with Gulfstream G280s) to third-party charter operators, which is designed to be a capital-efficient structure supporting recurring income. Management anticipates remaining profitable through the rest of 2025.
11. **Transformational Merger:** A significant part of the forward strategy is a planned all-stock merger with M2i Global, Inc. (MTWO) to create a dual-platform growth company focused on critical minerals infrastructure and aviation software. This merger represents a major diversification and a pivotal strategic decision for the company's future.

### Shareholder Value and Popularity

12. **Shareholder Value Delivery:** Historically, the company experienced a period of losses and high debt, but the recent, dramatic shift to profitability and aggressive debt reduction directly demonstrates management's ability to create value by stabilizing the business and improving its financial health in 2025.
13. **CEO's Public Company History (Agrify):** CEO Liotta's prior company, Agrify (AGFY), was incorporated in 2016 and later went public, but subsequently faced significant financial challenges, reported steep revenue declines and losses, and filed for Chapter 11 in 2024, which may raise questions about his long-term track record in a highly competitive market. However, his focus on a tech/SaaS model at both Agrify and Volato is consistent.

## Management Incentive

Based on the review of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) proxy materials, the management's incentives demonstrate a strong, deliberate alignment with shareholder interests, primarily through a heavy reliance on equity and voluntary cash compensation reductions.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

#### 1. Insider Ownership (Higher the Better)

*   **High Insider Stake:** The beneficial ownership of the two largest individual holders who are or were named executive officers/directors—the CEO, Matthew Liotta, and former Chief Commercial Officer, Nicholas Cooper—is substantial.
*   **Shareholder Alignment:** The combined beneficial ownership of just these two individuals (as of December 23, 2024) is approximately 15.05% of the outstanding common stock, which represents a very significant personal stake in the company’s stock performance, aligning their wealth with that of the shareholders.

#### 2. Executive Compensation Structure

*   **Heavy Equity Focus:** The company’s compensation includes long-term incentives such as option awards and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), indicating that a significant portion of the total compensation is tied to the long-term value of the stock, rather than short-term cash awards.
*   **Voluntary Salary Reductions (Cash Conservation):** In June 2024, the named executive officers (NEOs) voluntarily reduced their base salaries as part of cost savings measures. The CEO's annualized salary, for example, was dramatically reduced from $310,000 to $2,400. This extreme measure shows a management team willing to forgo stable cash income to conserve capital and place nearly all their financial incentive on the stock's future appreciation.
*   **Equity Vesting:** The RSU awards vest over time (e.g., 25% after 12 months, and the remainder monthly thereafter), ensuring that executives must remain with the company and its stock must perform over the long term for them to fully realize their compensation.
*   **Independent Oversight:** The Compensation Committee, responsible for overseeing the compensation philosophy and recommending executive pay, is composed entirely of independent directors, which provides a structural check on the pay-setting process.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive

The management of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) appears to have **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

1.  **Alignment with Shareholders:** The voluntary, dramatic reductions in base salaries for executive officers, including the CEO, in favor of a compensation structure heavily weighted toward equity (stock options and RSUs) is a strong indicator of alignment. Their day-to-day work is directly tied to an increase in the company’s stock price.
2.  **Motivation to Grow Value:** The high insider ownership, evidenced by the significant stake of the founding executives, means they personally benefit directly and substantially from long-term capital appreciation, minimizing the incentive to "just line their own pockets" with high cash salaries and short-term bonuses that are disconnected from stock performance.

---

## Price History

The analysis of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) stock price history and technical indicators is as follows.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** As of the last reported closing date, the stock price for Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) was \$2.19. The stock has experienced extreme volatility over the past year, trading in a 52-week range between a low of \$1.14 and a high of \$19.06.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The current stock price of \$2.19 is approximately **92.11%** above its 52-week low of \$1.14. This calculation reflects a substantial recovery from the stock's lowest point within the last year.

3.  **Technical Analysis—Trading Low Assessment:** Based on technical analysis, the stock is currently showing signs of strength and is not fundamentally considered "trading low." Moving Averages (short- and long-term) are issuing "buy signals," and one trading analysis gives an overall "Strong Buy" rating for its technical indicators. However, a key oscillator, the RSI14, suggests the stock is *extremely overbought* (at 77), which can be an early warning for a potential short-term correction.

4.  **Significant Stock Movement (Up Bigly):** The stock has experienced a significant increase in recent months, climbing by over 56% since a pivot bottom identified in late August 2025. In the two weeks leading up to the price data, the stock was up by more than 35%.

5.  **Reasons for Recent Price Increase:** This recent upward trend is tied to positive company announcements, including updates on continued progress, consistent profitability, and debt reduction in Q3 2025. Additionally, news of a pending merger with M2i Global and projected high sequential growth (35% to 50%) for its Vaunt subscription platform likely fueled investor optimism.

---

## Long Thesis

Volato's bull case is centered on its strategic transformation from a risky, asset-heavy private jet operator into a profitable, asset-light technology platform, coupled with a massive long-term pivot into the critical minerals sector. Near-term strength is driven by a strong financial turnaround: management has successfully reduced large debts by over 60% and achieved consistent quarterly profits, stabilizing the business. This stability allows the company to focus on high-margin, scalable revenue streams, such as rapid growth in its private flight subscription service (Vaunt) and the commercialization of its proprietary aviation software (Mission Control). The long-term upside is the planned merger with M2i Global, which will fundamentally change the company's core business to focus on essential critical minerals. This move provides a new, high-growth narrative that separates Volato from the highly cyclical luxury travel industry, justifying a significant increase in valuation as it transitions into an industrial/technology hybrid.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the announced merger with M2i Global, Inc. successfully closes and the critical minerals business proves to be a viable, high-growth enterprise. We also assume that Volato's proprietary software platforms (Vaunt and Mission Control) continue to grow their subscription and licensing revenue at aggressive rates (35%+ sequential growth) and successfully transition the company to a scalable, tech-focused financial model. Finally, the company must maintain its new financial discipline, avoid adding new high liabilities, and sustain its streak of consistent quarterly profitability.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies holes and faults in the long thesis for Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) and forms a corresponding bear case.

### **Critique: Holes and Faults in the Long Thesis**

The bull case contains major flaws concerning the true value of the merger, the source of recent profitability, and the future ownership of its purported "technology platform" assets.

1.  **Massive Shareholder Dilution and Effective Reverse Takeover:** The "massive long-term pivot" via the merger with M2i Global is structured as an all-stock transaction where current Volato shareholders are expected to own only **10% to 15%** of the combined entity, while M2i Global shareholders will own approximately **85% to 90%**. This is an effective reverse merger, meaning the bull case for **Volato (SOAR)** as it currently exists is being exchanged for a small stake in a new, unproven critical minerals business.
2.  **Imminent Loss of Core Technology Platforms:** The assumption that Volato's proprietary software platforms (`Vaunt` and `Mission Control`) will "continue to grow their subscription and licensing revenue" under Volato is directly contradicted by a recent development. Volato has agreed to sell its aircraft sales division to flyExclusive and granted flyExclusive the **right to acquire** both `Vaunt` and `Mission Control` for a total stock consideration of approximately $4.1 million. This indicates the company is monetizing its "asset-light" growth engine, undermining the core narrative of transitioning into a *scalable, tech-focused financial model* under the current ticker.
3.  **Profitability Driven by Non-Recurring Events:** The claim of a successful "financial turnaround" and "consistent quarterly profits" is largely based on Q1 and Q2 2025 results that were primarily generated by **aircraft sales/trading program** revenue and **debt reduction** via settlements/asset sales. This profitability is reliant on *asset-heavy, non-recurring activities* (i.e., selling aircraft) rather than the high-margin, scalable subscription revenue (`Vaunt`'s Q1 subscription sales were a tiny fraction of the total revenue), contradicting the "asset-light" strategy.
4.  **Unproven Viability of Critical Minerals Business:** The long-term upside hinges on M2i Global's critical minerals business proving to be a "viable, high-growth enterprise." M2i is an early-stage company whose primary asset appears to be an $850 million copper offtake agreement, but there is a lack of proven, large-scale, current revenue or operational history to justify a $4.1M market cap company absorbing an entity valued at 85-90% of its future value. The successful execution of a new, complex industrial pivot carries high inherent risk.
5.  **Change in Management Focus and Expertise:** The transition from a private aviation/technology company to a critical minerals and industrial platform means the combined entity will be led by a new CEO from the M2i side, Maj. Gen. (Ret) Alberto Rosende. While the former Volato CEO will lead the small aviation unit, the new leadership team's primary expertise will be in a completely different, highly regulated, and capital-intensive sector (mining/minerals supply chain), creating significant integration and execution risk.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR)**

The bear case argues that SOAR shareholders are receiving a heavily diluted stake in a speculative, unproven critical minerals venture after monetizing its core technology and failing to achieve sustainable, scalable profitability from its supposed "asset-light" model.

1.  **Extreme Dilution and Value Transfer:** The stock is facing an immediate and severe re-rating due to a change of control transaction where current shareholders are left with only a small, minority stake (10-15%) in the post-merger company. This structure essentially transfers the market value and NYSE listing to the M2i Global team and its critical minerals pipeline.
2.  **Failure of the 'Asset-Light' Pivot:** Volato's recent profitability was non-recurring and driven by asset monetization (aircraft sales and debt settlements) rather than sustainable, high-margin, scalable software growth. The subsequent agreement to divest its high-growth technology platforms, `Vaunt` and `Mission Control`, for a minimal stock consideration demonstrates a lack of long-term confidence in its "technology-platform" vision and removes the primary justification for a technology-like valuation multiple.
3.  **High-Risk, Speculative New Business:** The combined company pivots into the critical minerals sector, which is capital-intensive, subject to commodity price volatility, and dependent on regulatory, governmental, and complex supply chain execution. The new core business is early-stage, lacks a multi-year track record of profitability and scale, and relies heavily on a single, major offtake agreement.
4.  **Capital Structure Uncertainty:** While debt has been reduced, the company previously disclosed an active plan to raise additional equity to extend its operating runway, and the merger itself is an all-stock transaction for the *buyer* (SOAR). This signals continued pressure on the capital structure, and the potential need for significant capital raises to fund the operations and infrastructure of the much larger, capital-intensive critical minerals business.

---

## Next Steps

The strategic pivot of Volato Group, Inc. (SOAR) has moved the investment thesis away from private aviation/tech to a critical minerals and industrial platform via an effective reverse merger. The long-term upside, customer stickiness, and proprietary technology themes of the initial analysis are now fundamentally undermined by the massive shareholder dilution and the sale of its core assets.

Based on the information, here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for investigation:

### **Focus Area 1: The Transformational M2i Global Merger and New Business (Critical Minerals)**

1.  **Analyze the M2i Global Core Business & Viability:** Investigate the operational status and true value of M2i Global’s assets beyond the $850 million copper offtake agreement. The agreement is for 88,000 tonnes of future copper production from NT Minerals in exchange for 12 million M2i shares, but it is not clear if this copper is currently in production or how M2i will fund its purchase rights or potential pre-funding opportunities.
2.  **Evaluate Combined Entity's Capital and Execution Risk:** Search for details on the new company's projected capital expenditure (CapEx) needs to execute the critical minerals strategy, especially since the new business will be in a highly capital-intensive sector. The original plan noted that Volato will not make any cash payments to M2i or its security holders, but the post-merger funding for the combined entity is a key unknown.
3.  **Confirm the Dilution and Shareholder Approval:** Confirm the definitive terms of the **90% M2i Global / 10% Volato shareholder split** and the status of the S-4 filing with the SEC to confirm the timeline of the shareholder vote. Understanding the full voting details for the merger is crucial before an investment decision.
4.  **Investigate New Management's Track Record:** Research the background and track record of the incoming CEO, Maj. Gen. (Ret) Alberto Rosende, and the rest of the M2i management team, specifically their experience in *commercializing* and *scaling* a critical minerals supply chain business, not just government or military service.

### **Focus Area 2: The Exit of the Aviation Technology Platforms**

5.  **Determine the True Value and Timeline of the Tech Sale:** Confirm the exact terms of the agreement with flyExclusive. The deal sells the aircraft sales division for $2.1 million in stock and grants flyExclusive the *right to acquire* Vaunt and Mission Control for an additional $2.0 million in stock. Determine when flyExclusive’s option to acquire Vaunt and Mission Control expires, as this small price for the "high-growth technology platforms" fundamentally contradicts the prior long thesis.
6.  **Quantify Recurring vs. Non-Recurring Profitability:** Obtain a detailed breakdown from the Q1 and Q2 2025 financial statements (10-Qs) to isolate how much net income came from **non-recurring events** (e.g., aircraft sales, debt settlements, the $6-8 million profit from the aircraft sales division sale mentioned in the flyExclusive announcement) versus **recurring revenue** (Vaunt subscriptions, leasing). This will validate the bear case that the "financial turnaround" is unsustainable.
7.  **Evaluate Future of the Residual Aviation Unit:** Investigate the scope and funding of the small, residual aviation technology unit that current CEO Matt Liotta is expected to lead post-merger, including the licensing of the **Parslee AI** platform. This will be the only remaining piece of the original business.
