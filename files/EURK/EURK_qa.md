## Business Summary

Eureka Acquisition Corp. is not an operating business; it is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). This means it was created solely to raise capital from investors, primarily within the US stock market, and put that money into a trust account. The company currently generates no revenue and has no customers or products. Its core business model is to use the pooled investor money to find and merge with a promising, established private company within a set timeframe, usually two years. This process allows the private target company to become a publicly traded company without going through the traditional, lengthy IPO process.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the deadline: if the company fails to find a suitable merger target within the allotted timeframe, it must dissolve (liquidate). Investors will get their initial cash back, but the investment opportunity is lost. A related near-term risk is that the SPAC team might rush a merger as the deadline approaches, potentially leading to a deal with a weaker company or one that is significantly overvalued. This historical tendency often results in steep stock declines after the merger is finalized. The main long-term risk relates to investor redemption; if public shareholders do not like the chosen merger partner, they can withdraw their capital, leaving the SPAC with far less money than planned to fund the acquired business. Furthermore, the market has recently shown skepticism toward SPAC mergers, meaning the stock of the acquired company often struggles post-merger, harming the company's ability to raise further funds and harming shareholder value.

## Company History

Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK) is not a traditional operating company that sells a product or service; it is a type of investment vehicle called a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or **SPAC**. This means its entire business is to raise money, find a promising private company, and merge with it to bring it public.

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history of Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK) from its founding to the present:

### **Part 1: Inception and Founding Goal (The "Blank Check")**

1.  **Inception:** Eureka Acquisition Corp was officially established in the Cayman Islands on June 13, 2023.
2.  **The Founding Goal (Why it was Founded):** The company was formed as a "blank check company," or a SPAC. Its sole purpose is to find an existing private business and complete a "Business Combination," such as a merger or acquisition, to take that private company public on a stock exchange.
3.  **Target Focus:** The company's initial strategy, or goal, was to specifically search for a target business in the fast-growing markets of **Asia**, including China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
4.  **The Sponsor:** The creation and management of EURK were backed by its sponsor, Hercules Capital Management Corp, which provided the initial capital and the team to search for the acquisition target.

### **Part 2: Going Public and Initial Momentum**

5.  **The Initial Public Offering (IPO):** The company successfully raised capital from public investors on July 3, 2024, when it completed its IPO.
6.  **Capital Raised:** The IPO sold 5,000,000 units at a price of \$10.00 each, raising an aggregate of \$50 million in gross proceeds. This money was placed into a protected trust account.
7.  **The IPO Tailwind:** The biggest tailwind (a factor helping the company) was the general market enthusiasm for SPACs, which provided a vehicle to raise capital quickly and gave the management team a pool of money to begin its search for a good Asian-based private company.

### **Part 3: Headwinds and Challenges in the Search**

8.  **The Ticking Clock (Major Headwind):** As a SPAC, EURK faced a strict deadline to complete an acquisition, which was initially set for July 3, 2025, about one year after its IPO.
9.  **The SPAC Market Slowdown (Industry Headwind):** The broader market sentiment toward SPACs cooled significantly after 2021, making it much harder to find a willing private company to merge with, especially in a geographically focused and complex region like Asia.
10. **The Deadline Dilemma:** As the July 2025 deadline approached without a deal, the company faced its biggest problem: a potential forced liquidation, which would mean giving the trust money back to shareholders and dissolving the company.

### **Part 4: Innovative Solutions and Present Status**

11. **The Extension Solution (The Lifeline):** To overcome the deadline problem, EURK held an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) for shareholders to vote on extending the period for finding a deal, which is a common but crucial strategy for SPACs.
12. **Management Challenges:** The company had to postpone the shareholder meeting multiple times in June 2025 to allow for more shareholder engagement, which indicated difficulty in securing the necessary votes to pass the extension proposal.
13. **Sponsor's Commitment:** The innovative solution to secure the extension involved the sponsor, Hercules Capital Management Corp, committing to deposit **\$150,000** into the trust account for each month of extension the company elected to use.
14. **The Extension Note:** This monthly fee is paid by the sponsor in the form of an unsecured promissory note (a promise to pay), which helps maintain the value of the trust account for remaining shareholders.
15. **Present Status:** The company is currently operating under these monthly extensions. The most recent news indicates that an extension was paid for in October 2025, setting the new deadline to complete the initial business combination for **November 3, 2025**.
16. **Current Goal:** Eureka Acquisition Corp remains a "Pre-Deal" SPAC, meaning its current and only business goal is to finalize a successful merger with a target company, primarily one operating in Asia, before its next extension runs out.

## Moat Analysis

The request asks for an analysis of the "moat" of Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK). However, based on the company's structure, the analysis must focus on its competitive advantage as a **Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)**, not as a traditional operating business.

A SPAC is a "blank check" company whose sole purpose is to raise money via an Initial Public Offering (IPO) to acquire a private operating company (the "business combination"). It has no products, services, customers, or revenue of its own.

Here is an analysis of Eureka Acquisition Corp's competitive position (its "moat") in the context of the SPAC market:

### The "Moat" of a SPAC: Deal-Sourcing and Execution

The competitive advantage, or "moat," for a SPAC like Eureka Acquisition Corp is not in its commercial operations but in the quality, reputation, and network of its management team, known as the "Sponsor." This is what allows it to successfully identify and close a high-quality acquisition target over other competitors.

#### 1. Differentiating Factor: Focused Geographic Expertise
*   **Specialized Focus:** Unlike generalist SPACs, Eureka Acquisition Corp explicitly focuses its search for a target business in **Asia**, with an emphasis on the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau). This regional focus can be a differentiator, as it suggests the management team possesses deep local knowledge, industry connections, and cultural fluency necessary to navigate complex Asian markets.
*   **Management Connections:** The company's CEO, Fen Zhang, is a Founding Partner of Hercules Capital Group, and the team highlights its decades of experience in investment banking, capital markets, and operating companies across multiple jurisdictions, which is their key selling point for deal sourcing in the region.

#### 2. Unique Market Position and Growth Reason
*   **The Growth Story:** The reason the company "grew into what it is today" is simply because it successfully completed a **$50 million Initial Public Offering (IPO)** in July 2024. This IPO provided the capital (the "blank check") that is its only asset and reason for existence.
*   **Not a Product-Based Moat:** The company does not have a "special position in the market" via products, pricing power, R&D, or network effects because it has no commercial operations. Its position is purely as a temporary, publicly-traded funding vehicle.

#### 3. Displacement Risk and Capital Advantage
*   **High Displacement Risk:** Eureka Acquisition Corp is highly susceptible to displacement. Any SPAC with a larger trust or a more successful, recognizable management team (a "celebrity-sponsor" SPAC) can compete for the same target company, often offering a more attractive deal.
*   **Competition from Capital:** Since a SPAC's primary asset is its cash in trust, a competitor with "more capital" and better terms can easily outbid or attract a target company. The **Sponsor's reputation for successful deal-making** is the main tool used to overcome capital size disadvantages.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** Furthermore, a SPAC is on a tight deadline (initially around 18-24 months) to complete a deal or liquidate. A competitor with more time remaining has an inherent advantage in negotiating.

#### 4. Customer Stickiness and Moat-Building Efforts
*   **No Commercial Stickiness:** The company has no *customers* in the traditional sense, and therefore no sticky or recurring contracts. Its "contracts" are with its public shareholders.
*   **Shareholder "Stickiness" is Weak:** Public shareholders (who are not yet "customers") can choose to **redeem** their shares for cash from the trust account if they dislike the proposed acquisition target or if the deadline for a merger is extended. This option makes the capital *un-sticky* and can reduce the amount of cash available to close the acquisition.
*   **Moat-Building Strategy:** The company's key strategy to create a "solid moat" is the stated commitment of its management team's **network and experience** to find a high-quality, high-growth private company in Asia. They are relying on their connections with private equity, investment banks, and founders to source exclusive deals.

#### 5. Innovation and R&D
*   **No R&D Investment:** Eureka Acquisition Corp is a non-operating company and therefore **does not invest in Research & Development (R&D)**.
*   **Innovation in Deal Structure:** The only form of "innovation" required is the ability of its sponsor to structure an acquisition deal (a De-SPAC transaction) that is attractive to both the private target company's owners and its own public shareholders, especially in a competitive SPAC market.

## Catalyst Analysis

The analysis of Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), indicates that its catalysts are primarily tied to the successful completion of a merger, as it does not have ongoing business operations.

### Catalysts for Stock Price Increase

#### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Announcement of a Definitive Business Combination Agreement (DA):**
    The single most significant near-term catalyst is the announcement of a merger agreement with a specific, high-quality private company, known as the "De-SPAC" transaction. This event transforms the company from a blank-check entity to a future operating business, typically leading to a sharp increase in the stock price.

2.  **Targeting and Negotiation Updates:**
    Any news suggesting the company is close to announcing a deal, such as filing a preliminary proxy statement or issuing a press release confirming advanced negotiations, could lead to short-term price appreciation. The search for a target is currently focused on businesses operating in **Asia, particularly in the People's Republic of China (PRC), Hong Kong, and Macau**.

3.  **Positive Trust Account Management and Extension Approvals:**
    The company recently announced a postponement of its extraordinary general meeting to June 30, 2025, and a revised contribution to the trust account. Successful approval of extensions and contributions that increase the per-share trust value can stabilize the stock and confirm the management's continued commitment to finding a target.

#### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Successful Completion of the Business Combination:**
    The ultimate long-term catalyst is the closing of the merger, which converts EURK into an operating company with a new ticker symbol and a real-world business model. The market's reception of the new company's business plan and financial projections will determine its long-term stock performance.

2.  **Performance of the Merged Entity:**
    Post-merger, the stock price will be driven by the financial results of the acquired company, including revenue growth, profitability, and successful execution of its expansion strategy, especially given the geographic focus on Asia.

3.  **Positive Reception of the Target's Sector and Management Team:**
    If the acquired company is in a high-growth sector (e.g., technology, services, as suggested by general SPAC interest) and has a strong, respected management team, it can attract significant long-term investor interest and valuation premiums.

### Management Strategy (Based on Filings)

As a pre-merger SPAC, the "management strategy" is focused entirely on the acquisition process. The public filings confirm the following strategic points:

*   **Primary Goal:** To effect a merger, asset acquisition, share purchase, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
*   **Geographic Focus:** The management intends to focus its search efforts on **target businesses operating in Asia, specifically in the People's Republic of China (PRC), Hong Kong, and Macau**.
*   **Time Horizon:** Management is working toward a deadline to complete the initial business combination, which was recently extended to **June 30, 2025**, through a postponement of the extraordinary general meeting.
*   **Experience Leverage:** Management indicates the team has **experience in finance, corporate strategy, and mergers and acquisitions**, which they will leverage to identify and execute a suitable transaction.

## Management Record

The management of Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK) must be analyzed in the context of its structure as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), which is currently in the search phase for a business combination.

### **Management Analysis for Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK)**

1.  **Key Executives and Corporate Affiliation:**
    *   The management team is led by **Dr. Fen Zhang (CEO & Chairman)**, a Canadian citizen residing in China for business purposes, and **Zhechen Wang (CFO)**.
    *   Dr. Zhang is a Founding Partner of **Hercules Capital Group**, which is also the company's sponsor, Hercules Capital Management Corp.

2.  **CEO and Management Background & History:**
    *   Dr. Fen Zhang has over a decade of experience in investment banking and fund management, specializing in initial public offerings (IPOs) and capital markets transactions in the U.S., Canada, and Asia.
    *   His professional history includes senior roles such as Managing Director/Executive Director at major financial institutions like **UBS Group AG** and **China International Capital Corp. Ltd.**
    *   CFO Zhechen Wang has a background in public company financial operations, previously serving as a Vice President of Finance at Hercules Capital Group and a senior associate at **PwC**, focusing on auditing for IPOs and public company reporting for various exchanges.

3.  **Track Record (Prior SPAC Experience):**
    *   Dr. Zhang's previous SPAC experience includes serving as the CEO of **Oak Woods Acquisition Corporation (OAKU)** from March 2022 to February 2023.
    *   While OAKU eventually identified a target company and entered into a merger agreement, it faced multiple extension deadlines, a delayed financial filing, and a compliance notice from Nasdaq after Dr. Zhang's tenure ended. This suggests his first SPAC sponsorship group has yet to complete a successful business combination.

4.  **Management Performance and Key Decisions (EURK):**
    *   As a new SPAC (IPO in July 2024), EURK has not yet delivered a completed business combination, which is the primary measure of a SPAC management team's performance for shareholders.
    *   A key decision has been the recent extension of the deadline to complete its initial business combination to November 2025, which required a $150,000 deposit from the sponsor.

5.  **Future Strategy and Vision:**
    *   The management's stated strategy is to initially focus its search on a target business operating in **Asia**, including China, leveraging their team's "accomplishments" and "current activities in the Asian market."
    *   They claim an overall vision of creating shareholder value by acquiring strong businesses at disciplined valuations and fostering financial discipline.

6.  **Potential Investor Considerations:**
    *   The management team possesses broad experience in high-level investment banking and capital markets, suggesting strong deal-sourcing capabilities.
    *   A potential risk for investors is that EURK is Dr. Zhang's second pre-deal SPAC (he is also involved with Columbus Acquisition Corp), and his first SPAC has not yet reached a successful closing.
    *   The board of directors is noted for having a relatively low average tenure of 1.2 years, which may be a point of concern regarding board experience, though it includes a director with a distinguished MIT background.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings for Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), the management's incentives are structured to strongly align with the successful completion of a business combination, which is generally in the shareholders' interest.

### **Incentives and Compensation Structure (The "Sponsor" Model)**

1.  **Founders' Stock ("Promote"):** The primary incentive and compensation for the management team and sponsor (Hercules Capital Management Corp) is the **Class B ordinary shares** (known as "founder shares" or "promote"). The initial shareholders, including the sponsor, officers, and directors, owned **20%** of the issued and outstanding shares following the IPO, prior to any public share redemptions.
2.  **Zero-Cost Basis:** These founder shares are acquired at a nominal cost (often pennies per share) and have virtually zero value if the SPAC fails to complete a merger. This structure means the management's potential return is entirely dependent on the successful completion of a business combination and the subsequent performance of the merged public company.
3.  **Warrants/Private Placement:** The sponsor also purchased **Private Units** concurrently with the IPO, providing additional capital and creating another incentive that pays off only upon a successful business combination.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

4.  **High Insider Ownership (Alignment with Shareholders):** The initial search indicated a very high insider ownership percentage, with one source reporting **75.19%**. While initial SPAC ownership is typically 20% of the total outstanding shares post-IPO for the sponsor and directors, the exceptionally high current percentage suggests that a substantial number of public shares have been redeemed, dramatically increasing the managers' proportionate stake.
    *   *Conclusion on Ownership:* Higher insider ownership is generally considered better, as the managers are, in effect, the majority shareholders, and their wealth is inextricably tied to the company's stock value post-merger.

### **Incentive for Action (Avoiding Liquidation)**

5.  **Monthly Extension Fees:** The management and sponsor face a direct financial cost to extend the deadline for completing a business combination. To extend the period, the company must deposit a **Revised Monthly Extension Fee of $150,000** into the trust account for each month of extension.
    *   *Conclusion on Cost:* These fees, typically paid by the sponsor/manager, represent a continued out-of-pocket cash commitment, which increases the pressure to find and complete a deal rather than simply delaying or liquidating.
6.  **Liquidation Risk (Loss of Investment):** If the company fails to complete a business combination within the extended timeframe, the Class B ordinary shares (the sponsor's main compensation) will become worthless, and the company will liquidate, returning the trust money to public shareholders.

### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

*   The management's incentive structure is highly aligned with the interests of the shareholders in the context of a SPAC. Their primary compensation (founder shares) has minimal value unless they successfully complete a business combination that drives the stock price above the $10 IPO price.
*   The continued requirement to pay a substantial **$150,000 monthly extension fee** further incentivizes them to find a suitable, value-generating merger target quickly, rather than merely lining their pockets through salary or fees.
*   The dramatic increase in *proportionate* insider ownership due to redemptions (implied by the 75.19% figure) suggests the management team has a vested interest in the long-term success of the post-merger company, as they now own a super-majority of the equity.

## Price History

Based on the price history and technical analysis for Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK), here is an analysis:

1.  **Stock Status and Nature:** Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK) is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) with no significant operations, whose purpose is to merge with or acquire another business. The stock's current price is very close to its initial public offering (IPO) trust value (typically around \$10.00), which is normal for a pre-merger SPAC.

2.  **Price Relative to 52-Week Low:** The stock's most recent closing price was \$10.80. With a 52-week low of \$10.06, the current price is approximately **7.36%** above its 52-week low.

3.  **Price Relative to 52-Week High:** The stock is trading very close to its 52-week high of \$10.83, indicating it is on the higher end of its one-year trading range.

4.  **Technical Analysis and Trading Trend:** Technical analysis suggests the stock is moving within a narrow and "horizontal trend," which is a common characteristic of SPAC shares. The stock holds "buy signals from both short and long-term Moving Averages," suggesting a positive short-term outlook, but also shows a "sell signal from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)," indicating mixed signals.

5.  **Lack of Big Drops or Gains:** There have been no "bigly" drops or increases in the last few months; the stock has shown "very controlled movements" and low volatility. The price stability is typical because the company holds most of its capital in a trust account, providing a theoretical floor near the trust value for investors who choose to redeem their shares.

6.  **Explanation for Recent Minor Movements:** Recent minor price fluctuations are likely related to news of the company **extending its business combination deadline** and announcing revisions or contributions to the trust account, which are common events as a SPAC nears its deadline to complete an acquisition.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Eureka Acquisition Corp is entirely dependent on its management team successfully using their network to find and acquire a high-growth, high-quality private company in Asia before their November 2025 deadline. In the near term, the stock will likely jump significantly the moment they announce a merger with an exciting target company (e.g., a fast-growing tech or services company in China or Hong Kong). This announcement proves the management’s value and removes the risk of the company being forced to shut down. The management team is highly incentivized to find a great deal because their primary compensation (their 'free' ownership shares) becomes worthless if they liquidate. The long-term bull case relies on the acquired Asian company executing its business plan perfectly after the merger closes. If the new public company achieves rapid revenue growth and profitability, the stock will climb far above the current $10 price, realizing substantial returns for shareholders who backed the management team's ability to source a superior international deal.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. **Successful Deal Closure:** The management team secures and announces a merger deal before the November 2025 deadline, and shareholders approve it with minimal cash redemptions. 2. **Quality of Target:** The acquired private company is fundamentally strong, high-growth, and valued fairly, meaning the merger is not rushed or overvalued. 3. **Market Reception:** The public market and investors react favorably to the announced merger, confirming the target company's business model and growth potential. 4. **Geographic Expertise Pays Off:** The management's specific focus on complex Asian markets (China/Hong Kong) actually leads to a unique, highly attractive deal that generalist companies could not access.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Eureka Acquisition Corp (EURK) relies on a number of high-risk assumptions, many of which are directly contradicted by current market realities for SPACs, especially those targeting Greater China.

## Bear Case Thesis and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Extreme Deadline Pressure Increases Risk of an Inferior Deal:** The core assumption of a "high-quality" and "fairly valued" target is at risk because the business combination deadline is extremely tight (November 3, 2025). This intense time pressure increases the likelihood that the management team will pursue a less-than-optimal target company at an inflated valuation just to avoid liquidation and save their sponsor shares.

2.  **Lack of Proven SPAC Expertise in Management:** The bull case's entire foundation—that the stock will jump due to the *management's value* in sourcing a superior deal—is unproven. There is no publicly available, verifiable track record of the CEO, Dr. Fen Zhang, or the sponsor, Hercules Capital Management Corp, successfully completing a high-performing SPAC merger in the past.

3.  **Cross-Border SPACs, Especially China-Focused, Have a Poor Track Record:** Historical data shows that SPACs that merge with **Chinese target firms** have suffered the **worst post-merger stock performance** over a one-year period, significantly underperforming those with U.S. and other non-China emerging market targets. This directly refutes the long-term bull case's reliance on the acquired Asian company "executing its business plan perfectly."

4.  **Negative Market Reception is Likely, Countering the "Stock Will Jump" Assumption:** Investor sentiment for cross-border SPAC deals, particularly those involving China, is significantly less positive due to high information asymmetry, greater regulatory risk, and lower accounting standards. This suggests the announced merger is unlikely to trigger the substantial stock price jump the thesis predicts.

5.  **Misalignment of Sponsor/Shareholder Interests:** The thesis correctly notes that management is "highly incentivized to find a great deal" to keep their shares from becoming worthless. However, their incentive is to complete **any deal** (a closure incentive), not necessarily the **best deal** (a quality incentive), which creates an inherent conflict of interest with public shareholders.

6.  **The SPAC Structure is Not Benefiting from the IPO Revival:** While recent reports show a revival in the Hong Kong IPO market in 2025, positive metrics on fundraising and applications are explicitly calculated **excluding SPAC listings and de-SPAC projects**, suggesting this particular vehicle may not be capitalizing on the general market optimism as the long thesis assumes.

7.  **High Potential for Cash Redemptions:** Given the general poor post-merger performance of China-focused SPACs and the tight deadline, shareholders may rationally choose to redeem their shares for their liquidation value (currently ~$10.71) rather than approve a rushed deal, leading to minimal cash in the trust for the acquired company and a poorly capitalized new public entity.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the core of the investigation has shifted from "what is the company?" to "can this management team execute a good deal under pressure?" The next steps should focus on quantifying the remaining risk/reward and seeking final confirmation on the management's track record.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for further investigation:

### **I. Quantify the Final Capital Risk for EURK**

1.  **Determine the True Post-Redemption Cash in Trust (Critical):** The latest *implied* share count of 4.83 million public shares (out of an initial 5.75 million) suggests a significant redemption event took place between the early 2024 filing and the recent October 2025 data.
    *   **Action:** Search for the SEC filing (likely a DEF 14A or 8-K) announcing the *results* of the June 2025 extension vote to find the final number of shares redeemed and the post-redemption shares outstanding. This number directly determines the total cash available for the acquisition.

2.  **Calculate the Exact Redemption Floor Price (NAV per Share):** Although the stock is trading near $10.71, the precise current Net Asset Value (NAV) per public share (including accrued interest and the sponsor's **$150,000 monthly contribution**) needs to be confirmed.
    *   **Action:** Find the latest "Trust Account" balance figure and the most recent public share count (from step 1) to calculate the exact liquidation value per share, defining the downside risk.

### **II. Vetting Management's Track Record (OAKU Final Status)**

3.  **Find the Definitive Conclusion of the Management's Former SPAC (OAKU):** The analysis shows the OAKU/Huajin merger has been continually delayed, in violation of Nasdaq filing rules, and subject to multiple extensions into 2025, but no final closing/liquidation was announced.
    *   **Action:** Search for news or SEC filings mentioning the *termination* of the OAKU/Huajin agreement or any stock quotes for "Huajin Health Group Company Limited" (the proposed new name). The inability to find a final ticker suggests a high probability of deal failure or liquidation, which is a major red flag for EURK's management credibility.

4.  **Assess the Other Current SPAC's Progress (Columbus Acquisition Corp - COLA):** The CEO is simultaneously sponsoring another pre-deal SPAC focused on Asia. This implies a significant dilution of management focus.
    *   **Action:** Briefly check for recent announcements or rumors for COLA. If COLA announces a deal before EURK's November deadline, it suggests the best targets are being allocated elsewhere, or management has severely split its attention.

### **III. Scenario Planning for a Near-Deadline Deal**

5.  **Evaluate the Minimum Deal Size vs. Maximum Target Size:** Based on the confirmed remaining cash (from step 1), analyze what size of target company EURK can realistically acquire and what level of **Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE)** financing would be necessary.
    *   **Question:** If the current cash in trust is low (e.g., <$20 million post-redemption), what kind of "high-growth, high-quality" Asian business can a \$250 million valuation SPAC with little cash realistically acquire without a massive, dilutive PIPE deal?

6.  **Investigate the Chinese Regulatory / VIE Risk for the Target:** The target is focused on the complex China/Asia region, which introduces political and Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure risk.
    *   **Question:** What regulatory environment (e.g., changes to US PCAOB oversight, China's outbound IPO restrictions) does the specific "Asia-focused" target industry face? A generic, rushed deal in this environment carries extreme post-merger risk.
