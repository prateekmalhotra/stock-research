This valuation is performed under a significant market-specific condition: **Denny's Corporation (DENN) has entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired for \$6.25 per share in cash.** [cite: 11 in step 1] The current market price has converged to this acquisition price, indicating the transaction is highly likely to close.

Therefore, the calculated Fair Value from the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model represents the company's *standalone intrinsic value* over a long-term horizon (to 2030), which is a purely academic exercise given the short-term certainty of the buyout price.

### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

Denny's Corporation's business engine is driven by its franchising model (generating franchise and license revenue) and its small base of Company Restaurant Sales, split between the mature **Denny's** brand and the growth brand **Keke's Breakfast Cafe**. The strategy involves optimizing the Denny's franchise system, pushing value, and growing Keke's.

| Metric | Business Driver / Constraint | Source/Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Revenue (FY 2024)** | \$452.3 million | Fiscal Year 2024 Revenue [cite: 13 in step 1] |
| **Denny's SRS** | Soft/Negative (-1.3% in Q2 2025). | Conservative: Assume Denny's System-wide Sales (majority of revenue base) remains flat (0% growth) as franchise closures offset modest check increases. |
| **Keke's Growth** | Positive (4.0% SRS in Q2 2025). | Conservative: Assume Keke's unit expansion (new cafes) and SRS growth drives a modest overall revenue uplift. |
| **Management Commentary** | The pending acquisition means no new financial guidance for FY 2025. [cite: 17 in step 1] | **Conservative Assumption:** Given the company's mature structure and focus on optimization/refranchising rather than aggressive organic growth (prior guidance included closures), and the lack of updated long-term guidance, a conservative low-single-digit growth rate is appropriate. |

#### Revenue Projections (in millions)

| Year | Growth Rate | Projected Revenue | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base (FY 2024)** | N/A | \$452.3 | Actual FY 2024 Revenue. [cite: 13 in step 1] |
| **2025** | 1.0% | \$456.8 | Conservative estimate reflecting minimal net system growth and a slight check increase. |
| **2026** | 1.5% | \$463.6 | Slight acceleration as Keke's growth slightly outweighs Denny's optimization. |
| **2027** | 1.5% | \$470.5 | Consistent low-single-digit growth. |
| **2028** | 2.0% | \$479.9 | Slight increase on belief in Keke's compounding growth. |
| **2029** | 2.0% | \$489.5 | Consistent growth. |
| **2030** | 2.0% | \$499.3 | Consistent growth. |

### 3. Net Income Projection and DCF Inputs

#### A. Margin & ROIC Assumptions

*   **Net Income Margin:** FY 2024 Net Income Margin was 4.8%. [cite: 13 in step 1] Given the relatively high stability of the franchising model (Franchise Operating Margin of ~51-52%) [cite: 17 in step 1], I will assume a stable Net Income Margin of **4.8%** for all projected years.
*   **Base Net Income (FY 2024):** \$21.6 million. [cite: 13 in step 1]
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Past ROIC was cited at 7.70% (non-SEC proxy). [cite: 1 in step 1] To be conservative, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC of **5.0%**.
    *   *Net Income for Year N = (Projected Revenue for Year N \* Net Income Margin) + (Net Income for Year N-1 \* ROIC).*

#### B. Discounted Cash Flow Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is a conservative estimate for the cost of equity/capital for a relatively mature, publicly traded restaurant company that is heavily franchised and carries significant debt, and is higher than the WACC estimate of 6.77% found in the search results. [cite: 1 in step 1]
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **3.0%**. This is the perpetual growth rate for the terminal value, which is very conservative for a mature business model, aligning with or below long-term GDP and inflation forecasts.

#### C. Projected Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (in millions)

| Year | Projected Revenue | Base Net Income (Rev \* 4.8%) | Net Income from ROIC (Prev Year NI \* 5.0%) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | \$452.3 | N/A | N/A | \$21.60 | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | \$456.8 | \$21.93 | \$1.08 | **\$23.01** | 0.917 | \$21.09 |
| **2026** | \$463.6 | \$22.25 | \$1.15 | **\$23.40** | 0.842 | \$19.70 |
| **2027** | \$470.5 | \$22.58 | \$1.17 | **\$23.75** | 0.772 | \$18.33 |
| **2028** | \$479.9 | \$23.04 | \$1.19 | **\$24.23** | 0.708 | \$17.19 |
| **2029** | \$489.5 | \$23.50 | \$1.21 | **\$24.71** | 0.650 | \$16.06 |
| **2030** | \$499.3 | \$23.97 | \$1.24 | **\$25.21** | 0.596 | \$15.02 |
| **Sub-Total NPV** | | | | | | **\$107.39** |

#### D. Terminal Value and Final NPV

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (at end of 2030):**
*   TV = [Cash Flow 2030 \* (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = [\$25.21 million \* (1 + 0.03)] / (0.09 - 0.03)
*   TV = \$25.97 million / 0.06 = **\$432.83 million**

**Terminal Value Present Value (PV) Calculation:**
*   TV PV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Terminal Year)
*   TV PV = \$432.83 million / (1 + 0.09)^6
*   TV PV = \$432.83 million \* 0.596 (same as 2030 DF) = **\$257.87 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
*   Total NPV = Sub-Total NPV (2025-2030) + Terminal Value PV
*   Total NPV = \$107.39 million + \$257.87 million = **\$365.26 million**

***

### 4. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value of Equity = Total NPV + Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt**

*   Total NPV: \$365.26 million
*   Cash & Cash Equivalents: \$1.166 million [cite: 7 in step 1]
*   Total Debt: \$269.2 million [cite: 17 in step 1]

*   Fair Value of Equity = \$365.26 million + \$1.166 million - \$269.2 million = **\$97.23 million**

**Fair Value Per Share = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding**

*   Shares Outstanding: 51.5 million [cite: 15 in step 1]
*   Fair Value Per Share = \$97.23 million / 51.5 million shares = **\$1.89 per share**

## Final Valuation and Justification

### Fair Value of Denny's Corporation (DENN) Stock

Based on the conservative long-term Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model:

**Fair Value Per Share: \$1.89**

### Market Comparison and Justification

| Metric | DCF Fair Value (Standalone) | Market Price / Buyout Value | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Value Per Share** | \$1.89 | \$6.25 | Market is **230% higher** |

**Justification for the Difference:**

The calculated standalone intrinsic value of **\$1.89 per share** is significantly lower than the market's current price of **\$6.25 per share**. The difference is not due to a flaw in the DCF assumptions but is entirely due to the market pricing the stock based on the definitive, all-cash acquisition offer.

*   **Market Reality (The Deal):** Denny's Corporation has a definitive agreement to be acquired by Sparkle Topco Corp. (an affiliate of TriArtisan Capital Advisors) for **\$6.25 in cash per share**. [cite: 11 in step 1] The market price has converged to this offer price, which is the ceiling for the stock's value (minus arbitrage opportunity), making the DCF irrelevant for investment decision-making.

*   **The Market's Implicit Assumptions (The Buyer's View):** The acquirer, TriArtisan Capital, is essentially making a much more optimistic assumption about the company's future free cash flow, or has a lower cost of capital, and/or plans to implement aggressive operational changes (e.g., deeper cost cuts, significant refranchising, or more aggressive unit growth/synergies) that generate a standalone value of at least \$6.25 per share.
    *   To get to a DCF Fair Value of \$6.25, the Total NPV would need to be approximately \$590 million (\[\$6.25 \* 51.5M shares\] + \$269.2M Debt - \$1.166M Cash). This would require a much more aggressive Perpetual Growth Rate (Maturity Rate) in the Terminal Value calculation, likely in the range of **5.5% to 6.0%**, or a significantly lower Discount Rate (WACC). The difference of $590M - $365.26M $\approx$ $225M$ is the premium the buyer is willing to pay over the conservative standalone intrinsic value.

*   **Conclusion:** The DCF valuation of \$1.89 reflects a very conservative standalone intrinsic value for a mature, heavily franchised, and debt-laden company based on historical metrics and low growth. The market, however, is not valuing the company's future cash flows; it is valuing the certainty of the **\$6.25 per share cash payout** from the pending acquisition.
