### II. Business Engine Analysis & Future Assumptions

Denny's operates a highly franchised model, where **Franchise & License Revenue** (Royalties, Advertising fees, etc.) is the primary contributor to profit due to its high margin ($\sim$51\%). **Company Restaurant Sales** are a smaller, lower-margin (11\%-12\%) revenue stream.

The business engine's key drivers, based on management commentary, are:

1.  **Strategic Culling and Stabilization of Denny's:** Management is intentionally closing 70 to 90 lower-volume Denny's franchise restaurants in 2025 to improve the health of the brand. This will cause a near-term decline in total unit count and franchise revenue. Same-restaurant sales (SSS) are weak, with 2025 guidance between (2.0)\% and 1.0\%, reflecting a focus on value offers (\$2, \$4, \$6, \$8) to attract value-conscious consumers in a challenging macro-environment.
2.  **Keke's Breakfast Cafe Expansion:** The Keke's brand is a growth engine, with positive SSS (4.0\% in Q2 2025) and continued expansion (25-40 consolidated openings in 2025). Keke's has higher household income customers than Denny's.
3.  **Off-Premise/Digital:** Off-premise sales remain a key component (21\% of sales [cite: 10 in previous search]), providing an avenue for sales growth outside of traditional dine-in.
4.  **Margin Management:** Management is focused on cost-saving initiatives, targeting up to 200 basis points in margin savings [cite: 7 in previous search].

#### A. Revenue Projection Model

| Year | Total Revenue (in thousands) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TTM** | \$454,000 [cite: 13 in previous search] | Trailing Twelve Months Revenue (Q3 2024 - Q2 2025). |
| **2025** | \$450,000 | **Conservative Assumption:** A slight **(0.9)\% decline** from TTM. This is driven by the strategic closure of 70-90 low-volume Denny's units, which is expected to offset the modest SSS and Keke's growth. |
| **2026** | \$454,500 | **Conservative Assumption:** A minimal **1.0\% growth**. This accounts for the closure program winding down and the full-year impact of Keke's expansion and Denny's newly stabilized, higher-quality unit base starting to generate a minor net positive effect. |
| **2027** | \$463,590 | **Conservative Assumption:** **2.0\% growth**. The "culling" strategy has completed, and the stabilized brand is now achieving moderate SSS growth and net unit growth from Keke's and remodeled Denny's. This is in-line with conservative long-term restaurant industry growth. |
| **2028** | \$472,862 | **Conservative Assumption:** **2.0\% growth**. Sustained moderate growth. |
| **2029** | \$482,319 | **Conservative Assumption:** **2.0\% growth**. Sustained moderate growth. |
| **2030** | \$491,965 | **Conservative Assumption:** **2.0\% growth**. Sustained moderate growth. |

#### B. Margin and Net Income Projection

*   **Gross Margin / Operating Margin:** The TTM Net Income Margin is low (Net Income is $\sim$ \$10M for TTM; \$10M / \$454M $\approx$ 2.2\%). Due to the high-margin franchise model, a higher blended margin is expected as Company-Owned units are refranchised.
*   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** I will conservatively project an average long-term Net Income Margin of **2.5\%** of total revenue. This is a slight improvement from the TTM result, factoring in the promised margin savings and the shift to a higher-margin, asset-light franchise model.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income Before ROIC (B = A * Margin) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$450,000 | 2.5\% | \$11,250 |
| **2026** | \$454,500 | 2.5\% | \$11,363 |
| **2027** | \$463,590 | 2.5\% | \$11,590 |
| **2028** | \$472,862 | 2.5\% | \$11,822 |
| **2029** | \$482,319 | 2.5\% | \$12,058 |
| **2030** | \$491,965 | 2.5\% | \$12,299 |

#### C. ROIC Assumption and Final Cash Flow (Net Income)

The Company has negative shareholder equity [cite: 10 in previous search], which leads to a meaningless or negative traditional ROIC calculation. Following the rule, I will assume a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC on the reinvested cash (Net Income from the previous year).

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **3.0\%**. This assumes management can generate a low, steady return on the portion of net income that is reinvested into the business (e.g., Keke's expansion, Denny's remodels).
*   **Cash Flow to Equity (CF):** The Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).
    $$CF_t = \text{Net Income}_t + (\text{Net Income}_{t-1} \times \text{ROIC})$$

| Year | NI Before ROIC (B) | ROIC on Prior NI (C = $\text{NI}_{t-1} \times 3.0\%$) | Total FCFE (D = B + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$11,250 | \$0 (Base Year) | **\$11,250** |
| **2026** | \$11,363 | \$338 | **\$11,701** |
| **2027** | \$11,590 | \$351 | **\$11,941** |
| **2028** | \$11,822 | \$358 | **\$12,180** |
| **2029** | \$12,058 | \$365 | **\$12,423** |
| **2030** | \$12,299 | \$373 | **\$12,672** |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### A. Rate Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0\%** | A reasonable WACC for a franchised restaurant company. It balances the stability of the franchise model with the inherent operational risk and negative equity position. |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | **1.0\%** | A conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting the expectation that the business will mature and grow in-line with or slightly below long-term U.S. GDP/inflation. |

#### B. NPV Calculation

| Year | FCFE (in thousands) (D) | Discount Factor $\left(1 / (1 + 9.0\%)^t\right)$ | Net Present Value (NPV) (in thousands) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=1) | \$11,250 | 0.9174 | \$10,321 |
| **2026** (t=2) | \$11,701 | 0.8417 | \$9,848 |
| **2027** (t=3) | \$11,941 | 0.7722 | \$9,221 |
| **2028** (t=4) | \$12,180 | 0.7084 | \$8,629 |
| **2029** (t=5) | \$12,423 | 0.6499 | \$8,074 |
| **2030** (t=6) | \$12,672 | 0.5963 | \$7,560 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **\$53,653** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

1.  **Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
    $$\text{TV}_{2030} = \left(\text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})\right) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$$
    $$\text{TV}_{2030} = \left(\$12,672 \times (1 + 0.01)\right) / (0.09 - 0.01)$$
    $$\text{TV}_{2030} = \$12,799 / 0.08 = \$159,988 \text{ thousand}$$

2.  **Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV):**
    $$\text{NPV TV} = \text{TV}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{t=6}$$
    $$\text{NPV TV} = \$159,988 \times 0.5963 = \$95,438 \text{ thousand}$$

3.  **Total Enterprise Value (Equity Value):**
    $$\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{NPV TV}$$
    $$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$53,653 + \$95,438 = \mathbf{\$149,091} \text{ thousand}$$

---

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Stock} = (\text{Total Equity Value} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}) / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$

| Metric | Value (in thousands) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Equity Value | \$149,091 |
| PLUS: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$1,166 |
| LESS: Total Debt | (\$279,000) |
| **Total Fair Market Value of Equity** | **(\$128,743)** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \text{Total Fair Market Value of Equity} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = (-\$128,743 \text{ thousand}) / 51,500 \text{ thousand shares} = \mathbf{(\$2.50) \text{ per share}}$$

---

### V. Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is (\$2.50)**.

If we assume a hypothetical current market price of **\$4.13** per share (based on common rounding of market data), the market is implying a significant positive value where this conservative DCF model indicates a negative one.

**Reasoning for the Discrepancy (Model vs. Market):**

The core issue driving the negative valuation is the **Company's high level of Total Debt (\$279 million)** relative to its cash-generating ability (Net Income/FCFE $\sim$ \$11-\$12 million per year) and negligible cash balance.

1.  **Negative Shareholder Equity:** The company operates with a high debt-to-equity ratio and negative shareholder equity [cite: 10 in previous search]. This structure makes the debt a significant burden on the equity value, especially for a mature, slow-growth business.
2.  **Conservative FCFE (Net Income) Assumption:** The model uses a highly conservative Net Income (FCFE) projection, assuming a slow, stable $2.0\%$ long-term revenue growth and a conservative $2.5\%$ Net Income Margin.
    *   **The Market's Assumption:** The market is likely pricing in an expectation of significantly higher future profitability or Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) that will be used to aggressively pay down the debt. For the stock price to be \$4.13, the market is assuming an Equity Value of approximately \$212.6 million ($\$4.13 \times 51.5$ million shares). To achieve this, the market is assuming a discounted future cash flow (NPV of FCFE) of approximately **\$390 million** ($\$212.6M + \$279M \text{ Debt } - \$1.16M \text{ Cash}$). This would require a terminal growth rate or future FCFE significantly higher than the conservative assumptions used here.
    *   *Example of a Market Assumption:* If the market assumes a terminal growth rate of **2.5\%** (instead of $1.0\%$) and a higher sustainable Net Income Margin of **3.5\%** (instead of $2.5\%$), the resulting Fair Value Per Share would likely be positive and closer to the current price.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:** The conservative nature of this DCF model, particularly the modest revenue growth (2.0\% terminal) and low Net Income Margin (2.5\%) assumptions for a company with a heavy debt load, results in a negative Fair Value. The market is giving management the benefit of the doubt, believing the **"culling the herd"** strategy and **Keke's expansion** will lead to a much stronger and faster increase in Net Income/FCFE than is conservatively projected here, enabling a much quicker deleveraging or a higher valuation of the future stable cash flow stream.
