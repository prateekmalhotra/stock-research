## Business Summary

Valaris Limited operates globally as a major offshore drilling contractor. The company’s core business model is centered on owning, leasing, and operating a large fleet of highly specialized mobile drilling rigs—such as jackups, drillships, and semi-submersibles—which are massive structures used to drill for oil and natural gas deep beneath the ocean floor. Their customers are strictly B2B (business-to-business), consisting primarily of major international oil companies (IOCs) and national oil companies (NOCs) that require these expensive, specialized assets to develop energy reserves. Valaris earns revenue through ‘dayrates,’ which are daily rental fees charged to the customer for the use of the rig and the provision of skilled crews. This service-based revenue is distributed across key global drilling regions, including the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and various offshore areas near Africa, Asia, and South America.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk to Valaris’s business is the extreme cyclical nature of the energy industry, which is directly tied to the volatile global price of oil and gas. Since offshore drilling is among the most expensive types of energy production, if oil prices drop sharply, customers immediately slash their capital expenditure budgets, leading to rig cancellations, contract renegotiations, or drastically reduced dayrates. This commodity price sensitivity has historically caused severe financial distress for drilling contractors, notably during the 2014–2016 downturn. A second near-term risk is high fixed costs; even when rigs are idle (stacked), they require significant maintenance and personnel expenditures, squeezing profitability when utilization is low. The primary long-term threat is the global energy transition. As governments and companies pursue decarbonization and shift toward renewable energy sources, the long-term demand outlook for fossil fuels—especially those requiring deep, expensive offshore development—may permanently decline, risking the obsolescence of Valaris's multi-billion dollar rig fleet and restricting future growth opportunities.

## Company History

This history of Valaris Limited is a story of mergers, major market challenges, and financial transformation, all centered on the business of drilling for oil and natural gas beneath the ocean.

### 1. The Roots: From Texas Oil Crisis to Offshore Pioneer (1975 - 1987)

1.  **Inception after a Crisis:** The company’s original foundation dates back to 1975, when John R. Blocker bought a small drilling company and renamed it **Blocker Energy Corporation**. This founding occurred shortly after the 1973 oil crisis, establishing its initial purpose as a contract drilling company to help energy firms find and produce oil.
2.  **First Major Headwind (The 1980s Oil Glut):** In the early 1980s, the company borrowed heavily to grow its fleet, but the price of oil suddenly dropped in 1982. This steep decline was a massive headwind that forced the company into an early financial restructuring to avoid bankruptcy, resulting in its banks taking majority ownership.
3.  **A Fresh Start:** Following a new investment and leadership, the company was renamed **Energy Service Company (Ensco)** in 1987, establishing the core brand identity that would drive decades of growth and expansion.

### 2. Growth Through Acquisitions and Technology (1990s - 2018)

4.  **Early Consolidation:** Ensco expanded its fleet and geographic reach through strategic acquisitions, such as acquiring Penrod in 1990. This move was the first sign of a long-term strategy to gain strength and scale in the competitive drilling market.
5.  **Focus on Deepwater:** By the early 2000s, the company recognized the growing need for deeper drilling and began expanding its fleet to include sophisticated deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling rigs and vessels. This focus on high-technology, high-value rigs was a crucial innovative solution to maintain relevance as easily accessible oil reserves became scarcer.
6.  **Becoming a Giant:** In the 2010s, Ensco made two massive acquisitions: Pride International in 2011 and Atwood Oceanics in 2017. These moves significantly increased the company’s size and diversified its fleet to include one of the world's largest collections of high-quality drilling rigs.
7.  **Founding a Joint Venture:** A key strategic move was the formation of **ARO Drilling**, a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, which secured a massive presence in the Middle East jackup rig market. This provided a stable, long-term revenue stream—a strong tailwind—in a reliable oil-producing region.

### 3. The Modern Company: Valaris is Born (2019 - Present)

8.  **The Final Merger:** In 2019, Ensco merged with **Rowan Companies plc** to create an even larger company called **EnscoRowan plc**. The purpose of this merger was to combine two complementary fleets, gain unmatched scale and diversification, and create a stronger financial position that could better withstand the industry's inevitable ups and downs.
9.  **The Valaris Name:** Shortly after the merger, the combined company was rebranded to **Valaris Limited** in July 2019, a name inspired by the Latin root words for strength, courage, and value. This name change aimed to create a new identity and accelerate the cultural alignment of the two merged organizations.
10. **The Second Major Headwind (The 2020 Downturn):** A severe, prolonged industry slump, driven by low oil prices and the global COVID-19 pandemic, created immense pressure on the newly merged company, which was burdened with significant legacy debt. The company faced drastically reduced demand and lower daily operating rates for its rigs.
11. **Innovative Financial Solution:** In 2020, Valaris was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure its finances. This financial reset was a painful but effective solution that eliminated over $7 billion of debt, allowing the company to emerge in 2021 with a much stronger and healthier balance sheet.
12. **The Goal and Current Status:** Today, Valaris Limited is one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors, operating a diverse fleet of high-tech drillships and jack-up rigs. Its ultimate goal is to provide responsible, safe, and highly efficient drilling services to global energy companies, backed by a significant contract backlog, capitalizing on the current robust offshore drilling market as a major tailwind.

## Moat Analysis

Valaris Limited (VAL) operates in the highly cyclical and capital-intensive offshore contract drilling industry. Its competitive advantage, or moat, is not based on traditional intellectual property or a network effect like a technology company, but rather on its **scale, fleet quality, operational track record, and superior financial position** relative to its peers.

Here is an analysis of Valaris's moat and competitive differentiation:

### **Moat and Competitive Differentiation**

1.  **Largest and Most Balanced Fleet by Vessel Count:** Valaris owns the world's largest offshore drilling rig fleet, offering a unique combination of ultra-deepwater drillships and a leading premium jackup fleet. This scale allows it to service a wider range of customers and projects globally, providing geographic and operational flexibility that few competitors can match.

2.  **Focus on Premium, High-Specification Assets:** Valaris maintains a modern, high-quality fleet, with 12 out of 13 of its drillships being state-of-the-art 7th Generation assets. These premium rigs are the only ones capable of handling the most complex, high-pressure, and high-temperature (HPHT) deepwater projects, which gives them a distinct technological edge over older, less-capable rigs.

3.  **Specialized Market Position (Jackup Dominance):** While competitors like Transocean focus heavily on ultra-deepwater, Valaris is a market leader in jackup rigs, especially in key regions like the North Sea and the Middle East. This segment diversity shields the company from downturns in a single market, a crucial difference from more specialized drillers.

4.  **Financial and Cost Advantage via Restructuring:** The company's most powerful advantage today is its **clean balance sheet**. Valaris emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021, which allowed it to eliminate over \$7 billion of debt, resetting its financial structure. This low-debt profile provides a significant cost advantage and capital flexibility over competitors still burdened by legacy debt, especially in an industry upcycle.

### **Pricing Power and Market Position**

1.  **Pricing Power is Asset-Specific and Cyclical:** Valaris has limited pricing power for its entire fleet due to the competitive nature of the industry and low direct switching costs between similarly-aged rigs. However, its premium 7th Generation drillships command **industry-leading day rates** (often over \$400,000 to \$500,000 per day) when global supply is tight, indicating significant pricing power for its best assets.

2.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts (Backlog):** The majority of Valaris's revenue comes from long-term, multi-year drilling contracts, resulting in a large contract backlog (around \$4.7 billion as of mid-2025). This backlog provides a long runway of predictable, sticky, and recurring revenue.

3.  **Customer Relationships and Operational Track Record:** Customers, who are often major international and national oil companies (IOCs/NOCs), prioritize safety and operational excellence to avoid costly project delays. Valaris has a long-standing reputation for performance, having been rated first in total customer satisfaction for multiple years, which acts as a powerful, non-financial barrier to entry. The top five customers accounted for nearly half of the company's 2024 revenue, highlighting the stickiness of these relationships.

### **Historical Growth and Ease of Displacement**

1.  **Reason for Current Scale (Merger):** Valaris grew to its current size and diverse fleet composition through a strategy of industry consolidation, most notably the **2019 merger of Ensco and Rowan**. The merger successfully combined Ensco’s strength in ultra-deepwater floaters with Rowan’s leading position in high-specification jackups, which is the foundational reason for the company's dual market leadership.

2.  **Displacement by Capital is Difficult:** While drilling is capital-intensive, a new competitor with only capital would struggle to displace Valaris. The sheer cost to build a comparable modern fleet today is extremely high (a new 7th Generation drillship costs over \$850 million). Furthermore, the barrier to entry is not just capital, but the **20+ year operational track record, safety systems, and customer relationships** needed to secure multi-billion dollar drilling contracts with major oil companies.

3.  **Limited Direct Network Effects:** Valaris does not have a software-style network effect where the product gets better as more customers use it. Its advantage is a **reputation/trust network effect**: as a trusted operator with the largest, most capable fleet, it is the first choice for the biggest, highest-margin global projects.

### **R&D and Innovation Strategy**

1.  **Innovation Focus on Upgrades and Efficiency:** Valaris does not invest heavily in "R&D" in the traditional sense of inventing entirely new drilling technology, which is often developed by oilfield service providers. Instead, its capital expenditure (CapEx) is focused on constantly **upgrading, maintaining, and reactivating** its high-specification fleet to meet the latest customer technical demands.

2.  **Innovation is about Operational Edge:** The need to innovate is primarily related to achieving a superior **operational edge**, measured by "revenue efficiency" (the amount of contracted time the rig is actually working). Valaris consistently achieves a high fleet-wide revenue efficiency (around 96%), proving that its focus on constant upgrades and operational excellence translates directly into higher utilization and better margins, thereby strengthening its competitive position.

---

## Catalyst Analysis

The stock price catalysts for Valaris Limited (VAL) stem primarily from the ongoing upcycle in the offshore drilling industry, driven by rising day rates and high-specification fleet utilization.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)**

1.  **Rising Day Rates and Backlog Growth:** The company continues to announce new, long-term contracts for its high-specification rigs at significantly improved day rates. The backlog has shown a consistent increase, totaling over $\$4.3$ billion as of mid-2024, which provides strong revenue visibility.

2.  **Performance of High-Specification Fleet:** Valaris is seeing a direct benefit from its focus on modern, seventh-generation drillships, which are achieving day rates approximately 25% higher than older rigs. As more of their fleet contracts transition from older, lower rates to current market rates, it should boost earnings and cash flow.

3.  **Increased Financial Guidance and Profitability:** The company has reported strong financial results, including robust revenue growth and a raised full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $\$565$–$\$605$ million. Continued operational excellence and strong revenue efficiency (96% in a recent quarter) are crucial for near-term outperformance.

4.  **North Sea Jackup Market Recovery:** Management has noted early signs of a recovery in the North Sea jackup market beginning in 2025, which, if confirmed by more contract awards at improving economics, could be a positive catalyst for their jackup fleet segment.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (1-3+ Years)**

1.  **Deepwater Project Sanctioning:** Management holds a strong conviction in the duration of the current upcycle, anticipating significant growth in deepwater project sanctioning, particularly in the 2026-2027 period. This is expected to drive long-term demand for their ultra-deepwater drillships.

2.  **Strategic Fleet Management and Deleveraging:** The company's strategy includes optimizing its fleet by selling non-core or older assets, such as the three semisubmersible rigs sold in Q2 2025. This focus on a modern, high-spec fleet and strengthening the balance sheet will provide stability and future growth capacity.

3.  **Operating Leverage and Cash Flow Deployment:** As high-day-rate contracts start and operating leverage takes effect, management's ability to convert increased earnings into robust cash flow will be key. This cash flow can be used for strategic investments, debt reduction, or potential shareholder returns, which are all long-term catalysts.

4.  **Role in Global Energy Needs (Management Strategy):** CEO Anton Dibowitz has consistently emphasized that offshore production will play a "vital role" in meeting the world's energy needs, which supports the long-term rationale for expanding and investing in their offshore drilling services.

The management analysis for Valaris Limited (VAL) focuses heavily on the post-restructuring team, which has steered the company through a significant industry up-cycle.

### I. Current CEO & Management Background

1.  **CEO and Experience:** The current President and CEO is Anton Dibowitz, appointed in December 2021 (after serving as interim CEO since September 2021). He brings over 20 years of drilling industry experience, having previously served as CEO of rival Seadrill Ltd. from 2017 to 2020 and holding various senior commercial roles at Seadrill and Transocean Ltd.
2.  **Key Management Team:** The executive management is highly experienced, with leaders like Chief Operating Officer Gilles Luca (since 2019, joined a predecessor company, Ensco, in 1997) and Chief Financial Officer Chris Weber having deep industry and financial experience, often with predecessor companies or competitors.
3.  **Alignment with Shareholders:** Mr. Dibowitz maintains direct ownership in the company's shares, aligning his financial interests with those of shareholders.

### II. Track Record, Key Decisions, and Performance Delivery

1.  **Post-Bankruptcy Financial Reset:** The management team, under former CEO Tom Burke, successfully led the company through Chapter 11 restructuring (emerged May 2021), a monumental decision that eliminated approximately \$7.1 billion of pre-petition debt and secured a \$520 million capital injection.
2.  **Operational Excellence and Efficiency:** Under the current management, the company has delivered a strong track record of operational performance, evidenced by a 97% revenue efficiency in 2022. Valaris was also recognized as the highest-ranked offshore driller in the 2022 EnergyPoint Research customer satisfaction survey, indicating good execution and customer relations.
3.  **Delivery on Rig Reactivations:** Management has successfully delivered on a key strategic promise by reactivating six floaters (drillships/semis) "largely on time and on budget" for multi-year contracts, a critical and challenging task in the industry.
4.  **Shareholder Value Creation:** Management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders is demonstrated by the significant increase in the share repurchase program authorization to \$600 million by February 2024. They have also executed value-accretive jackup sales to free up capital, generating over \$150 million.
5.  **Contracting Success:** The focus on winning long-term work has resulted in a substantial increase in the contract backlog, which grew more than tenfold for the drillship fleet between the company's re-listing in May 2021 and early 2024.

### III. Previous Management Change

1.  **The Transition:** Former CEO Tom Burke stepped down in September 2021, shortly after the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. CFO Jon Baksht also stepped down at the same time.
2.  **Reason for Change (Strategic Shift):** The change coincided with the successful completion of the financial restructuring phase. This timing suggests a deliberate transition by the Board from a leader focused on debt restructuring (Tom Burke) to a leader with deep commercial and operational experience (Anton Dibowitz) best suited to capitalize on the ensuing industry up-cycle and drive strategic growth.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Valaris Limited's most recent proxy statements (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure generally aligns with shareholder interests, though the low insider ownership is a notable area of concern.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (VAL)**

#### **1. Compensation Structure and Alignment with Performance**

*   **Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:** The compensation program is heavily weighted towards variable, at-risk pay, which directly supports a pay-for-performance philosophy. For the CEO, approximately **88%** of the target total compensation is performance-based or "at-risk," and this figure is around **74%** for the other Named Executive Officers (NEOs).
*   **Long-Term Focus (LTI):** The majority of the annual equity awards are granted as Performance Share Units (PSUs) (e.g., 80% of 2024 annual equity awards), with the remainder as time-based Restricted Share Units (RSUs), all vesting over a three-year period. This weighting toward PSUs directly links a greater portion of potential executive wealth to long-term company performance.
*   **Shareholder Value Metrics:** The PSUs are earned based on the attainment of challenging, multi-year performance targets, including **Cumulative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** and share price attainment, which directly track the return for common shareholders. Previous awards have also included Adjusted Operating Income (Adj. OI) growth goals.
*   **Short-Term Incentive Metrics (VCIP):** The annual cash incentive plan (VCIP) is tied to a balance of operational and financial metrics, including **Adjusted EBITDA**, **operating free cash flow**, **downtime performance**, and important Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors like **safety** and **spill prevention**.

#### **2. Insider Ownership and Management Skin in the Game**

*   **Low Insider Ownership:** The collective beneficial ownership of all executive officers and directors as a group is notably **less than 1%** of the company's common shares outstanding.
*   **Interpretation:** While this figure does not include the unvested portion of equity awards, the low level of *direct* ownership of common stock suggests that the personal, established wealth of the management team is not deeply concentrated in the company's existing shares, relying more on future vesting.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentives (Shareholders vs. Self-Interest)**

*   **Strong Incentive for Shareholder Interest:** The compensation structure is well-designed to align management's interests with those of shareholders for **future value creation** due to the high percentage of **at-risk pay** and the use of **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** as a primary Long-Term Incentive metric.
*   **Potential Weakness for Alignment:** The extremely **low combined insider ownership** indicates a relative lack of personal "skin in the game" compared to companies where executives and directors own a substantial personal stake in the common stock. This reliance on *future* equity grants rather than *existing* personal investment is a potential governance weakness, but one that is mitigated by the robust stock ownership guidelines and the heavy use of performance-based equity awards (PSUs).

## Price History

Based on the analysis of recent price data and technical indicators for **Valaris Limited (VAL)**, here is an overview of its price history and technical standing.

### **Price History and Technical Analysis for Valaris Limited (VAL)**

1.  **Current Price Context:** The stock is currently trading in the **upper half** of its 52-week range, with a recent trading price around **\$49.47** (as of late September 2025), compared to its 52-week range of **\$27.15 to \$57.45**.
2.  **Distance from 52-Week Low:** The stock is significantly higher than its 52-week low, currently trading approximately **82.2%** above the 52-week low of \$27.15.
3.  **Technical Analysis - Trading Low:** Based on technical analysis, the stock is **not trading low**. Its price is above its key longer-term moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which generally suggests a bullish or "Buy" signal for those long-term indicators.
4.  **Technical Sentiment:** The overall technical sentiment is mixed but leaning positive; while the longer-term Moving Averages (MA) indicate a "Buy" signal, the shorter-term MAs (5-day, 10-day, 20-day) may signal a "Sell" due to recent price dips from a high. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 51.46, which is a **Neutral** reading, indicating the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
5.  **Recent Price Movement (Up Bigly):** The stock has experienced a strong upward trend from around March 2025, rebounding after a decline that lasted from July 2024. This upward surge has been driven by strong fundamental performance and operational momentum.
6.  **Reason for the Rise:** The positive surge is largely attributed to Valaris's strong operating results in the first and second quarters of 2025, which surpassed analysts' earnings and revenue estimates. The company has secured new multi-year contract awards, and it is leveraging its cleaner balance sheet and high-tech rigs after emerging from bankruptcy.
7.  **Past Drops:** A stock price decline from July 2024 through March 2025 was primarily influenced by broader market volatility in the offshore drilling sector, industry-wide sector rotation, and some short-term operational challenges.
8.  **Industry Headwinds:** In late 2024, the stock's price faced challenges and stagnation as oil prices dropped from above \$80 to around \$71 a barrel, which can translate to reduced demand from oil producers for Valaris's drilling services.

## Long Thesis

Valaris is poised for massive financial growth because the global offshore drilling market is experiencing a multi-year boom (an upcycle). In the near term, the company is capitalizing on this boom by securing new, highly profitable contracts for its best rigs at record daily rental fees (day rates). Since Valaris successfully used bankruptcy to eliminate billions in debt, the vast majority of this surging revenue flows directly to the bottom line, quickly building up cash. This low-debt structure gives Valaris a significant advantage over competitors. Long term, the bull case suggests the deepwater drilling cycle will last many years, driven by major global energy companies committing to large, multi-year projects. Valaris, having the largest fleet of high-tech rigs, will dominate the market and maintain high utilization. Management plans to use this flood of operational cash flow to strategically upgrade the best rigs and return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks, leading to compounding value growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that global oil and natural gas prices remain high enough (likely above $70 per barrel) to incentivize major oil companies to sanction and fund expensive, long-term offshore drilling projects. Second, the current offshore drilling upcycle must prove durable and last for several years, rather than collapsing due to a sudden global recession or supply surge. Third, the company must maintain its stellar operational performance (high revenue efficiency) and successfully execute the remaining reactivations of its high-specification rigs without significant cost overruns. Finally, the long-term energy transition must not accelerate fast enough over the next five years to make deepwater exploration economically obsolete.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Valaris is robust in identifying the current offshore drilling upcycle. However, the bull case makes strong assumptions about the *longevity* and *purity* of the revenue flow, which are subject to significant cyclical and operational risks.

Here are the holes and faults in the thesis, which form the basis of a bear case:

1.  **Risk of an Upcycle Correction and Day Rate Volatility:** While the upcycle is real, some industry forecasts suggest the market may be entering a "correction phase" in the near future, which includes a forecast for **downward pressure on dayrates** and a slowdown in global rig demand after a strong 2024. The assumption of constantly surging day rates may be over-optimistic, as high project costs can cause operators to delay final investment decisions (FIDs), leading to a demand pause and weakening the market.

2.  **Uncertainty of Reactivation Costs and Margin Erosion:** The thesis claims "surging revenue flows directly to the bottom line," but the company must first successfully and profitably reactivate its stacked, high-specification rigs. **Rig reactivation costs have been substantial**, nearly doubling in certain quarters and contributing to net losses, showing that these major projects carry execution risk and high initial capital expenditure that can erode near-term profitability. Increased capital expenditures for upgrades and reactivations also use up cash that could otherwise go to shareholders.

3.  **"Low-Debt" Advantage is Muted by High Capital Demands:** While the company's bankruptcy eliminated old debt, new capital expenditures remain a major drain on cash. Recent company reports show cash decreased due to significant capital expenditures for rig upgrades and purchases, which competes with and limits the pace of the touted stock buybacks. This operational need for capital may restrict the full "return capital to shareholders" promised by the bull case, thereby slowing down the "compounding value growth."

4.  **Competitive Threat to "Market Dominance" Claim:** The thesis overstates Valaris's competitive position by suggesting it will "dominate the market." Valaris is one of the "Big 3" offshore drillers, along with Transocean and Noble Corp., which indicates a competitive oligopoly, not dominance. Competitors are securing contracts for newer-generation rigs (7th and 8th generation) at day rates **higher** than the averages cited for Valaris's 2026 fleet backlog, challenging Valaris's implied technological edge and leading-rate position in the highest-margin ultra-deepwater segment.

5.  **Extreme Sensitivity to Oil Prices and Macroeconomic Shocks:** The core assumption of oil prices remaining "high enough" is a significant risk. The offshore drilling industry is "highly sensitive to global oil and gas prices," and a sudden global recession or supply surge—like a change in OPEC+ policy or new geopolitical stability—could cause a sharp drop in oil prices, leading to project cancellations or delays that would severely impact Valaris's high-cost, long-term offshore projects.

---

### **Bear Case Thesis for Valaris Limited (VAL)**

Valaris's valuation does not fully account for the volatility and execution risk inherent in the offshore drilling industry, despite the current upcycle.

1.  **Cyclical Headwinds and Day Rate Plateau:** The multi-year boom may be peaking, with forecasts suggesting a potential **market correction and softening utilization/day rates** in the near future due to rising global project costs leading to customer delays. This would cap revenue growth sooner than the bull case projects, turning "surging revenue" into a plateau.
2.  **Eroding Margins from Operational Costs:** The cost and time associated with reactivating and upgrading Valaris's stacked fleet introduce substantial **operational risk and cost overruns**, which are a direct drain on cash flow and materially reduce the *true* profitability (free cash flow) from the high day rates.
3.  **Capital Allocation Conflict:** The need to fund aggressive capital expenditure for rig upgrades and reactivations will place an ongoing constraint on the cash available for the promised share buybacks. The resulting slower-than-expected capital return will fail to deliver the anticipated "compounding value growth" to shareholders.
4.  **Environmental/Long-Term Risk Underpriced:** The long-term risk of the energy transition accelerates faster than anticipated. As deepwater fields have decades-long lead times, a material shift in energy policy or sustained public pressure could lead to a permanent reduction in capital allocation by major oil companies, resulting in a **stranded asset risk** for Valaris's large fleet of deepwater rigs.

---

## Next Steps

The initial investigation has confirmed the strength of the bullish case with very recent data, but it also highlighted some concrete near-term risks that align with the bear case.

Here are the most important next steps to investigate and questions to answer:

1.  **ARO Drilling's True Valuation and Contribution:**
    *   **Question:** What is the full financial impact of the ARO Drilling joint venture, specifically its future contract backlog, cash flow distributions to Valaris, and its current fair market valuation?
    *   **Reasoning:** ARO Drilling is mentioned as a major tailwind and a source of stable revenue, with recent 5-year bareboat charter extensions announced for five jackups. However, the extent of its value to Valaris is a major, yet currently opaque, component of the bull case, which needs to be quantified beyond the listed backlog.

2.  **Specific Rig Reactivation Costs and Schedule:**
    *   **Question:** What is the remaining total capital expenditure (CapEx) for the reactivation of *uncontracted* or *newly contracted* stacked drillships/floaters, and is this cost fully covered by the recent CapEx guidance?
    *   **Reasoning:** The bear case flags high CapEx as a drain on free cash flow (FCF), while the bull case expects FCF to flow *directly* to the bottom line. The search results confirmed sales of older rigs for only $10 million, and a decrease in CapEx for Q2 2025, but specific future CapEx for remaining reactivations is still needed to validate the free cash flow potential.

3.  **Share Buyback Pace and Capital Return:**
    *   **Question:** What is the dollar amount of shares repurchased under the $600 million program as of the most recent quarterly report (Q2 2025), and what is the current outstanding share count?
    *   **Reasoning:** The bear case suggests CapEx will slow down the buybacks, while the long thesis hinges on "compounding value growth" via buybacks. Quantifying the actual pace of the share repurchase program will validate or refute the effectiveness of this key shareholder-friendly catalyst.

4.  **Competitive Threat from Newer Rigs (7th/8th Generation):**
    *   **Question:** What are the most recent publicly disclosed day rates and contract durations for **Transocean (RIG)** and **Noble Corp. (NE)**'s top-tier, 7th/8th Generation drillships, specifically for contracts commencing in 2026 and 2027?
    *   **Reasoning:** The analysis suggests Valaris's market dominance is challenged by competitors securing *higher* day rates. Comparing Valaris's recently announced rates (e.g., above $400,000) directly against its top peers' latest contract rates is critical to evaluating the moat and pricing power.

5.  **External Oil Price and Demand Forecasts (Longevity of Upcycle):**
    *   **Question:** What are the consensus analyst or independent research firm forecasts for deepwater rig utilization and day rates for the 2027–2030 period, and what are the associated long-term oil price assumptions required to sustain that demand?
    *   **Reasoning:** The bull case's core assumption is a multi-year, durable cycle. A long-term look at industry consensus will help ground this assumption, mitigating the risk of a sudden market correction (the bear case).

6.  **Near-Term Jackup Downtime Risk:**
    *   **Question:** What is the expected financial impact (in millions of dollars) of the projected zero-rate, six-month out-of-service periods for the two ARO-leased jackups (VALARIS 116 and 250) in late 2025/early 2026?
    *   **Reasoning:** The search revealed a concrete, scheduled downtime risk that will put a direct, albeit temporary, drag on revenue and cash flow, aligning with the bear case's operational risks. The magnitude of this headwind needs to be calculated.
