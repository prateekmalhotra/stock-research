## Business Summary

LKQ Corporation operates as a global parts middleman, providing essential components used in vehicle maintenance and collision repair. The core business involves acquiring damaged or end-of-life vehicles (salvage), dismantling them, inspecting the usable components (recycled parts), and distributing them to customers at a significant discount compared to brand-new parts from the original manufacturer. LKQ also sells new, non-original components (aftermarket parts) and refurbished mechanical parts. Their customer base is heavily B2B, consisting primarily of collision repair centers, mechanical repair garages, and insurance companies directing repairs, mainly located across North America and Europe. This model succeeds by offering a high-volume, cost-effective solution that reduces the overall expense of vehicle ownership and repair.

## Business Model Risk

LKQ faces significant near-term and long-term risks. Near term, the company is vulnerable to shifts in economic activity; if people drive less or if vehicles are declared total losses more frequently due to high repair costs, demand for recycled parts declines. The most crucial long-term risk relates to evolving vehicle technology. As cars become packed with complex electronics, sensors, and advanced safety features, the difficulty and cost of certifying and salvaging used parts increases. Historically, LKQ benefited greatly from high volumes of simpler gasoline cars. Now, the rising complexity, coupled with the shift toward electric vehicles (EVs)—which use fundamentally different, highly integrated, and difficult-to-recycle components—threatens LKQ's supply chain and reduces the profitability of traditional mechanical parts. This ongoing technological evolution raises concerns about the future availability of viable, recycled parts inventory and the cost of preparing them for market.

### **LKQ Corporation: The History**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose (1998)**

1.  **The Founder and The Vision:** LKQ Corporation was founded in 1998 by Donald Flynn, an executive who had previously consolidated the trash-hauling industry with Waste Management, Inc.
2.  **The Industry Problem:** Flynn saw a similar opportunity in the fragmented used auto parts industry, which was made up of over 11,000 small, independent salvage yards, many without modern systems or consistent quality standards.
3.  **The Founding Goal:** The business was founded to consolidate this messy, local industry into one large, efficient, and professional national network to provide high-quality, cost-effective replacement parts to collision and mechanical repair shops.
4.  **The Name's Meaning:** The company was named LKQ, which is industry shorthand for "Like, Kind, and Quality," a designation used for used parts considered to be functionally as good as new, emphasizing their commitment to quality.

#### **II. The Innovative Solution and Path to Dominance**

5.  **Strategy of Aggregation (The Solution):** LKQ's primary innovative strategy was rapid and aggressive consolidation, starting with its first three acquisitions in 1998. The company has since grown through hundreds of acquisitions of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished, and remanufactured product suppliers.
6.  **Creating a "One-Stop Shop":** This strategy created a massive, professional network, allowing LKQ to offer a "one-stop" solution with a broad range of products at costs typically 20% to 50% lower than new parts from the original vehicle manufacturer (OEM).
7.  **Expansion into Aftermarket and Specialty:** The company quickly expanded beyond recycled parts to include new "aftermarket" parts and specialty vehicle products and accessories, notably through the acquisition of Keystone Automotive in 2007.
8.  **Global Growth:** LKQ began its significant international expansion in 2011 with the acquisition of Euro Car Parts, the largest aftermarket parts distributor in the United Kingdom, establishing a strong presence across Europe.

#### **III. Tailwinds: Trends that Helped LKQ Grow**

9.  **The Value Proposition:** A major tailwind has always been the demand for cost-effective vehicle repair solutions, as insurance companies and vehicle owners consistently seek quality replacement parts at lower prices.
10. **Vehicle Longevity and Complexity:** The aging fleet of cars and trucks on the road ("aging parc") means more frequent and complex repairs are needed, driving demand for the replacement parts that LKQ distributes.
11. **Sustainability and Circularity:** LKQ has been a leader in recycling end-of-life vehicles since its founding, which aligns perfectly with the growing, modern focus on vehicle circularity and environmental sustainability.
12. **Strong Cash Flow:** The company has been fortunate to consistently generate robust free cash flow, even during difficult quarters, which provides the financial stability to fund its ongoing expansion and internal strategies.

#### **IV. Headwinds and Challenges**

13. **Integration Challenges:** A core difficulty of its acquisition-based growth model is the constant need to integrate and standardize the operations, technology, and staff of hundreds of different companies globally.
14. **Economic Sensitivity:** LKQ faces challenges from economic downturns that can lead to reduced consumer spending, and macroeconomic weakness, particularly in its large European market, which pressures sales.
15. **Falling Repair Claims (Current Challenge):** Recently, the company has struggled with a decline in North American repairable claims, which is attributed to factors like rising auto insurance premiums and falling used car values.
16. **Technological Disruption and Cost Squeeze:** The industry faces technological change, and LKQ has dealt with "negative operating leverage," where rising costs have been eating into its strong profit margins, requiring significant cost-cutting and efficiency measures.

#### **V. Present-Day Focus and Goal**

17. **Strategic Overhaul:** LKQ is currently undertaking a massive internal overhaul to simplify its global business structure, streamline operations, and boost overall efficiency to maintain profitability in a challenging market.
18. **Adapting to Electric Vehicles (EVs):** A future focus is on the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), requiring the company to strategically invest in remanufacturing capabilities for high-value components, like hybrid and EV batteries.
19. **The Core Business:** Today, LKQ Corporation remains a global distributor of vehicle replacement parts, accessories, and systems, operating in North America, Europe, and Taiwan, positioning itself as the leader in sustainable, value-driven automotive repair solutions.

## Moat Analysis

LKQ Corporation's competitive advantage, or "moat," is built on its unparalleled scale, logistics, and unique "one-stop-shop" product offering in a traditionally fragmented industry.

### **The Moat: Scale, Logistics, and Unique Product Mix**

1.  **Scale and Distribution Network:** LKQ's primary moat is its massive, established physical and logistical network, which includes approximately 1,700 facilities and hundreds of salvage yards globally. This extensive footprint allows for faster, more reliable parts delivery, giving it a significant edge over smaller, independent competitors who lack this infrastructure.
2.  **Unmatched Product Availability:** The company differentiates itself by offering a "one-stop-shop" solution that blends four key product categories: new aftermarket parts, recycled Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts, remanufactured, and refurbished parts. This broad inventory enables industry-leading "fill rates" (the ability to supply the requested part), which are significantly higher than its competitive set.
3.  **Differentiated Market Position:** LKQ is a dominant force in the supply of alternative collision parts, controlling a large share of the U.S. market for salvage and aftermarket collision products. The ability to offer a customer a choice between a new aftermarket part and a cheaper, available recycled OEM part is a key competitive advantage.

### **Pricing Power and Market Position**

1.  **Cost Advantage and Pricing Power:** Due to its massive scale and efficient recycling operations, LKQ can source and process parts at a lower cost than its competitors. This allows the company to offer high-quality alternative parts at prices typically **20% to 50% below** new OEM replacement parts, which is a major incentive for price-sensitive customers.
2.  **Special Position with Insurers:** The core of its competitive advantage lies in its strong relationships with large automobile insurance companies. Since insurers aim to minimize repair costs, they often influence repair shops to use LKQ's lower-cost, high-quality alternative parts, cementing LKQ's role as a preferred supplier in the automotive repair ecosystem.

### **Growth, Displacement Risk, and Customer Stickiness**

1.  **Reason for Growth (Consolidation Strategy):** The company’s growth into a market leader since 1998 was driven by a bold strategy of aggressively **acquiring and consolidating** the highly fragmented, local "mom-and-pop" salvage yard industry. It centralized these acquisitions with modern IT systems for inventory management, pricing, and logistics, turning a chaotic industry into a scalable and efficient empire.
2.  **High Displacement Risk Barrier:** It would be extremely difficult for a new competitor, even one with immense capital, to displace LKQ quickly. The vast capital needed to replicate LKQ's global network of thousands of physical facilities, establish the complex supply chain for both recycled and aftermarket parts, and build the necessary relationships with major insurance carriers is an enormous barrier to entry.
3.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Base:** LKQ’s business is highly recurring, built on deep relationships with thousands of collision and mechanical repair shops. Furthermore, the company solidifies this by negotiating multi-year **"primary provider" and "preferred supplier" contracts** with top-tier customers and major insurance carriers, ensuring a predictable and continuous flow of business.

### **Innovation and Moat Reinforcement**

1.  **Focus on Technology for Efficiency, Not Traditional R&D:** LKQ does not primarily invest in traditional R&D to invent new car parts. Instead, its technology focus is on **operational excellence**—using proprietary data and information systems to optimize procurement, manage its massive inventory, and assist its sales team with real-time pricing and availability.
2.  **Maintaining the Moat (Adaptation):** To maintain its edge, the company must constantly **adapt** its business and supply chain to changes in the automotive industry, such as electric vehicles (EVs), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and vehicle connectivity. For example, LKQ has a forward-looking strategy that includes expanding into EV battery remanufacturing and recycling.

## Catalyst Analysis

LKQ Corporation's catalysts stem primarily from strategic divestitures, operational efficiency programs, and stable demand for vehicle repair parts.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Sale of Self Service Segment:** The agreement to sell the North American Self Service segment (Pick Your Part) is a near-term catalyst. This sale will streamline the business, allow management to focus on higher-margin core segments (Wholesale North America and Europe), and is expected to unlock capital for other strategic purposes.
2.  **Operational Efficiencies in Europe (Margin Enhancement):** Management is actively pursuing strategic initiatives and cost-cutting measures in the European segment. Improved margins or a quick rebound in European volumes would be a significant positive surprise for the stock.
3.  **Upcoming Quarterly Earnings Results:** A beat on earnings or a positive revision to the company's full-year guidance would serve as an immediate catalyst, especially following the guidance cut after the Q2 2025 results.
4.  **Shareholder Returns:** Management has continued to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which can support the stock price.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)

1.  **Focus on Core Businesses (Portfolio Rationalization):** The strategy of divesting non-core or lower-margin assets, like the Self Service segment, helps concentrate resources on high-growth and high-margin segments, positioning the company for superior long-term growth and profitability.
2.  **Increased Free Cash Flow (FCF) Generation:** A key long-term catalyst is the company's goal to generate significant free cash flow. Management maintains a target of converting 50% to 60% of annual EBITDA into free cash flow, which provides capital for strategic investments, debt reduction, or increased shareholder returns.
3.  **Favorable Market Trends (Aging Vehicles):** As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, the demand for affordable alternative parts (recycled and aftermarket, which are LKQ's core products) naturally grows, providing a stable, long-term secular growth driver.
4.  **Integration of Alternative Energy Vehicle (AEV) Parts:** The company's long-term success relies on its ability to integrate and capture market share in parts and services for electric and other alternative energy vehicles, ensuring its parts supply chain remains relevant.

### Management's Explicitly Stated Strategy

Management's strategy, as noted in recent earnings calls, is focused on three main pillars:

*   **Profitable Revenue Growth:** Focus is placed on growing revenue in a profitable manner rather than volume at all costs.
*   **Margin Enhancement:** This includes ongoing cost-saving and efficiency initiatives, particularly in the European business segment.
*   **Cash Flow Generation and Capital Allocation:** The company emphasizes generating strong free cash flow and allocating that capital to the highest-return opportunities, including its core businesses and strategic divestitures.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of LKQ Corporation's (LKQ) recent proxy statements (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure demonstrates a mixed but generally well-governed approach, heavily relying on performance-based pay to align with shareholder interests.

### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

1.  **Low Direct Insider Ownership:** The total beneficial ownership by all insiders (managers and directors) is reported to be very low, at approximately **0.45%** of the company's shares.
2.  **Weak Personal Alignment:** This low ownership percentage is typically viewed as a **weak** form of alignment, as a small personal stake means the management's direct, personal wealth is not heavily dependent on the stock's long-term performance (i.e., higher ownership is generally better).
3.  **Stock Ownership Guidelines:** To counterbalance the low absolute ownership, LKQ maintains stock ownership guidelines for its directors and executive officers to further align their interests with stockholders.

### **Executive Compensation Structure**

4.  **High Performance-Based Pay:** LKQ's compensation program features a high degree of performance-based incentive compensation; for instance, the CEO's total yearly compensation is structured with roughly 20% base salary and approximately **80% in incentive-based compensation**, including stock and options.
5.  **Robust Performance Metrics:** The annual and long-term incentive plans are tied to a diverse and robust set of financial performance measures, which directly link pay to operational and financial success.
6.  **Focus on Shareholder Value Drivers:** Key metrics used for determining incentive payouts and stock vesting include **Adjusted Diluted EPS**, **Free Cash Flow**, and **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**, alongside growth metrics like Organic Parts and Services Revenue Growth, and profitability metrics like EBITDA. The inclusion of ROIC and Free Cash Flow is a **strong** indicator of incentivizing long-term, capital-efficient growth that benefits shareholders.

### **Conclusion on Management Incentive and Alignment**

7.  **Strong Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest:** The compensation structure is heavily weighted toward incentive pay (80% of CEO's total), and the performance metrics used (**EPS, ROIC, Free Cash Flow**) are well-aligned with the metrics shareholders use to value a company. This structure provides a powerful **financial incentive** to focus on profitable growth and efficient capital use.
8.  **Mitigation of Self-Enrichment Risk:** The company's governance practices, which include **prohibiting pledging or hedging** of company securities, further mitigate the risk of managers taking on excessive risk or being incentivized to just "line their own pockets" with short-term gains.
9.  **Overall Assessment:** While the direct insider ownership is low (0.45%), the **strong design of the performance-based compensation plan**—using long-term value metrics and a high percentage of equity—suggests that LKQ's management is fundamentally **incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders**.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of LKQ Corporation (LKQ) stock price history and technical indicators (data as of a recent close near $30.39, with the 52-week low set in August 2025), here is an analysis:

### LKQ Corporation (LKQ) Price History and Technical Analysis

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** LKQ Corporation's stock has a recent 52-week low of **\$28.92** and a high of **\$44.82** set earlier in the year. Based on a recent closing price of **\$30.39**, the stock is currently trading approximately **5.08%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis Status (Trading Low):** The stock is technically trading low and facing selling pressure. Multiple technical indicators, including the 8-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMAs/EMAs), were signaling a **"Sell"** or **"Strong Sell"** in recent analyses.

3.  **Bearish Trend Indication:** The technical trend is considered **strongly bearish** because the share price has recently been below its key short-term moving averages (5, 20, and 50-day EMAs), indicating a risk of further downward movement. The stock is noted to have fallen below critical support levels.

4.  **Significant Stock Drop:** The stock experienced a significant decline from its peak earlier in the year, culminating in the recent 52-week low set in August 2025. Over the past year, the stock price had decreased by over 25%.

5.  **Reason for Recent Drop (Earnings Miss):** A major catalyst for the recent downward pressure was the company's Q2 2025 earnings report, where the Earnings Per Share (EPS) of \$0.87 **missed** the forecast of \$0.92, which was a negative surprise of 5.70%. The earnings miss, combined with a revised full-year outlook, prompted a negative market reaction.

6.  **Reason for Recent Drop (Macro & Strategic Factors):** Broader economic concerns also contributed, as rising inflation and interest rates can lead to decreased consumer spending on vehicle repairs and parts, affecting demand in the automotive sector. Additionally, the company is simplifying its portfolio, including the announced sale of its Self Service segment for \$410 million, with proceeds planned for debt repayment.

## Long Thesis

LKQ is the dominant global middleman for used and aftermarket car parts, operating a massive, highly efficient distribution network that competitors cannot easily replicate. The core bull case rests on three factors: 1) Scale Advantage: LKQ’s huge physical footprint and preferred supplier relationships with major insurance companies—who constantly seek the lowest repair costs—ensure a continuous, reliable flow of high-margin business. 2) Operational Cleanup: New, experienced management is aggressively streamlining operations by selling low-margin segments (like the recent Self Service sale) and focusing resources entirely on core, high-margin wholesale distribution. This restructuring, coupled with cost efficiencies, is expected to immediately boost profit margins and free cash flow generation. 3) Secular Demand and Adaptation: As cars age and repairs become more complex and expensive, demand for LKQ’s cheaper, recycled parts (20% to 50% less than new) remains strong. The company is actively investing in new capabilities, such as remanufacturing EV batteries, ensuring it captures value and remains relevant as the vehicle fleet modernizes, driving profitable long-term growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumptions are that management successfully executes its multi-year operational overhaul and efficiency programs, especially stabilizing and improving margins in the European segment. We also assume that LKQ successfully adapts its supply chain to profitably handle complex new vehicle technology (EVs, ADAS sensors) and that the crucial demand drivers—the aging vehicle fleet and the insurance industry's continued need to minimize repair costs—remain intact and secularly positive. Finally, global macroeconomic stability is assumed, preventing widespread consumer repair deferrals.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the major holes and faults in the long thesis for LKQ Corporation, providing a counter-argument and bear case based on current market data and industry trends.

## **Critique and Bear Case Thesis for LKQ Corporation (LKQ)**

The bull case fundamentally overstates the durability of LKQ's "scale advantage" in the face of technological disruption and underestimates the immediate impact of macroeconomic and OEM headwinds on its core profitability and growth.

### **Critique of the Long Thesis Pillars**

| Long Thesis Point | Flaw/Hole in the Argument | Corroborating Bear Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1) Scale Advantage: Dominant Global Middleman** | This ignores the growing and more critical risk from **vertical integration** by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and powerful competitors in the mechanical and European markets. | **OEM Technology Lock-Out:** Manufacturers are employing software-based security, like **"VIN burning"** on control modules, to prevent the reuse or remanufacture of salvaged electronic parts, thereby locking the high-margin market to new OEM parts only. This directly undermines LKQ's supply of high-value recycled components. |
| **2) Operational Cleanup: Immediate Margin/FCF Boost** | The aggressive restructuring is being conducted against stronger-than-expected macro headwinds, meaning the benefits are offset by underlying market weakness, not leading to the anticipated immediate boost. | **Organic Revenue Decline:** Despite cost-cutting, LKQ reported a decline in organic revenue for parts and services in 2024, and its outlook for 2025 projects an organic decline of up to 3.5%, directly contradicting the assumption of a robust and intact demand environment. |
| **3) Secular Demand and Adaptation: Profitable Long-Term Growth** | The two main technological trends—ADAS and EVs—that LKQ is adapting to are, in the short-to-medium term, more of a threat to their core business volume than a source of immediate, profitable growth. | **Shrinking Collision Market:** Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in newer vehicles are designed to *prevent* accidents, with ADAS-equipped vehicles (projected to be over 90% of new vehicles by 2030) expected to **reduce the number of accident repairs**, shrinking the core collision repair volume that generates most of LKQ's high-margin business. |
| **Assumption: Crucial Demand Drivers Remain Intact** | This is directly contradicted by financial performance, suggesting a weak repair environment and consumer repair deferrals are already taking place. | **Weak Claims Environment:** The North American business, while outperforming the market, saw a 9% decline in repairable claims industry-wide, confirming a downturn in the crucial insurance-driven collision volume. |

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for LKQ Corporation (LKQ)**

The primary bear case is that LKQ’s legacy business model is facing simultaneous structural and cyclical pressures that will continue to compress margins and revenue growth, making the stock a value trap based on operational improvement hopes.

1.  **Structural Headwinds from New Vehicle Technology (EV/ADAS)**
    *   The company’s core business model of selling replacement parts faces a secular decline as Electric Vehicles (EVs) require up to **40% fewer parts** for maintenance and repair than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, leading to a shrinking total addressable market over the next decade.
    *   The adoption of ADAS will reduce accident frequency, dampening demand for LKQ’s highest-margin collision parts, while OEMs aggressively use technical barriers (e.g., VIN-locked electronic modules) to monopolize the complex, high-margin repair and calibration market for salvaged parts.

2.  **Cyclical and Macro-Driven Revenue Contraction**
    *   Despite management’s efforts to streamline, the negative macroeconomic environment has resulted in organic revenue decline in parts and services for 2024, and management lowered its 2025 outlook to an anticipated decline of up to 3.5%, indicating that market weakness is outweighing operational efficiency.
    *   The slowdown in organic revenue, alongside a decline in repairable claims, suggests that the key assumption of robust secular demand is faulty, and consumers and insurers are already deferring repairs or seeking cheaper, non-LKQ solutions.

3.  **Capital Intensity and Competitive Pressure on Adaptation**
    *   The move into EV battery remanufacturing, while necessary, is a capital-intensive, high-risk endeavor that will require significant upfront investment with no immediate guarantee of attractive long-term profitability to replace the lost income from traditional parts.
    *   LKQ faces stiff competition from established, well-capitalized aftermarket rivals (Genuine Parts Company, AutoZone) and local players who can erode margins in its wholesale parts business, constantly challenging its "dominant" status and efficiency claims.

## Next Steps

The current analysis provides a strong qualitative framework for LKQ Corporation, including the bull and bear cases, but it lacks specific, up-to-date quantitative data and deeper structural validation of key risks and catalysts.

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate, focusing on a deep dive into financials and validating the technological risks.

### **Next Steps for Investigation (Unanswered Questions)**

1.  **Competitive and Valuation Benchmarking:**
    *   **Question:** How does LKQ's valuation truly compare to its closest wholesale/distribution peers?
    *   **Action:** Compare the current **EV/EBITDA** (approx. 8.0x) and **Forward P/E** (approx. 9.4x) to those of publicly traded competitors like Genuine Parts Company (GPC) and AutoZone. This is crucial for determining if the current low trading price is an undervaluation or a reflection of its lower growth outlook. The initial search shows LKQ's TTM P/E (11.12) is lower than GPC's (23.9), but a direct EV/EBITDA comparison to GPC is needed for a capital-structure-neutral view.
    *   **Question:** Is the scale moat translating to superior profitability?
    *   **Action:** Conduct a direct comparison of **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** (currently 6.44%) and Segment Operating Margins between LKQ's core North American and European wholesale segments and its peers. This will validate if its scale advantage creates a true, durable efficiency edge.

2.  **Structural and Operational Risk Deep Dive (Europe and Technology):**
    *   **Question:** What are the *specific structural problems* plaguing the European segment beyond general "macro weakness?"
    *   **Action:** Investigate the underlying issues in the European segment. While the company is working on centralization and has replaced 25% of the leadership team, understanding if the issue is market fragmentation, aggressive pricing competition, high logistics costs, or integration failures from past acquisitions is key to assessing the success of the turnaround.
    *   **Question:** How immediate and widespread is the OEM technical lock-out (e.g., VIN-burning of ECUs)?
    *   **Action:** Research the actual prevalence and current status of **OEM software restrictions** and the **"Right to Repair"** movement globally, particularly in LKQ’s markets. This will quantify the bear case's main technical risk to LKQ's supply of high-margin recycled electronic parts.

3.  **Capital Allocation and Balance Sheet Discipline:**
    *   **Question:** What is the full financial impact of the Self Service segment sale and the new CEO's capital plan?
    *   **Action:** Track the announced sale of the Self Service segment and the final plan for the proceeds. The current leverage is around 2.6x EBITDA, and the sale's purpose is deleveraging. Confirm the projected leverage ratio *after* the $410 million sale closes to assess the new management's balance sheet discipline and future acquisition capacity.
    *   **Question:** How much capital is being *reserved* or *invested* in the EV/AEV strategy, and what is the target return?
    *   **Action:** Quantify the stated investment in EV battery remanufacturing and other Alternative Energy Vehicle (AEV) parts, including expected capital expenditure (CapEx) over the next two years. This is essential to judge the viability of the long-term growth catalyst.

4.  **Forecasting and Guidance Analysis:**
    *   **Question:** Given the revised 2025 outlook (up to 3.5% organic revenue decline), how are analysts forecasting the return to organic growth?
    *   **Action:** Investigate the consensus estimates for organic growth and margin expansion for 2026 and beyond. A successful long thesis depends on management's ability to halt the organic decline and return to growth, so the market's expectation for this inflection point needs to be understood.
