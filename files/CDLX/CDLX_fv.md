### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

Cardlytics' business engine is driven by **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)** and the **Billings per MAU (B-ARPU)**. Revenue is derived from Billings, which represents the total value of rewards/offers delivered before deducting the Financial Institution (FI) partner share and the direct consumer incentive. Management's "Northstar" is consumer rewards, meaning higher incentives are being paid out to drive engagement, which dampens the reported Revenue/ARPU, but the core Gross Profit is the Adjusted Contribution (AC). Therefore, the forecast focuses on **Billings** and the resulting **Adjusted Contribution margin**.

| Metric | 2024 (Actual) | 2025 (Projected) | 2026 (Projected) | 2027 (Projected) | 2028 (Projected) | 2029 (Projected) | 2030 (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MAUs (Millions)** | 166.9 | 168.6 | 170.3 | 172.0 | 173.7 | 175.5 | 177.3 |
| **MAU Growth (YoY)** | 3.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% |
| **B-ARPU (Annual)** | \$2.66 | \$2.77 | \$2.88 | \$3.00 | \$3.12 | \$3.25 | \$3.38 |
| **B-ARPU Growth (YoY)** | - | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% |
| **Billings (Millions)** | **\$443.8** | **\$467.5** | **\$491.9** | **\$516.4** | **\$542.4** | **\$569.5** | **\$597.9** |

#### **Justification for Revenue Engine Assumptions (Conservative)**

1.  **MAU Growth (1.0%):** MAUs for the full year 2024 were up 3.0%, but Q4 2024 saw a slight decrease due to winding down a partner. The company is signing new FI partners. A very conservative 1.0% annual growth rate is assumed, accounting for potential churn and slow ramp-up of new partners, which aligns with the "conservative" rule.
2.  **B-ARPU Growth (4.0%):** B-ARPU for 2024 was \$2.66. As the platform matures, integrates Bridg technology (identity resolution) and signs more national brands on engagement-based pricing, the core advertising spend (Billings) should increase. A 4.0% compounded growth rate is conservative, given the goal of increasing engagement and advertiser budgets.
3.  **Revenue Projection:** Revenue = Billings * Revenue %

### **3. Margin Projections and Net Income (2025 - 2030)**

The company's focus on profitability and cost discipline is a key management commentary.

| Metric | 2024 (Actual) | 2025 (Projected) | 2026 (Projected) | 2027 (Projected) | 2028 (Projected) | 2029 (Projected) | 2030 (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adj. Contribution / Billings (%) (AC%)**| 33.9% | 34.0% | 35.0% | 36.0% | 37.0% | 38.0% | 40.0% |
| **Adj. Contribution (AC) (Millions)** | **\$150.5** | **\$159.0** | **\$172.2** | **\$185.9** | **\$200.7** | **\$216.4** | **\$239.2** |
| **Net Income Margin (%) of Revenue** | -44.1% | -10.0% | 0.0% | 1.0% | 3.0% | 4.0% | 5.0% |
| **Revenue / Billings (%) (Rev%)** | 62.7% | 61.0% | 60.0% | 59.0% | 58.0% | 57.0% | 56.0% |
| **Revenue (Millions)** | **\$278.3** | **\$285.4** | **\$295.1** | **\$304.7** | **\$314.6** | **\$324.6** | **\$334.8** |
| **Net Income (Millions)**| **(\$122.8)** | **(\$28.5)** | **\$0.0** | **\$3.0** | **\$9.4** | **\$13.0** | **\$16.7** |

#### **Justification for Margin Assumptions**

1.  **Adjusted Contribution / Billings (AC%):** The TTM AC% is 33.9%. This is projected to increase modestly to 40.0% by 2030. This is conservative, assuming efficiency gains from the new Cardlytics/Bridg platform and better advertiser monetization.
2.  **Revenue / Billings (Rev%):** This ratio is declining as the company increases *Consumer Incentives* (the "Northstar"), which is a deduction from Billings to get Revenue. It is projected to decline from 62.7% to 56.0% by 2030, a conservative assumption that higher consumer rewards will continue to depress reported revenue.
3.  **Net Income Margin:** The company was unprofitable but achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 (\$0.2 million) and positive operating cash flow in Q4 2024 (\$3.0 million). This suggests a path to profitability. A projection to reach a conservative **5.0% Net Income Margin of Revenue** by 2030 is reasonable, acknowledging the risks and assuming successful execution of the turnaround plan.

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

**Assumption:**
*   **ROIC:** A conservative positive ROIC of **3.0%** is used, given the TTM ROIC is negative (-12.25%). This assumes a minimal return on accumulated cash.
*   **Terminal/Maturity Growth Rate:** A very conservative **2.0%** is used.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative but reasonable **12.0%** is used, reflecting the company's high-risk profile, history of unprofitability, and high debt load.

| Year | Net Income (A) | Previous Year Cash (B) | ROIC on Previous Cash (B * 3.0%) (C) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) | Discount Factor (12.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | (\$28.5) | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | (\$28.5) | 0.8929 | (\$25.4) |
| **2026** | \$0.0 | (\$28.5) | (\$0.9) | (\$0.9) | 0.7972 | (\$0.7) |
| **2027** | \$3.0 | (\$29.4) | (\$0.9) | \$2.1 | 0.7118 | \$1.5 |
| **2028** | \$9.4 | (\$27.3) | (\$0.8) | \$8.6 | 0.6355 | \$5.5 |
| **2029** | \$13.0 | (\$18.7) | (\$0.6) | \$12.4 | 0.5674 | \$7.0 |
| **2030** | \$16.7 | (\$6.3) | (\$0.2) | \$16.5 | 0.5066 | \$8.4 |
| **Sum of NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)**| | | | | | **\$(\$3.7) million** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**
*   **Terminal Cash Flow (2031 Estimate):** Net Income 2030 * (1 + 2.0%) = \$16.7 * 1.02 = \$17.0 million
*   **Terminal Value Formula:** (Terminal Cash Flow) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   **Terminal Value:** \$17.0 / (0.12 - 0.02) = \$170.0 million
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (Discounted to Today):** \$170.0 * 0.5066 (2030 Discount Factor) = **\$86.1 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
*   \$(\$3.7) million (2025-2030 NPV) + \$86.1 million (Terminal Value NPV) = **\$82.4 million**

### **5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

| Metric | Calculation | Value (Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | \$82.4 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | | \$65.6 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | | (\$213.9) |
| **Total Equity Value** | NPV + Cash - Debt | **\$(\$65.9) million** |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | | 53.493 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding | **\$(\$1.23)** |

### **6. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share:** **\$(\$1.23)**

**Current Stock Price:** **\$0.93**

The calculated Fair Value Per Share is negative, indicating that the present value of the company's projected future cash flows, even with conservative long-term growth and a path to profitability, is insufficient to cover the company's current total debt.

**Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Price):**

The market price of **\$0.93** is significantly higher than the calculated negative fair value. This discrepancy suggests the market is making a few different, and much more optimistic, assumptions than my conservative DCF model:

1.  **Higher Growth Rate / Faster Turnaround:** The market is likely pricing in a faster and more aggressive ramp-up of the turnaround plan. My projection of 1.0% MAU growth and 4.0% B-ARPU growth might be too conservative. The market may assume that new FI partners and product improvements (Bridg integration) will lead to MAU/ARPU growth rates exceeding 10% per year for a sustained period.
2.  **Higher Terminal Value / Margins:** The market assumes Cardlytics will achieve a significantly higher long-term Net Income Margin (e.g., 10-15%) rather than my conservative 5.0% by 2030, or that the cost of capital (Discount Rate) is lower than 12.0%, which would dramatically increase the Terminal Value.
3.  **Debt Restructuring/Conversion:** The majority of the debt is in the form of convertible senior notes. The market may be assuming:
    *   The notes will be converted to equity (leading to massive dilution, but eliminating the debt). My calculation does not factor in this dilution or the potential conversion price, but assumes the debt must be paid off or refinanced.
    *   The company will successfully refinance the debt at a favorable rate, or the debt holders are not immediately concerned with repayment due to the equity cushion (though the current market cap is low).

**Conclusion on Market's Assumptions:**

The market is betting on the successful execution of the management's turnaround strategy, specifically the ability to grow **Billings** and, more importantly, to achieve sustained, substantial **Net Income Margins** through operating leverage as revenue scales, rapidly moving from Adjusted EBITDA breakeven to significant GAAP profitability. The market is ignoring the current debt burden in favor of this future growth story, or banking on a non-cash conversion of the debt. My analysis, strictly adhering to conservative accounting for debt and modest growth, concludes the company is currently overleveraged relative to its projected cash flows, hence the negative fair value.
