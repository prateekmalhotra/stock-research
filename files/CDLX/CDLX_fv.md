### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Cardlytics is driven by **Monthly Qualified Users (MQUs)** and **Adjusted Contribution Per User (ACPU)**, which lead to **Billings**. Revenue is then a percentage of billings, which is divided between Cardlytics and its Financial Institution (FI) partners.

**Key Business Engine Assumptions & Justification:**

1.  **MQUs Growth (Supply):** Management has prioritized "increasing supply" as a key pillar and reported a 19% year-over-year increase in MQUs to 224.5 million in Q2 2025. I assume a continued strong, but moderating, growth for the next couple of years due to new partners (neobanks, Cardlytics Rewards platform) before settling into a mature, low single-digit rate.
    *   *Assumption:* 2026: +15%, 2027: +10%, 2028: +7%, 2029: +5%, 2030: +3%.
2.  **ACPU (Demand & Optimization):** ACPU, which represents the effective monetization of users, is a direct result of "strengthening demand" and "optimizing our network" (two other key pillars). ACPU decreased from $0.16 to $0.14 year-over-year in Q2 2025. The business is shifting to engagement-based pricing (74% of advertisers as of Q1 2025), which aims to increase redemptions and scale budgets. I project ACPU to recover and grow as the new product initiatives, including Bridg integration and micro-targeting, take hold.
    *   *Assumption:* 2026: +10%, 2027: +15%, 2028: +12%, 2029: +10%, 2030: +8%.
3.  **Billings:** Billings are calculated as MQUs multiplied by ACPU.
4.  **Revenue as % of Billings (Rev/Billings):** Management guided for a Rev/Billings margin in the **low 60% range** for Q3 2025 and the full year 2025 (from step 1). This is the split of billings retained by Cardlytics. I conservatively assume this ratio remains stable over the projection period, reflecting the negotiated split with FI partners.
    *   *Assumption:* **62%** constant for 2025-2030.

| Metric | Base (Q2 2025) | 2025E (FY) | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | 2030E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MQUs (Millions)** | 224.5 | **230.0** | **264.5** | **291.0** | **311.7** | **327.3** | **337.1** |
| *YoY Growth* | +19% | +2.4% | +15.0% | +10.0% | +7.0% | +5.0% | +3.0% |
| **ACPU (USD)** | 0.14 | **0.57** | **0.63** | **0.72** | **0.81** | **0.89** | **0.96** |
| *YoY Growth (ACPU is based on Annualised run-rate for FY 2025)* | -12.5% | 407% | +10.0% | +15.0% | +12.0% | +10.0% | +8.0% |
| **Total Billings (Millions USD)** | 104.0 (Q2) | **266.6** | **386.6** | **525.9** | **680.1** | **837.7** | **984.7** |
| **Revenue / Billings %** | ~61% (Q2) | **62.0%** | **62.0%** | **62.0%** | **62.0%** | **62.0%** | **62.0%** |
| **Projected Revenue (Millions USD)** | 63.2 (Q2) | **165.3** | **239.7** | **326.1** | **421.7** | **519.3** | **610.5** |
| *Revenue YoY Growth* | -9.2% (Q2) | *N/A* | 45.0% | 36.1% | 29.3% | 23.2% | 17.6% |

**2025 Full Year (FY) Estimate:** The Q2 2025 revenue was $63.2M. The Q3 2025 guidance is $52.2M - $58.2M. This indicates a weak H2 2025 due to partner headwinds. I project a conservative full-year 2025 revenue of **$165.3 million** (extrapolating from Q2 run rate with a H2 decline and allowing for Q4 seasonality) to be consistent with the declining guidance.

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection (2025-2030)

The company is focused on a turnaround and achieving profitability.

**Key Margin Assumptions & Justification:**

1.  **Gross Margin (Adjusted Contribution Margin):** The company reported Adjusted Contribution as a non-GAAP metric, which is similar to Gross Profit (Revenue less Partner and Consumer incentives). The guidance for Q3 2025 Adjusted Contribution as a percentage of revenue is in the **mid- to high 50% range** (from step 1). I start with a conservative 55% and project a modest ramp to 65% by 2030 due to scale and "optimizing our network" efficiencies.
2.  **Net Income Margin:** The company posted a net loss of $(9.3) million in Q2 2025 but a positive Adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 million, indicating cost controls are working to offset revenue declines. I project a conservative and gradual ramp to profitability by 2028, reflecting management's focus on **"long-term profitable growth"** and recent cost-saving initiatives (workforce reductions) (from step 3). I assume a mature Net Income Margin of 12% by 2030, which is conservative for a growing software-like platform business.

| Metric | 2025E | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | 2030E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Projected Revenue (Millions USD)** | **165.3** | **239.7** | **326.1** | **421.7** | **519.3** | **610.5** |
| **Gross Margin % (Adj. Contribution)** | 55.0% | 58.0% | 60.0% | 62.0% | 64.0% | 65.0% |
| **Net Income Margin %** | -10.0% | -5.0% | 0.0% | 3.0% | 8.0% | 12.0% |
| **Net Income (Millions USD)** | **(16.5)** | **(12.0)** | **0.0** | **12.7** | **41.5** | **73.3** |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### A. Free Cash Flow Approximation

The net income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) as per the instruction.

1.  **ROIC Assumption:** Past ROIC is consistently negative (e.g., -18.62% as of Q2 2025). Since positive net income is projected, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC. A low-growth, established tech company might have an ROIC of 5-10%. I will use a **conservative ROIC of 5.0%** on the retained net income (cash from the prior year).
2.  **Net Income/Cash Flow Calculation:** Net Income (t) = Projected Net Income (t) + (Prior Year Retained Cash * ROIC).

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) (Millions USD) | Prior Year Retained Cash (B) (Millions USD) | ROIC (C) | ROIC Income (B * C) (Millions USD) | Net Income / FCF (A + (B * C)) (Millions USD) | Retained Cash for Next Year (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | (16.5) | 0.0 | 5.0% | 0.0 | **(16.5)** | 0.0 |
| **2026E** | (12.0) | 0.0 | 5.0% | 0.0 | **(12.0)** | 0.0 |
| **2027E** | 0.0 | 0.0 | 5.0% | 0.0 | **0.0** | 0.0 |
| **2028E** | 12.7 | 0.0 | 5.0% | 0.0 | **12.7** | 12.7 |
| **2029E** | 41.5 | 12.7 | 5.0% | 0.6 | **42.1** | 54.8 |
| **2030E** | 73.3 | 54.8 | 5.0% | 2.7 | **76.0** | 130.8 |

#### B. Terminal Value and Discount Rate

1.  **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** I assume a highly conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%**, reflecting long-term GDP growth, but keeping it low given the company's current stage of turnaround and high debt.
2.  **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** Given the high-risk nature of a turnaround, the company's negative ROIC, and its high debt/equity ratio (3.75), a high discount rate is necessary. The search results indicated a historical WACC of 5.46%, which is generally considered too low for a company of this risk profile. I will use a conservative and realistic **Discount Rate (WACC) of 12.0%**.

**Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
*   TV = FCF (2030) * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
*   TV = $76.0 million * (1 + 0.02) / (0.12 - 0.02)
*   TV = $77.52 million / 0.10 = **$775.2 million**

#### C. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | FCF (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.12)^n) | NPV of FCF (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | (16.5) | 0.8929 | (14.7) |
| **2026** | (12.0) | 0.7972 | (9.6) |
| **2027** | 0.0 | 0.7120 | 0.0 |
| **2028** | 12.7 | 0.6355 | 8.1 |
| **2029** | 42.1 | 0.5674 | 23.9 |
| **2030** | 76.0 | 0.5066 | 38.5 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | 775.2 | 0.5066 | 393.2 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$439.4 million** |

---

### V. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value of Equity** = Total NPV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt

*   **Total NPV:** $439.4 million
*   **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents:** $46.75 million
*   **Total Debt:** $214.30 million

**Fair Value of Equity** = $439.4 million + $46.75 million - $214.30 million = **$271.85 million**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding

*   **Shares Outstanding:** 53.24 million

**Fair Value Per Share** = $271.85 million / 53.24 million = **$5.11**

---

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **$5.11** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **$2.03** |
| **Difference** | **151.7%** |

**The Fair Value of Cardlytics (CDLX) stock is calculated to be $5.11 per share.**

The calculated Fair Value of **$5.11** is significantly higher than the current market price of **$2.03**.

**Justification for the Discrepancy (Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions):**

The market is likely making significantly more conservative assumptions than this valuation, primarily regarding the ramp to profitability.

1.  **Market Skepticism on Profitability:** The market views CDLX as a high-risk, unproven turnaround story. The company has a history of consistently negative ROIC and Net Losses and has only recently achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA ($2.7 million in Q2 2025) while still experiencing revenue decline and partner headwinds. The market is likely pricing in a higher probability of:
    *   **Failure to reach positive Net Income/FCF:** The valuation assumes positive Net Income by 2028. The market may project losses to continue for longer or indefinitely, which would dramatically lower the NPV.
    *   **Lower Growth/Monetization:** The market is likely skeptical that MQUs and ACPU can grow aggressively (45% and 36.1% revenue growth in 2026/2027) given the recent revenue decline. The market may not fully trust the success of the four-pillar strategy (Bridg integration, supply/demand optimization) and engagement-based pricing.

2.  **Debt and Liquidity Concerns:** The high debt of $214.3 million relative to the low market cap and the meager cash position of $46.75 million creates a high risk of future dilution or financial distress, which the market discounts heavily. A higher discount rate or a much lower terminal growth rate would reflect this risk.

3.  **Conservative Valuation Rationale:** This valuation is based on a **conservative assumption of management's successful execution** of their strategy, reflected in:
    *   A modest terminal growth rate of **2.0%**.
    *   A high discount rate of **12.0%**.
    *   A slow ramp to a moderate Net Income Margin (12% by 2030).

**Why the Valuation is Higher:** The model assumes the company's internal metrics (MQUs/ACPU) will accelerate in 2026/2027 and that the cost-cutting measures and focus on high-margin revenue streams will lead to a **successful turnaround and sustained profitability**. The market is waiting for *proof* of this execution before assigning a higher multiple to the shares, which is why the current price remains low. **The fair value represents the intrinsic value if the company successfully executes its stated strategy, whereas the market price reflects a high-probability of execution risk and failure.**
