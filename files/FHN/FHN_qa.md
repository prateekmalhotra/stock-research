## Business Summary

First Horizon Corporation (FHN) operates primarily as a regional bank holding company, focusing on providing traditional banking and financial services to individual consumers and small to mid-sized businesses, mainly across the Southern and Mid-Atlantic United States. The core business model relies on accepting deposits from customers (savings and checking accounts) and using that money to fund various loans, such as mortgages, commercial real estate loans, and business lines of credit. FHN's primary source of revenue is the difference between the interest it earns on these loans and the interest it pays on deposits. Beyond interest earnings, the company generates significant fee revenue by offering specialized financial services like wealth management, trust services, and brokerage advice.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk is interest rate volatility; if the Federal Reserve raises rates too quickly, the cost of funds (interest paid to depositors) can rise faster than the income earned from existing, long-term loans, squeezing FHN's profitability. This squeeze on net interest margin was a major concern for regional banks following the rapid rate hikes of 2022 and 2023. A long-term threat is credit risk, where a significant economic downturn, particularly affecting the Southern U.S. real estate or commercial sectors, could lead to widespread loan defaults. This kind of event severely harmed the banking industry during the 2008 financial crisis, forcing banks to write off large sums of bad debt. Currently, commercial real estate exposure, especially office space, remains a heightened worry. Furthermore, as a regional bank, FHN faces liquidity risk; sudden loss of customer confidence, demonstrated by the bank failures in early 2023, can cause deposits to flee quickly through digital means, forcing the company to potentially sell assets at a loss to cover immediate withdrawals.

## Company History

The history of First Horizon Corporation (FHN) is a story of a regional bank that was founded out of a necessity for economic stability and grew through diversification and strategic mergers over more than a century and a half.

### **Inception and Founding (1864)**

1.  **Original Name and Location:** The company began in 1864 in Memphis, Tennessee, under the name First National Bank of Memphis.
2.  **Why It Was Founded:** The founder, Frank S. Davis, saw a vital need for banking and credit to finance the rebuilding and new commercial growth of the city following the financial instability of the Civil War.
3.  **Initial Tailwinds:** The bank was established immediately after the passage of the National Banking Act of 1863, which allowed for the creation of nationally chartered banks, giving it a strong foundation right from the start.

### **Evolution and Expansion (1878 – 2004)**

4.  **Early Headwinds and Resilience:** The bank faced a major headwind in 1878 during the Yellow Fever epidemic; however, a bookkeeper famously kept the bank open to serve clients and distribute relief funds, showcasing a commitment to the community that helped it endure.
5.  **Becoming a Holding Company:** To enable the company to acquire other banks outside of Memphis, a holding company structure, First Tennessee National Corporation, was created in the 1970s.
6.  **Reflecting Growth (Name Change):** In 1977, the bank changed its name from First National to First Tennessee to reflect its growing ambition to expand beyond the Memphis city limits into the wider state of Tennessee.
7.  **The Goal of Diversification:** By the late 1990s, to show that the company offered a comprehensive range of financial services beyond just basic banking, it adopted the slogan "All Things Financial."
8.  **Reflecting Interstate Growth:** The parent company changed its name in 2004 to First Horizon National Corporation to signify its strategic shift and growth into a multi-state organization.

### **Navigating Modern Challenges and Solutions (2007 – Present)**

9.  **Post-2008 Crisis Headwind (Streamlining):** Following the financial crisis of 2008, the company simplified its structure by selling non-core businesses, such as its residential-mortgage origination and servicing operations, to focus on its core regional banking and fixed-income strengths.
10. **Innovative Solution in IT:** As customer demand for digital channels grew, the bank's IT systems became complex. The innovative solution was to implement automated software asset management to track software licenses, simplify processes, and reduce compliance risks.
11. **Strategic Growth via Mergers (Solution for Scale):** A major solution to increase size and market presence was a series of significant mergers, most notably the acquisition of Capital Bank in 2017 and the merger with IberiaBank Corporation in 2020.
12. **Gaining Scale and New Identity:** The 2020 merger created one of the largest financial services companies headquartered in the South, which led the parent company to formally change its name to the streamlined "First Horizon Corporation."
13. **Dealing with Market Headwinds:** In the face of a challenging interest rate environment, a successful internal solution was to lean on its "countercyclical businesses," such as fixed-income trading, which provided a profitable buffer against declining rates in other areas.
14. **The 2023 Crisis and a Merger Headwind:** A significant recent headwind occurred in 2023 when a planned merger with Toronto-Dominion Bank was called off, leading to a temporary drop in the stock price during a period of wider regional banking instability.
15. **Current Solution to Stability:** To handle the stress of this recent period, the company has emphasized its **prudent balance sheet management** and **exceptionally strong capital levels**, which allowed it to continue growing loans and deposits faster than many of its competitors.

### **Current Status and Core Goal**

16. **Current Status:** First Horizon Corporation is a leading regional financial services company with a significant presence across the Southeastern United States.
17. **The Ultimate Goal (Core Purpose):** The company’s goal is driven by a core purpose: to provide financial solutions with exceptional service and build lasting relationships with its clients and communities, helping them "unlock their full potential with capital and counsel."
18. **The Vision:** Their vision is to become the premier regional financial services company in the Southeast, demonstrating a commitment to regional excellence rather than simply pursuing a national scope.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of First Horizon Corporation (FHN) is built primarily on a combination of strong local market penetration, high customer switching costs from deep relationships, and a diversified business model that includes specialized, resilient lending services.

### Analysis of First Horizon Corporation's Moat

#### **1. Differentiation from Competitors (The "Big Bank/Community Bank" Hybrid)**

*   **Unique Position:** First Horizon's main competitive difference is its operating model, which combines the comprehensive products and capabilities of a large, "big bank" with the personalized service, relationship-focus, and local decision-making of a smaller, "community bank".
*   **Geographic Focus:** The company concentrates its operations across the thriving Southeastern United States, a region that benefits from favorable demographic and economic growth trends, which provides a geographic advantage over competitors.

#### **2. Special Positioning and Products**

*   **Specialty Banking:** FHN has a key strategic segment called Specialty Banking, which includes high-value, less-common services like fixed-income/capital markets, mortgage warehouse lending, and various corporate finance offerings (e.g., energy finance, equipment finance). This diverse mix of fee-based services and specialized lending provides revenue stability and higher margins, which is a major differentiator from pure-play regional banks.
*   **Risk Management Advantage:** The company's loan portfolio mix, which includes lower-risk loans like those to mortgage companies and limits exposure to higher-loss products like credit cards, resulted in a stressed loss rate significantly lower than the peer median in a company-run stress test. This superior risk management is a clear, tangible competitive edge.

#### **3. Pricing Power**

*   **Limited Deposit Pricing Power:** As with most banks, FHN faces intense competition for deposits, which puts upward pressure on funding costs, indicating limited pricing power in the basic deposit market.
*   **Pricing Power in Niche Segments:** The diversified Specialty Banking and Wealth Management segments, however, offer specialized products and advice (e.g., Treasury products, wealth management, capital markets) where expertise and established relationships allow for greater fee-based revenue and potentially higher margins, giving the company relative pricing power in those specific niche areas.

#### **4. Historical Growth and Rationale (The Reason it Grew)**

*   **Deep Local Roots and Stability:** The company was founded in 1864 in Memphis, Tennessee, and its long operating history and community focus have been fundamental to building trust and loyalty over generations. This history of stability and long-term presence is the bedrock of its current market position.
*   **Strategic Transformation:** FHN's growth and stability are a result of a past strategic shift to de-risk its balance sheet and focus on organic growth, backed by significant infrastructure upgrades. This transition allowed the company to grow its market share in the attractive Southeast region.

#### **5. Customer Stickiness and Contracts (Switching Costs)**

*   **Sticky and Recurring Customer Base:** FHN's customer relationships are highly sticky and recurring, as evidenced by a client retention rate of over 90% in a recent year, with the retained client base averaging over nine years of tenure. Switching banks, especially for businesses with integrated services like Treasury management, involves significant time and operational costs, creating a substantial switching barrier.
*   **Relationship-Driven Model:** The company’s core strategy is a "customer-centric approach" focused on building deep, long-term relationships through personalized service and tailored solutions, which inherently makes the contracts sticky and recurring.

#### **6. Ease of Displacement by Competitors**

*   **Difficult to Displace:** A new competitor with more capital would find it difficult to displace FHN due to the long-tenured customer relationships and the company's strong, specialized service mix. It takes decades to build the deep trust and local institutional knowledge that FHN possesses in its markets.
*   **Capital is Not Enough:** While a large bank can easily deploy capital, FHN's resilient capital position and strong risk management, as shown by its stress test results, make it a robust and formidable competitor that cannot be simply overwhelmed by a new entrant's capital alone.

#### **7. Strategies for Moat Building (Past and Present)**

*   **Investment in Technology:** To maintain its competitive edge, the company is making significant investments in technology upgrades (e.g., a $100 million allocation over three years) to improve its digital banking, customer experience, and operational efficiency.
*   **Cross-Selling and Relationship Management:** The current strategy includes a focus on maximizing existing relationships by cross-selling products like Treasury management and upgrading technology to better manage and connect with clients (the FH360 program).
*   **Community and Local Presence:** By having leadership *in* the marketplace and emphasizing community engagement, the company continuously strengthens the local bond, which acts as a powerful barrier to entry.

#### **8. Network Effects and Innovation**

*   **Local Network Advantage:** While not a traditional software network effect, FHN benefits from a *local network advantage* where a high concentration of long-term customers and strong community ties create convenience and trust, making it the default choice for local businesses and individuals.
*   **Innovation Focus:** The company does not invest heavily in traditional R&D but must **constantly innovate** in its *service delivery and technology* to stay competitive, particularly by enhancing its digital platforms and improving internal processes. This ongoing investment in technology and efficiency is critical for maintaining its edge over larger banks and nimble fintechs.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on recent news, articles, and the Q4 2024, Q1 2025, and Q2 2025 earnings calls, here are the catalysts that may increase First Horizon Corporation's (FHN) stock price.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (0-12 Months)**

1.  **Execution of Cost and Revenue Initiatives:** The bank has identified an opportunity to add $\text{\$100}$ million or more in Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) by improving business execution and deepening client relationships. Management is focused on disciplined expense control, and they recently lowered full-year 2025 expense guidance to flat to up 2% (as of the Q2 2025 call).
2.  **Strategic Capital Deployment and Share Buybacks:** FHN has maintained a strong Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio and has used its excess capital for share repurchases, buying back $\text{\$360}$ million of stock in Q1 2025 alone. Continuing this program is a direct way to increase Earnings Per Share (EPS).
3.  **Favorable Interest Rate Environment (Deposit Costs):** As the Federal Reserve moves to cut rates, FHN has shown strong deposit pricing discipline, successfully lowering its interest-bearing deposit costs. In a declining rate cycle, this deposit cost management and strong customer retention (retaining 95% of repriced deposits in Q1 2025) helps maintain the Net Interest Margin (NIM).
4.  **Strength in Specialty Businesses:** Continued strong performance and growth in specialized lending, particularly the mortgage warehouse business, is a key driver of net interest income and overall financial performance.
5.  **Market-Driven Takeover Speculation:** Following the termination of the TD Bank deal, FHN is still viewed by some analysts as an attractive acquisition target, which can keep a "takeover premium" incorporated into the stock price.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)**

1.  **Achieving Target Profitability:** Management's stated intermediate-term goal is to achieve a Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) of **15% or higher**. Successfully reaching this financial benchmark would signal highly profitable and efficient operations, a significant long-term catalyst.
2.  **Leveraging a Favorable Geographic Footprint:** FHN's operations are concentrated across 12 states in the Southeast U.S., a region benefiting from favorable population migration and economic growth, which supports faster overall loan and deposit growth.
3.  **Organic Loan and Deposit Growth:** The company's strategy is focused on driving organic growth by strengthening existing client relationships and attracting new clients in its key markets, which builds a strong, long-lasting deposit and loan base.
4.  **Maintaining Strong Credit Quality:** Consistent strong credit performance, with low net charge-offs (0.22% in Q2 2025), demonstrates prudent lending and risk management. This focus on "safety and soundness" helps preserve capital for future growth.

### **Management's Explicit Strategy and Catalysts (from Recent Earnings Calls)**

*   **Strategy Focus:** CEO Bryan Jordan stated in the Q1 2025 call that their business model prioritizes **safety and soundness, profitability, and growth**, equipping the company to manage uncertainties and deliver sustainable growth.
*   **Core Growth Driver:** The management team's strategy focuses on **organic growth** by strengthening and deepening client relationships across its diversified business lines.
*   **Financial Goal:** Management has consistently targeted a **\$100 million PPNR uplift** by improving business execution and enhancing client relationship management.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** Management is working toward an **intermediate-term ROTCE of 15% or greater** through strategic capital management and leveraging its attractive geographic footprint and diversified business model.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of First Horizon Corporation's (FHN) recent proxy materials, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (FHN)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership (Alignment with Shareholders)**

1.  **Low Direct Ownership:** Insider ownership by managers and directors is relatively low, typically reported to be around **1.0%** of the company's total shares outstanding.
2.  **Weak Direct Alignment Signal:** This low percentage indicates that the executives and directors do not personally hold a substantial portion of the company's equity, which is generally a weaker signal for direct, personal alignment with all shareholders' interests (where "higher the better").
3.  **Institutional Influence:** The shareholder base is heavily dominated by **institutional owners, who hold approximately 81% to 82%** of the stock, suggesting management is more likely to be influenced by the demands and preferences of large institutional investors.

#### **2. Compensation Structure**

1.  **High "At-Risk" Pay Mix:** FHN's executive compensation is heavily weighted toward performance-based and equity-based compensation to align interests with shareholders and reward long-term success.
2.  **CEO Compensation Breakdown:** A significant majority of the CEO’s total direct compensation for 2024 was considered **"at-risk" (86%)**, meaning it is contingent on financial or market performance.
3.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus:** The long-term incentive awards, particularly Performance Share Units (PSUs), represent the largest component of pay, with the CEO's target long-term award set to be **450% of base salary**.

#### **3. Performance and Incentive Metrics**

1.  **Relative Peer Performance:** A key metric for the long-term PSUs is **adjusted Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE)**, which is measured relative to a peer group of banks (the KBW regional bank index).
2.  **Direct Shareholder Return Link:** The resulting ROTCE performance outcome is further **adjusted by FHN's Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** performance, also relative to the same peer group, directly linking a significant portion of LTI pay to stock market performance over a five-year period.
3.  **Holistic Value Creation:** The company explicitly links its value creation to the three principles of **safety and soundness, profitability, and growth**, which is a sound framework for a financial institution.

#### **Conclusion: Shareholder Alignment vs. Self-Interest**

1.  **Strong Incentive Alignment:** Despite the low absolute insider ownership percentage, the **structure** of the compensation plan strongly incentivizes management to act in the shareholders' interest through its heavy reliance on **long-term equity awards** tied to **relative ROTCE and TSR** performance.
2.  **Focus on Long-Term Value:** The use of **five-year performance periods** and metrics focused on both profitability (ROTCE) and stock performance (TSR) encourages long-term strategic decisions that should theoretically create sustainable shareholder value, rather than short-term gains.
3.  **Mitigation of Self-Interest:** The structure counteracts the weak signal from low direct ownership by making the majority of executive wealth contingent on outperforming competitors over a multi-year horizon, suggesting management is primarily incentivized to act in the interests of those owning FHN's stock.

## Price History

Here is an analysis of the price history and technical outlook for First Horizon Corporation (FHN).

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low**
    *   The stock is currently trading approximately **54.08%** above its 52-week low of $\$14.83$.
    *   Based on a recent price of approximately $\$22.85$, the stock is very close to its 52-week high of $\$23.26$.

2.  **Technical Analysis and Trading Level**

    *   Some technical analysis signals, based on moving averages and other indicators, have indicated a "Strong Buy" signal, though other analysis suggests a potential bearish retest.
    *   The average analyst rating is a "Buy" with a consensus price target slightly above the current price, suggesting a positive long-term outlook.

3.  **Recent Price Performance**
    *   First Horizon Corporation's stock has been **up bigly**, rallying approximately **36% to 48%** over the last year, significantly outperforming the broader regional bank industry.
    *   The stock has also seen a recent surge, with shares rising over 20% in the second half of the previous year.

4.  **Explanation for Major Gains**
    *   The upward movement is largely attributed to **stronger-than-expected financial performance**, including a beat on earnings per share (EPS) in a recent quarter.
    *   The stock has benefited from a **broad re-rating among regional banks**, coupled with the company's solid growth in both loans and deposits.
    *   A significant boost came from the bank's efforts to restart its business following the termination of the proposed acquisition by The Toronto-Dominion Bank.

## Long Thesis

First Horizon Corporation is positioned to become the premier high-profit bank in the booming Southeastern U.S. Its strategy combines personalized local banking service with a highly stable, diversified revenue stream derived from specialized, high-margin lending and fee-based businesses. Management is aggressively focused on cutting costs, deploying excess capital via major share buybacks, and aiming for a high return on equity (15%+). As the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the bank's ability to lower the cost it pays depositors faster than the competition will substantially expand its profit margins, leading to rapid earnings growth and a higher stock valuation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case relies on four key outcomes: 1) The favorable economic growth and migration trends in the Southeast must persist. 2) Management must successfully execute its plan to achieve a 15% return on equity and $100 million in profit improvement through efficiency. 3) The bank must maintain its exceptionally strong credit quality and avoid major losses, particularly in its commercial real estate portfolio. 4) The Federal Reserve must eventually cut interest rates, allowing the bank to lower its funding costs faster than the competition.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for First Horizon Corporation (FHN) presents an optimistic future built on strong execution and favorable macroeconomic shifts. However, current financial and competitive realities introduce significant holes and flaws into its core assumptions.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Challenged Deposit Cost Advantage in a Rate-Cut Cycle (Flaw in Assumption 4):** The thesis relies on FHN lowering deposit costs "faster than the competition," but recent performance shows intensifying deposit pricing pressure. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits has recently risen sequentially, and a notable portion of deposit growth has come from high-cost brokered Certificates of Deposit (CDs), which directly contradicts the narrative of easily reducing funding costs.

2.  **Execution Risk on the 15%+ Profitability Target (Flaw in Assumption 2):** While management maintains the long-term goal of a 15%+ Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE), the current return on equity (ROE) is significantly lower, suggesting a considerable gap that must be closed through flawless execution of the $100 million profit improvement plan.

3.  **Rising Regulatory Headwinds and Counteracting Cost Cuts (Flaw in Assumption 2):** The focus on aggressive cost-cutting is directly undermined by impending regulatory expenses. As FHN approaches the $100 billion asset threshold, it anticipates additional compliance costs of $25 million to $50 million, which will immediately erode a substantial portion of the targeted $100 million in efficiency and profit improvement.

4.  **Heightened Competitive Pressure in the "Booming Southeast" (Flaw in Assumption 1):** The "premier bank" thesis assumes a competitive advantage from its Southeast footprint, but analysts note that other banks have also recognized the favorable demographics, leading to increased competition for deposits and loans, which limits FHN's ability to achieve "premier" margins.

5.  **Overstated Capital Deployment via Share Buybacks (Flaw in Thesis Statement):** The thesis suggests "major share buybacks." Although a $1 billion repurchase program has been authorized, management has stated that buybacks are "paced behind loan growth priorities," and one analyst anticipates only modest repurchases due to the need to manage capital, in part, against a $1 billion of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income - AOCI).

6.  **Specific Credit Quality Pressure in Key Portfolio (Flaw in Assumption 3):** Despite overall solid credit quality, the bank has specifically noted increasing pressure within its multifamily Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio, which accounts for approximately 28% of its total CRE exposure, a segment facing oversupply and weak rent trends in the Southern markets.

7.  **Valuation Incorporates Non-Operating Premium:** The stock has seen strong gains, but its current valuation (Price-to-Earnings ratio) is trading at a premium to its regional bank peers and its own historical average, which some analysts believe reflects a "takeover premium" following the terminated TD Bank deal. This suggests the "upside" of the bull case is already partially priced in based on an external, non-fundamental, and unpredictable event.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for First Horizon Corporation (FHN)

The bull case’s reliance on a flawless execution of a high-margin strategy will be undermined by stiff regional competition, rising regulatory burdens, and an overly optimistic outlook on funding costs.

1.  **Margin Compression from Competitive Funding Costs:** First Horizon will struggle to achieve the anticipated rapid earnings expansion because competitive pressures in the Southeast for deposits will prevent its funding costs from falling as quickly as its assets reprice in a rate-cutting environment. This "stickier" deposit beta will compress the Net Interest Margin (NIM) and negate the primary catalyst for rapid earnings growth.

2.  **Strategic Failure to Achieve Profit Targets Due to Rising Costs:** The ambitious 15%+ ROTCE and $100 million in efficiency improvements face a high execution risk that is directly counteracted by mandatory regulatory spending (estimated at \$25M-\$50M) as the bank grows. This will cause core efficiency ratios to deteriorate, making the stated profit targets unachievable within the projected timeline and lowering investor confidence in management's long-term plan.

3.  **Underappreciated Credit Risk in the Southeastern CRE Market:** While overall credit quality is strong, the specific concentration and noted pressure in the multifamily CRE segment in the South exposes the loan book to a rising risk from oversupply and cooling rent growth, which could necessitate higher loan-loss provisions, thereby reducing net income and capital available for buybacks.

4.  **Capital Return Disappointment:** The anticipated "major share buybacks" will be curtailed as the company prioritizes loan growth and capital retention to manage both the AOCI-related unrealized losses and preparations for the $100 billion asset-size regulatory hurdle. This modest pace of capital return will disappoint investors who are banking on significant EPS accretion from buybacks.

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive work you have done, the investigation has clearly defined the key points of debate between the bullish and bearish perspectives. The next steps should focus on quantifying these debates and verifying management's execution claims with the latest available data.

Here are the important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should investigate:

### **1. Quantify the Gap to Management's Profitability Targets**

*   **Current Status vs. Goal:** Confirm the current adjusted Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE), which was **13.6%** in Q2 2025, against the intermediate-term target of **15%+** (by 2027) to fully quantify the required performance jump.
*   **The Regulatory Headwind:** Verify the current net Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) of **\$339 million** in Q2 2025. You must then compare management's target of an extra **\$100 million** in PPNR over the next 2-3 years to the projected **\$25 million to \$50 million** in regulatory compliance costs from crossing the \$100 billion asset mark.
*   **Actionable Plan Details:** Investigate the specific breakdown of the **\$100 million PPNR uplift** plan to determine how much relies on *revenue initiatives* (e.g., cross-selling Treasury products) versus *expense management*, as execution risk is a central flaw in the bear case.

### **2. Verify Credit Quality Risk in the Multifamily CRE Portfolio**

*   **Specific Segment Data:** Your bear case highlights pressure in the multifamily Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio. While Q2 2025 non-performing loans (NPLs) and overall CRE balances declined, the next step is to find the *specific* Non-Accrual Loan or Non-Performing Asset ratio (NPA) for the **multifamily segment** to verify the degree of "increasing pressure."
*   **Forward-Looking Guidance:** Search for management’s forward guidance or analyst commentary on the anticipated **net charge-off (NCO) rate specifically for CRE** loans over the next 12 months, as overall NCOs remain low at 22 basis points.

### **3. Test the "Sticky Deposit Cost" and NIM Compression Thesis**

*   **Backward vs. Forward Deposit Beta:** The bear case claims deposit costs will be "sticky" in a rate-cut cycle. FHN's reported cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was **72%** since rate cuts began, which may be high or low depending on the peer group. Find comparable *downward deposit betas* for a peer group like **KEY, CMA, or HBAN** to see if FHN truly has a competitive advantage in lowering funding costs.
*   **Mix Shift Trend:** Further investigate the Q2 2025 deposit growth, which was driven by a **\$1.6 billion increase in brokered CDs**. This is the *highest-cost* funding source and contradicts the bull thesis. Determine what portion of total deposits is currently comprised of these high-cost brokered funds and what management's specific target is to *reverse* this mix shift.

### **4. Analyze the Insider and Institutional Confidence Signals**

*   **Quantify the Takeover Premium:** Analysts already estimate the stock trades at an **11% premium** to peers and above its 7-year median P/E, which is attributed to a "takeover premium." Calculate the implied value of this premium in dollars per share to understand how much the stock is at risk if no acquisition materializes.
*   **Recent Insider Trading:** Despite the very low insider ownership (1.0%), check **recent Form 4 filings (in 2024 and 2025)** to see if the small group of insiders has been net buyers or net sellers of shares, which could signal confidence or doubt in the post-TD Bank strategic pivot.
