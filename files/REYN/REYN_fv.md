## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Reynolds Consumer Products' business engine is driven by its strong branded portfolio (Reynolds Wrap, Hefty) in the stable, slow-growth consumer staples market, complemented by a store-brand segment (Presto). The core drivers are: **(1) Pricing/Price-Pack Architecture** to offset commodity inflation and reduce elasticity; **(2) Manufacturing/Operational Efficiency (Productivity)** via automation investments to expand margins; and **(3) Innovation** (new scents, eco-friendly products) to gain market share.

The management's strategy for 2026 is focused on executing productivity and innovation initiatives to drive earnings growth, even with a flat to slightly negative top-line outlook.

### Revenue Projection Justification

| Year | Assumed Growth Rate | Projected Net Revenue | Justification/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | N/A | $3,721 | Full-year 2025 Net Revenue. |
| **2026 (Management Guide)** | 0.0% (Midpoint of -3% to +1%) | $3,721 | Using the conservative midpoint of management's guidance range. Reflects category headwinds (foam/foil) but expects to match or beat category performance. |
| **2027** | 1.0% | $3,758 | Conservative growth assumption. Reflects the expected positive impact of 2026's increased investment in automation, innovation, and productivity starting to materialize in volume and mix, partially offset by commodity volatility. |
| **2028** | 1.5% | $3,814 | Assumes a slight acceleration as the multi-year productivity and automation investments are fully operational, yielding modest, stable growth typical of a mature consumer staples company. |
| **2029** | 1.5% | $3,871 | Continuation of stable, low-single-digit growth, driven by pricing power in branded segments and supply chain efficiency. |
| **2030** | 1.5% | $3,929 | Assumes the business engine has stabilized to a long-term, conservative growth rate. |

## 3. Margin Assumptions and Net Income Calculation

### Margin Justification

The Net Income Margin will be calculated to justify the Net Income Projections.

*   **FY 2025 Net Income Margin:** $301M (Net Income) / $3,721M (Revenue) = **8.09%**.
*   **FY 2026 Net Income Margin (Midpoint Guide):** $337M (Midpoint of $331M-$343M Net Income Guide) / $3,721M (Revenue) = **9.06%**.

The expected increase in Net Income Margin for 2026 (from 8.09% to 9.06%) is explicitly supported by management's focus on cost reduction, manufacturing efficiencies, and SG&A optimization.

### Net Income Projection Assumptions

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin (2027-2030)** | 9.25% | A conservative and marginal expansion over the 2026 guidance midpoint of 9.06%. This accounts for the sustained benefit of ongoing automation projects and cost savings programs, partially countered by continuous investment in innovation and potential commodity inflation. |
| **ROIC (for re-invested earnings)** | 8.5% | Based on conservative view of historical and TTM ROIC figures (TTM ROIC was 9.40%, 3-year average was 8.91% - using a slightly lower and more conservative figure). |

### Projected Net Income (NI) with ROIC Mechanism

The calculation follows the rule: $NI_{year} = (Projected Revenue_{year} \times NI\ Margin) + (Net\ Income_{year-1} \times ROIC)$

| Year | Net Revenue | NI Margin % | NI from Operations (A) | NI from Prior Year ROIC (B) | Total Net Income (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | $3,721 | 8.09% | $301.0 | N/A | **$301.0** |
| **2026 (Guide)** | $3,721 | 9.06% | $337.0 | ($301.0 \times 8.5\%$) = $25.6$ | **$362.6** |
| **2027 (Est)** | $3,758 | 9.25% | $347.1$ | ($362.6 \times 8.5\%$) = $30.8$ | **$377.9** |
| **2028 (Est)** | $3,814 | 9.25% | $352.3$ | ($377.9 \times 8.5\%$) = $32.1$ | **$384.4** |
| **2029 (Est)** | $3,871 | 9.25% | $357.5$ | ($384.4 \times 8.5\%$) = $32.7$ | **$390.2** |
| **2030 (Est)** | $3,929 | 9.25% | $362.8$ | ($390.2 \times 8.5\%$) = $33.2$ | **$396.0** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Assumption | Justification/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | 8.0% | Conservative yet reasonable for a mature, stable consumer staples company. This is slightly higher than the cited WACC of 7.38% (as of Jan 2026), to be conservative. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | 2.0% | Very conservative. Reflects the long-term, slow growth of the U.S. consumer staples market and is only a modest fraction above long-term inflation targets. |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The net income is assumed to be the cash flow available for all stakeholders (Unlevered Free Cash Flow surrogate).

$$NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{CF_{n}(1+g)}{{(r-g)(1+r)^n}}$$

Where:
*   $CF_t$ = Total Net Income for year $t$
*   $r$ = Discount Rate (8.0%)
*   $g$ = Maturity Rate (2.0%)
*   $n$ = Last projection year (2030, or $t=5$ for projection period)

| Year ($t$) | Total Net Income (CF_t) | Discount Factor $\frac{1}{(1.08)^t}$ | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** (t=1) | $362.6 | 0.9259 | $335.7 |
| **2027** (t=2) | $377.9 | 0.8573 | $324.0 |
| **2028** (t=3) | $384.4 | 0.7938 | $305.1 |
| **2029** (t=4) | $390.2 | 0.7350 | $286.9 |
| **2030** (t=5) | $396.0 | 0.6806 | $269.5 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2026-2030)** | | | **$1,521.2** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value in 2030:
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{CF_{2030}(1+g)}{(r-g)} = \frac{\$396.0 \times (1+0.02)}{(0.08 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$403.92}{0.06} = \$6,732.0$$

Present Value of Terminal Value:
$$PV(TV) = \frac{TV_{2030}}{(1+r)^5} = \frac{\$6,732.0}{(1.08)^5} = \frac{\$6,732.0}{1.4693} = \mathbf{\$4,581.8}$$

### Total Equity Value (Enterprise Value)

$$Total\ Equity\ Value = NPV\ of\ Explicit\ Period + PV\ of\ Terminal\ Value$$
$$Total\ Equity\ Value = \$1,521.2\ (NPV\ of\ Explicit) + \$4,581.8\ (PV\ of\ TV) = \mathbf{\$6,103.0}$$

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (from DCF)** | $6,103.0 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $(1,580.0)$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $147.0$ |
| **Fair Value of Common Equity** | $\mathbf{\$4,670.0}$ |
| **Shares Outstanding (millions)** | $210.3$ |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\$4,670.0 / 210.3 = \mathbf{\$22.21}$ |

## **Fair Value of Stock: $22.21 per share**

## 6. Comparison and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value (Calculated)** | **$22.21** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$23.28** |
| **Difference** | **$(1.07)** |
| **Percentage Difference** | **-4.6%** |

### Justification and Market Assumption Analysis

The calculated Fair Value of **\$22.21** is very close to the assumed current market price of **\$23.28**, representing a small overvaluation of about 4.6% based on the model's assumptions.

**Market Assumptions vs. Model Assumptions:**

The market is making slightly more optimistic assumptions than my conservative model, but the difference is minimal. The market appears to be pricing in one or more of the following:

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth:** The market likely uses a slightly higher long-term growth rate ($g$) than my conservative 2.0%. A Terminal Value based on a **2.3%** growth rate would bring the fair value in line with the current price:
    *   $TV_{2030} = \frac{\$396.0 \times (1+0.023)}{(0.08 - 0.023)} = \$7,117.2$
    *   $PV(TV) = \$7,117.2 / 1.4693 = \$4,844.0$
    *   *New Fair Value per Share (at 2.3% g):* $(\$1,521.2 + \$4,844.0 - \$1,580 + \$147) / 210.3 = \mathbf{\$23.41}$.

2.  **Higher ROIC:** The market might assume a slightly higher long-term ROIC on re-invested earnings than my conservative 8.5%. My model's projected **9.25%** Net Income Margin for 2027-2030 is already relatively conservative given the management's commentary on productivity and cost savings initiatives, and the expected 9.06% in 2026. A slightly higher margin could easily justify the current price.

3.  **Lower Cost of Capital:** The market may be using a slightly lower Discount Rate (WACC) than my conservative 8.0%. For a stable, low-beta consumer staples company with a target Net Debt Leverage of 2.0x to 2.5x (and actual 2.1x), a WACC slightly below 8.0% is entirely reasonable. The cited analyst WACC of 7.38% supports this, and using that lower WACC would result in a higher valuation.

**Conclusion on Divergence:**

The minimal divergence of **-4.6%** is easily explained by slightly more optimistic, yet still reasonable, assumptions from the market on the company's long-term growth rate ($g$) or its cost of capital ($r$). My valuation is therefore extremely close to the current market price and confirms the company is trading within a tight range of its fair value based on conservative, management-guided fundamentals. The market is giving management credit for its execution on cost savings and margin expansion, anticipating that the Net Income Margin will continue to expand modestly and sustainably after the 2026 transition year.
