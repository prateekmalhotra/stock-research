### **Step 2: Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Forecast (2025-2030)**

#### **Business Engine Drivers:**

Reynolds Consumer Products (REYN) is a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company specializing in essential household products (Reynolds Wrap, Hefty bags, etc.). The business engine is driven by:
1.  **Volume/Share Gains:** Achieved through product innovation (e.g., Hefty Fabuloso, EcoSave) and new business wins.
2.  **Strategic Pricing:** Utilizing "Price Pack Architecture" (PPA) to pass through material/commodity costs and drive margin.
3.  **Cost Management:** Aggressive focus on operational and SG&A cost reductions and productivity improvements.

The primary headwinds are:
*   **Secular Decline in Foam Plates:** The small but cash-generative foam plate business (less than 10% of revenue) faces sustained legislative and consumer preference challenges.
*   **Commodity Volatility:** Volatility in raw materials (aluminum, resin) requires constant price adjustments.

#### **Revenue Assumptions:**

The forecast is conservative, reflecting the current low single-digit decline guidance for 2025 and an expectation of slight recovery driven by innovation and cost control offset by the foam plate headwind.

| Year | Revenue Rationale & Assumptions | Revenue Growth | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **Management Guidance:** Net revenues expected to be **down low single digits** vs. 2024's $3.695B. We assume a conservative **-2.0% decline** to the low end of guidance. | -2.0% | $3,621 |
| **2026** | **Conservative Recovery:** Transition year. Decline moderates as cost/productivity initiatives and non-foam innovation start to offset foam headwind and initial volume challenges. Assumed 0.0% growth (flat). | 0.0% | $3,621 |
| **2027** | **Modest Growth:** Business model stability confirmed. Growth driven by modest volume/share gains from new products and successful PPA implementation. Assumed **+1.0% growth**. | +1.0% | $3,657 |
| **2028** | **Sustained Low-Single-Digit Growth:** Reflects CPG company growth, factoring in low inflation-level pricing and volume driven by innovation pipeline (consistent with the "2030 strategic vision"). Assumed **+1.5% growth**. | +1.5% | $3,712 |
| **2029** | **Sustained Low-Single-Digit Growth:** Continued modest volume and price realization. Assumed **+1.5% growth**. | +1.5% | $3,767 |
| **2030** | **Sustained Low-Single-Digit Growth:** Assumed **+1.5% growth**. | +1.5% | $3,823 |

### **Step 3: Margin & Net Income Forecast (2025-2030)**

#### **Margin Assumptions & Rationale:**

*   **Net Income Margin (2024 Base):** Calculated as 2024 Adjusted Net Income ($312M) / 2024 Net Revenue ($3,695M) = **8.44%**.
*   **2025 Net Income Margin:** Management guided Adjusted EBITDA of $650M - $670M (midpoint $660M). This implies margin expansion through cost/productivity initiatives, despite lower sales. The 2025 Adjusted Net Income is projected to be in line with the midpoint of the Adjusted EPS guidance of $1.54 to $1.61, which is $1.575 EPS * 210.33M shares = $331M. This is an implied Net Income Margin of $331M / $3,621M = **9.14%**. The valuation will use this management-implied profitability metric.
*   **2026-2030 Net Income Margin:** Due to the focus on operational cost reductions, margin expansion, and a shift away from high-volatility, low-margin business, the Net Income margin is assumed to **gradually increase by 10 basis points per year** (e.g., from 9.14% to 9.24%, etc.), reflecting a conservative realization of the "margin expansion" strategic priority.

#### **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**

*   **Historical ROIC:** The initial search provided a historical ROIC of **8.53%** (LTM).
*   **Valuation ROIC:** Since the historical ROIC is positive and aligns with management's goal of "high-return work streams," an **8.0%** ROIC will be used for the valuation, which is slightly below the historical figure, making it a conservative but reasonable assumption.

#### **Net Income Projection:**

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) (USD Millions) | Projected Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A \* B) (USD Millions) | ROIC on Prior Year Cash (C) (USD Millions) | Total Net Income (Base + ROIC) (USD Millions) | Cumulative Cash (D) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,695 | 8.44% | $312 | - | $312 | $312 |
| **2025** | $3,621 | 9.14% | $331 | $312 \* 8.0% = $25 | $356 | $668 |
| **2026** | $3,621 | 9.24% | $334 | $668 \* 8.0% = $53 | $387 | $1,055 |
| **2027** | $3,657 | 9.34% | $341 | $1,055 \* 8.0% = $84 | $425 | $1,480 |
| **2028** | $3,712 | 9.44% | $350 | $1,480 \* 8.0% = $118 | $468 | $1,948 |
| **2029** | $3,767 | 9.54% | $360 | $1,948 \* 8.0% = $156 | $516 | $2,464 |
| **2030** | $3,823 | 9.64% | $368 | $2,464 \* 8.0% = $197 | $565 | $3,029 |

*(Note: Cumulative Cash (D) is the projected Net Income from all prior years, assuming it flows straight to cash as per instructions. For 2025, it is $312M + $356M = $668M. This cash is used for the subsequent year's ROIC calculation.)*

### **Step 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

#### **Discount Rate (WACC) Assumption:**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** A conservative discount rate should be used to reflect the stable but low-growth nature of the CPG sector, the leverage on the balance sheet, and the inherent risks of commodity volatility.
*   **Assumption:** **9.0%** (This is a reasonable WACC for a stable, mature consumer staple company with moderate debt, factoring in a higher equity risk premium due to the CPG market's current inflationary and recessionary pressures).

#### **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate) Assumption:**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate:** This represents the long-term, stable growth rate after the forecast period (2030). Given the secular headwinds in part of the business and the maturity of the industry, a very conservative rate is justified.
*   **Assumption:** **1.5%** (This is a conservative rate, close to the long-term inflation rate and at the low end of US GDP growth, reflecting a stable CPG company).

#### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

The Net Income from 2030 will be used for the Terminal Value calculation, as it represents the cash flow of the final year.

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $356 | 0.9174 | $326.5 |
| **2026** | $387 | 0.8417 | $325.8 |
| **2027** | $425 | 0.7722 | $328.2 |
| **2028** | $468 | 0.7084 | $331.6 |
| **2029** | $516 | 0.6499 | $335.3 |
| **2030 (Operating CF)** | $565 | 0.5963 | $336.9 |

| Calculation | Formula | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | 2030 CF \* (1 + Maturity Rate) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate) | $565 \* (1 + 0.015) / (0.090 - 0.015) = $7,639 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | TV \* Discount Factor for 2030 | $7,639 \* 0.5963 | $4,554.2 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | Sum of all NPVs (2025-2030) + NPV of TV | $326.5 + $325.8 + $328.2 + $331.6 + $335.3 + $336.9 + $4,554.2 | **$6,538.5** |

### **Step 5: Fair Value Calculation**

The total fair value of the equity is calculated by starting with the Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value Proxy), adding current Cash & Cash Equivalents, and subtracting Total Debt.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $6,538.5 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $96.0 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | ($1,735.0) |
| **Total Fair Value of Equity** | **$4,899.5** |

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | $4,899.5 million |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 210.33 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $4,899.5M / 210.33M | **$23.29** |

## **Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: $23.29**

### **Justification for Assumptions**

1.  **Revenue Forecast:** The forecast is conservative, starting with a 2% decline in 2025 based on management's "low single-digit decline" guidance. The subsequent 1.0%-1.5% growth rate is modest for a CPG company, fully accounting for the secular headwind in the foam business and commodity volatility. This assumes management's investments in innovation and cost-cutting will only partially materialize as modest long-term volume gains.
2.  **Margin Forecast:** The initial Net Income margin for 2025 (9.14%) is directly derived from the midpoint of the management's adjusted EPS guidance for 2025, adhering to the rule to "Use whatever management has said as truth." The 10 basis point annual increase is a conservative reflection of the stated strategic goal of **margin expansion** through operational efficiency, suggesting a disciplined but cautious execution.
3.  **ROIC:** The 8.0% ROIC is conservative, slightly lower than the historical figure of 8.53%, to ensure a prudent valuation.
4.  **Discount Rate & Maturity Rate:** The 9.0% Discount Rate is appropriate for a stable, mature, but moderately leveraged consumer staple company. The 1.5% Maturity Rate is highly conservative, positioned well below the historical long-term growth of the US economy, fully reflecting the secular challenges and slow-growth industry.

### **Market Comparison & Discrepancy Analysis**

*   **Current Stock Price (Hypothetical):** The calculated Fair Value per share is **$23.29**.
*   **The Market's Assumptions:** If the current market price is significantly different, it implies the market is making a different set of assumptions.

| Market Price vs. Fair Value | Market's Implicit Assumption (If Price is...) | Why My Model is Different |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **...Significantly HIGHER** | **Higher Growth/Margins/Lower Risk:** The market believes REYN's investments in innovation (e.g., Hefty Fabuloso, EcoSave) and cost-cutting will result in higher than 1.5% revenue growth (perhaps 3-4%), and/or much faster margin expansion (e.g., 20-30 bps annually). The market may also be using a lower discount rate (e.g., 8.0%-8.5%), indicating a lower perceived risk. | My model is more conservative by capping long-term growth at 1.5% and slow-walking margin expansion, acknowledging the real drag from the foam plate business and commodity risk mentioned in the transcripts. |
| **...Significantly LOWER** | **Lower Growth/Margins/Higher Risk:** The market believes REYN will fail to execute on its cost and innovation strategy, leading to sustained revenue declines beyond 2025 or margin contraction due to inability to pass on commodity inflation. They might be assuming a higher discount rate (e.g., 10%+), reflecting a perception that REYN's high debt load ($1.735B) poses a greater risk than management's deleveraging efforts suggest. | My model gives management credit for their guided 2025 profitability and their commitment to the "2030 strategic vision." The model assumes they successfully stabilize the core business, which is a key management goal stated in the transcripts. If the market price is low, it suggests a lack of confidence in this execution. |

Given the strict adherence to conservative assumptions and management's own guidance, the calculated fair value of **$23.29** is a *conservative intrinsic value* based on available facts.
