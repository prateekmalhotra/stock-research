## Business Summary

GrafTech International Ltd. operates primarily as a specialized manufacturer and global supplier of graphite electrodes, which are critical components used in Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs). The core business model is vertically integrated, meaning the company controls the supply of its most important raw material, a highly specialized form of carbon called needle coke, through its dedicated manufacturing facility (Seadrift). This internal supply chain allows GrafTech to potentially produce electrodes at a lower cost and with greater reliability than competitors who must buy needle coke on the open market. The electrodes function by conducting massive amounts of electricity necessary to melt scrap metal and turn it into new steel. The customer base is entirely Business-to-Business (B2B), consisting of global steel manufacturers across Asia, Europe, and the Americas who rely on EAF technology. The vast majority of the company's revenue is derived directly from the sale of these graphite electrodes, meaning its financial performance is tightly linked to the production rates and general health of the global steel industry.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant and persistent risk for GrafTech is its extreme dependence on the cyclical nature of the global steel industry. When the economy slows down, demand for steel drops immediately, causing steel mills to reduce production; this, in turn, severely depresses the demand and pricing for GrafTech’s electrodes. Historically, this market has been characterized by sharp 'boom and bust' cycles, which have resulted in massive earnings fluctuations. A current near-term risk includes increased competitive pressure, particularly from Asian manufacturers, which can flood the market and drive down the premium prices GrafTech achieves, eroding its market position. A long-term risk relates to the operational reliability of the Seadrift needle coke facility. If this essential, low-cost raw material supply were disrupted by an accident or breakdown, the company would immediately lose its primary competitive advantage and face increased input costs. Furthermore, sustained high global energy prices pose a risk, as high electricity costs can discourage customers from running energy-intensive EAFs, thereby lowering electrode utilization rates and harming GrafTech’s earnings.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the journey of GrafTech International Ltd. (EAF) in simple, jargon-free English, from its beginning to what it is today.

### **Inception and Core Business**

1.  **Founding and Early Focus:** The company was first established in 1886 under the name National Carbon Company.
2.  **Why the Business was Founded:** The core purpose was, and remains, the manufacture of highly engineered graphite electrodes, which are essential components in making Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steel.
3.  **The Goal (The "What They Do"):** Graphite electrodes act as conductors to deliver massive amounts of electricity into an Electric Arc Furnace, generating the intense heat needed to melt scrap metal and other raw materials to produce steel.
4.  **Corporate Evolution:** The National Carbon Company was acquired by Union Carbide in 1917 and became its Carbon Products Division; it was later renamed UCAR Carbon Company and finally became GrafTech in 2002.

### **Early Innovations and Diversification**

5.  **Pioneering Electrode Technology:** Early in its history, the company was an innovator, introducing the first 12-inch diameter graphite electrodes in 1914 and later developing much larger 30-inch electrodes for Ultra-High Power (UHP) arc furnaces.
6.  **Beyond Steelmaking:** The company also developed other carbon-based solutions, like high-performance carbon fibers and materials used in spacecraft, and even created heat-spreading materials (like its *SpreaderShield* products) for electronics such as laptops and smartphones.
7.  **Optimizing the Product:** A key technical solution came in 2004 with the introduction of an optimized "pinless joint design," which improved the performance and integrity of large-diameter graphite electrodes.

### **The Game-Changing Solution: Vertical Integration**

8.  **A Unique Competitive Advantage:** In 2010, GrafTech made a strategic acquisition that gave them a significant edge: they bought a manufacturer of **petroleum needle coke**.
9.  **Vertical Integration Explained:** This raw material, petroleum needle coke, is the primary, specialized ingredient for making high-quality graphite electrodes, and the supply is often limited.
10. **The Benefit:** By owning the facility that makes this crucial raw material (a strategy called vertical integration), GrafTech became the only large-scale producer largely in control of its own supply chain, leading to better product quality and lower overall costs.

### **Major Tailwinds and Headwinds (The 2018 Cycle and Aftermath)**

11. **The Great Tailwinds of 2018 (The Boom):** A major tailwind hit the industry around 2018 when global graphite electrode supply was constrained, partly due to environmental crackdowns on production in China. This led to record-high prices and massive profits for GrafTech.
12. **A Solution to Lock in Success:** To capitalize on this high-price environment and secure future revenue, GrafTech signed many **Long-Term Agreements (LTAs)**, locking in premium prices with customers for three to five years.
13. **The Subsequent Headwind:** Following the 2018 boom, electrode prices dropped significantly as new supply came online, and the market returned to its typical cyclical nature.
14. **The Problem with the Solution (LTAs):** GrafTech's premium-priced LTAs, which were a great solution during the boom, became a major headwind for its customers and eventually for the company itself; as market prices fell, customers faced financial difficulties and initiated legal action to challenge the expensive contracts.

### **Recent Challenges and Present-Day Focus**

15. **Environmental and Operational Headwinds:** The company faced operational problems, including a temporary shutdown at its Monterrey, Mexico, manufacturing facility following environmental inspections and a labor dispute.
16. **Financial and Cyclical Headwinds:** As the LTAs expired, the company's revenue rapidly declined, and combined with a general slowdown in the global steel industry, rising interest expenses, and market competition, GrafTech began to face a difficult financial environment and a "cash burn."
17. **Current Strategy (Dealing with Headwinds):** To address these issues, the company has focused on reducing costs, managing its cash flow, and optimizing its manufacturing operations; they also recently secured new financing to address immediate liquidity concerns.
18. **The Future Tailwinds:** The long-term outlook for the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking method is generally positive due to its lower carbon footprint compared to traditional steel production, which aligns with the global push for "green steel."
19. **Present Goal:** Today, GrafTech is focused on navigating the challenging part of the business cycle while utilizing its core advantage—its vertical integration into high-quality needle coke—to remain a critical, low-cost supplier to the global EAF steel market.

## Moat Analysis

GrafTech International Ltd.'s (EAF) competitive advantage, or "moat," is primarily built upon a unique, difficult-to-replicate supply chain structure and deep technical integration with its customers.

### The Moat and Differentiation of GrafTech International Ltd.

1.  **Unique Vertical Integration for Structural Cost and Quality Advantage:**
    *   GrafTech is the **only** large-scale graphite electrode manufacturer that is substantially vertically integrated into the production of petroleum needle coke through its Seadrift facility.
    *   Needle coke is the most critical and expensive raw material for making Ultra-High Power (UHP) graphite electrodes, and controlling this supply insulates GrafTech from the extreme price volatility and supply chain disruptions that affect its competitors.
    *   This direct control ensures a consistent supply of "best-in-class" quality needle coke, which is essential for manufacturing the highly durable UHP electrodes needed in modern steelmaking.

2.  **Technical Integration and High Switching Costs (The "Sticky" Customer):**
    *   The company provides its proprietary **ArchiTech® Furnace Productivity System**, an advanced diagnostic and analysis tool that is installed directly on customer Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs).
    *   This system helps steelmakers in real-time to optimize their furnace operations, reduce costs, increase productivity, and troubleshoot problems, creating a deep, integrated technical relationship.
    *   The reliance on this system and the collaborative knowledge-sharing from GrafTech's global technical service team creates significant **switching costs** for customers, making it difficult to switch to a competitor's product once the system is integrated into their production process.

3.  **Data Network Effect (Subtle Advantage):**
    *   By using the ArchiTech system, customers grant GrafTech a license to use the anonymous, aggregated performance data from the more than 250 installed units worldwide.
    *   This massive, global dataset allows GrafTech to continuously analyze and understand EAF performance across the industry, enabling them to refine their electrode designs and service offerings faster and more effectively than rivals.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Special Position in the Market:** GrafTech holds a key position as a global leader in the production of high-quality **Ultra-High Power (UHP)** graphite electrodes, which are essential for the cleaner, more modern Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) method of steel production.
2.  **Historical Reason for Growth:** The company's growth into a market leader is rooted in its early and strategic decision to pursue **vertical integration** by acquiring and developing its Seadrift needle coke facility, securing a permanent, quality-controlled source of the critical raw material.
3.  **Pricing Power is Cyclical:** While the vertical integration provides a low-cost structure, GrafTech's immediate pricing power is often **limited** due to the cyclical nature of the steel industry and vigorous competition, particularly from Chinese producers who may export electrodes at lower prices.
4.  **Contracts are Shifting:** In the past, the company utilized **Long-Term Agreements (LTAs)**, which provided stable, recurring revenue. However, sales volume is currently shifting to non-LTA or spot-market sales, meaning the stickiness is now increasingly reliant on product quality and technical service rather than purely formal contracts.

### Displacement and R&D

1.  **Displacement by Competitors with More Capital is Difficult:**
    *   The UHP graphite electrode market has **high barriers to entry** because it is capital-intensive, technology-sensitive, and oligopolistic (dominated by a few players).
    *   A new player, even one with significant capital, would face immense costs and a long timeline to build a UHP graphite electrode manufacturing plant and, more critically, to replicate or acquire a premium petroleum needle coke production facility like Seadrift.
    *   The extensive time required for a steel mill to test and qualify a new supplier's UHP electrode creates another layer of protection.
2.  **R&D is Crucial for Sustaining the Edge:**
    *   GrafTech's moat is not just about a single asset; it requires **continuous innovation** and a strong technical focus.
    *   The company actively invests in **R&D** and has amassed over 135 patents, focusing on constantly improving electrode quality, durability, and performance to meet the demanding, high-intensity operations of modern EAFs.
    *   Innovation is vital to stay ahead of low-cost competitors and to capitalize on the increasing global shift toward EAF steelmaking, which requires the highest quality UHP electrodes.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of GrafTech International Ltd.'s (EAF) 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement and executive compensation disclosures, the following is an analysis of management incentives:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (GrafTech International Ltd.)**

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

1.  **Low Aggregate Ownership:** The beneficial ownership of common stock by all Directors and Executive Officers *as a group* is very low, approximating only $\mathbf{0.69\%}$ of the outstanding shares.
2.  **Weak Personal Alignment:** This low insider ownership suggests that the personal wealth of the executive team and board is minimally tied to the appreciation of the company's common stock, which is a weak point for direct alignment with broader shareholder interests.
3.  **Significant External Ownership:** For comparison, a single activist investor group, the Undavia Group, holds a substantially larger stake of approximately $5.9\%$ of the outstanding shares, indicating greater direct financial motivation from key external stakeholders than from the management group itself.

#### **Compensation Structure and Metrics**

4.  **High "At-Risk" Pay:** The executive compensation structure is heavily weighted toward performance-based incentives, with $\mathbf{69\%}$ of Named Executive Officer (NEO) pay, and $\mathbf{85\%}$ of the CEO's pay, classified as "at risk" (variable compensation). [cite: 7 in step 2]
5.  **Short-Term Incentives (STIP):** The Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) is primarily tied to financial and operational metrics, including **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Adjusted Free Cash Flow**, along with certain non-financial corporate objectives (like safety and sustainability metrics).
6.  **Long-Term Incentives (LTI) Focus on Retention:** Recent long-term equity grants (such as in 2022) were in the form of **time-based** Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and stock options. Time-based vesting is an effective tool for executive retention but does not tie the ultimate payout value directly to specific, relative shareholder performance metrics (like Relative Total Shareholder Return or ROIC).

#### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

7.  **Incentives are Primarily Operational (Not Stock-Price Driven):** The significant "at-risk" pay is heavily based on internal operational metrics like Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. While these metrics are important, they may not perfectly correlate with sustainable stock price appreciation, suggesting management's primary focus is on internal operations rather than the stock price.
8.  **Risk of "Lining Pockets":** The combination of very low aggregate insider ownership and the structure of long-term incentives largely consisting of time-based awards for retention, rather than performance-based equity, creates a moderate risk that executives are sufficiently incentivized to *stay* and hit internal targets to receive their pay, but lack sufficient personal equity motivation to aggressively drive significant, long-term shareholder value.
9.  **Unprofitable Performance vs. Pay:** The fact that the CEO’s compensation reportedly increased during a period when the company was unprofitable further suggests a potential disconnect between pay outcomes and absolute shareholder returns. [cite: 3 in step 1]

---

## Price History

The price history for GrafTech International Ltd. (EAF) shows significant volatility, recent major corporate action, and a considerable run-up in the stock price over the last month.

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** GrafTech International Ltd. (EAF) has a 52-week trading range of $\$5.50$ to $\$25.30$. The stock is currently trading approximately **$151.45\%$** above its 52-week low of $\$5.50$, based on a recent closing price of around $\$13.83$.
2.  **Recent Stock Performance (Up Bigly):** The stock has been trading significantly higher in the short term, posting a rise of approximately **$38.30\%$** in the last month.
3.  **Technical Analysis and Trend:** Technical indicators show a mixed signal: while the long-term trend is neutral, the short-term trend is currently **positive (up)**. However, some daily technical readings, including moving averages, were recently summarized as a "Strong Sell," and high Stochastics suggest the stock may be overbought after the sharp run-up, indicating a high level of recent volatility.
4.  **Explanation for Recent Surge:** The rapid increase in the stock price is likely tied to two major corporate events announced in August 2025: the company successfully **regained compliance** with the NYSE listing standards and enacted a **1-for-10 reverse stock split**. The reverse split, which dramatically increases the share price, and the compliance news often precede significant trading volatility and upward pressure, even if temporary.
5.  **Explanation for Historical Price Pressure (Drops):** A contributing factor to the lower prices over the past couple of years was weak earnings performance and a poor outlook for a prior year (2023), reflecting challenges in the industry.
6.  **Fundamentals and Business Progress:** The company reported a net loss for the second quarter of 2025, but it also showed progress toward normalization by achieving a **13% year-over-year reduction in cash costs** and generating **positive Adjusted EBITDA**. The firm's liquidity position remains strong at $\$367$ million, which helps manage near-term industry challenges.

## Long Thesis

GrafTech’s bull case centers on its unique, cost-saving advantage: it is the only major manufacturer that controls the supply of its crucial, specialized raw material (needle coke). This vertical integration provides better quality and insulation from soaring input costs. Near-term, the company is stabilizing by aggressively cutting costs, generating positive operational cash flow, and winning back market share in profitable regions like the U.S. The key long-term driver is the global transition to 'green steel,' which involves replacing traditional, polluting furnaces with Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs). Since EAFs absolutely rely on GrafTech’s graphite electrodes, this trend represents a massive, sustained growth opportunity for demand over the next decade. As overall demand rises, GrafTech's low-cost structure and deep technical integration with customers will allow it to capture premium prices and generate strong profits.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case assumes that the global shift toward 'green steel' and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production will proceed as planned, translating announced capacity growth into actual demand for graphite electrodes. It requires that GrafTech maintains its critical cost advantage by keeping the specialized Seadrift needle coke facility running reliably and efficiently. Furthermore, management must successfully execute its plan to cut cash costs and capture higher sales volumes in Western markets, overcoming persistent cyclical volatility and intense pricing competition from Asian rivals.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for GrafTech International Ltd. (EAF) contains critical flaws and omits significant financial risks, primarily centered on its debt burden and vulnerability to the highly cyclical and competitive nature of the graphite electrode market.

Here is a critique and a bear case thesis identifying the holes and faults in the bull case:

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Massive Debt Overhang Neutralizes Cost Advantage:** The claim of generating "strong profits" is severely undermined by the company's substantial gross debt of approximately **$1.125 billion** (as of Q4 2024). This debt requires significant semi-annual interest payments, which act as a massive fixed cost and a persistent drain on cash flow, making it extremely difficult to translate lower input costs into meaningful net profits for shareholders.
2.  **Failure to Generate Positive Operational Cash Flow:** The assertion of "generating positive operational cash flow" is contradicted by recent financial reports. GrafTech reported a net loss of **$131 million** for the full year 2024 and consistently showed negative net cash used in operating activities and negative adjusted free cash flow throughout the year, despite the cost-cutting efforts.
3.  **Cost Cuts and Volume Gains are Offset by Pricing Collapse:** While the company successfully reduced its cash cost per metric ton by 23% in 2024 and grew sales volume by 13%, the corresponding drop in average realized selling price for its spot market (non-LTA) volume (a 19% decline in Q4 2024) indicates a brutal pricing environment. This means the volume is being won through deep price concessions, directly countering the bull thesis's belief that a low-cost structure will allow them to "capture premium prices."
4.  **Vertical Integration is Now a Competitive Liability for Cash Flow:** The unique vertical integration via the Seadrift needle coke facility, while providing quality and cost insulation, locks up capital in a manufacturing process that is now facing intense competition from two sides:
    *   **Graphite Electrodes:** Low-priced competition from Asian rivals continues to depress selling prices.
    *   **Needle Coke:** Demand for the same petroleum needle coke from the booming **Electric Vehicle (EV) battery market** (synthetic graphite anodes) is creating competing demand, potentially increasing the internal opportunity cost of the raw material.
5.  **Cyclicality and Weak Demand are Unaddressed Near-Term Risks:** The thesis underplays the persistent cyclical volatility. Management itself describes the current pricing environment as "unsustainably low" and expects near-term demand to "remain weak" due to global economic uncertainty and constrained steel production. The long-term "green steel" tailwind does not mitigate the crushing reality of the current downcycle.
6.  **"Green Steel" Growth is an Industry-Wide Benefit, Not an EAF-Specific Moat:** The shift to EAF steelmaking is a valid long-term driver (with an estimated market CAGR of 4.45% to 6.3% for graphite electrodes), but this secular growth will benefit the entire industry, including competitors that are aggressively expanding capacity (like HEG) and localizing technology (like POSCO in Asia). GrafTech’s market share gains in profitable Western regions will be hard-fought and expensive to maintain given the global capacity.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for GrafTech International Ltd. (EAF)

The bear case for GrafTech centers on its **crushing debt load** and its **vulnerability to intense cyclical and competitive pressures** that prevent its vertical integration advantage from generating sustainable free cash flow.

1.  **Debt-Driven Financial Distress and Cash Drain:** GrafTech's significant net debt makes it extremely susceptible to any downturn in the steel market, as cash flow must first service interest payments rather than fund growth, dividends, or debt reduction. The company has shown persistent negative operating and free cash flow, indicating that current operations are insufficient to cover capital expenditures and interest, forcing continued reliance on liquidity management over true profitability.
2.  **Commodity Pricing and Asian Competition Pressure:** The company is a price-taker in a highly competitive global commodity market, a fact evidenced by the significant decline in realized non-LTA (spot) prices. Aggressive Asian competitors continue to add capacity and sell at low prices, ensuring that a large portion of the market remains "unsustainably low" and eroding any "premium pricing" power GrafTech's quality or vertical integration might otherwise confer.
3.  **Vertical Integration Challenge from the EV Market:** The prized asset, Seadrift's petroleum needle coke, faces increasing non-electrode demand from the booming electric vehicle (EV) battery sector. This competing high-growth market for the raw material introduces an increasing opportunity cost for the coke used internally, potentially undermining the long-term cost advantage, especially if GrafTech's ability to sell the material externally is limited.
4.  **High Barrier to Net Profitability:** Despite successful cost-cutting and volume increases, the company remains unprofitable on a net income and adjusted EBITDA basis (only $2 million in Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024), demonstrating that the current market price environment and high fixed costs (primarily debt servicing) are creating a deep hole that volume and modest cost reductions cannot overcome in the near-to-medium term.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis is strong and highlights the critical tension between the unique long-term competitive advantage (vertical integration) and the crushing near-term financial reality (massive debt burden and cyclical pricing).

The single most important question left unanswered is whether the company can generate enough **Free Cash Flow** to pay its massive debt interest expense and survive until the "green steel" tailwind arrives.

Here are the most important questions and next steps for further investigation:

### Key Unanswered Questions and Next Steps

1.  **Quantify the Annual Debt Service Cash Drain:**
    *   **Action:** Search for the specific coupon rate(s) and the total annual cash interest expense (or semi-annual interest payment amounts) for the $\mathbf{\$1.125 \text{ billion}}$ in second lien notes due 2029.
    *   **Why:** We know the debt maturity is pushed out to 2029, which is good, but the *interest payments* are the immediate and persistent cash drain. Understanding the exact annual figure is necessary to accurately compare it against the company's current and projected Adjusted EBITDA/Operating Cash Flow.

2.  **Determine the True Value and Monetization of Seadrift's Needle Coke:**
    *   **Action:** Investigate the specifics of the premium petroleum needle coke market. Specifically, look for the **external, non-electrode market price (e.g., for EV batteries)** versus the **internal transfer price** GrafTech uses for its own electrodes.
    *   **Why:** The bear case mentions the opportunity cost, which is the most critical risk/reward for the "moat." If the external EV market price for needle coke is significantly higher than the internal cost savings, the vertical integration may become a value destroyer (a capital asset producing a lower margin product than the raw material could fetch).

3.  **Validate the Ability to Sustain Price Increases in a Competitive Market:**
    *   **Action:** Search for recent market intelligence or analyst commentary on the success of GrafTech’s stated intention to implement a $\mathbf{15\%}$ price increase on uncommitted (spot) volume for 2025.
    *   **Why:** The bull case rests on capturing premium prices, but the bear case points to collapsing spot prices. The price increase is a direct test of the company's pricing power in the current market, and its success is a powerful near-term indicator of the cycle turning.

4.  **Assess the Specific Demands and Influence of the Activist Director:**
    *   **Action:** Search for commentary or press releases from the new board member (Sachin Shivaram, appointed via the Undavia Group agreement in January 2025) or the Undavia Group itself since the appointment.
    *   **Why:** The activist investor is a large, motivated shareholder now represented on the board by a steel industry veteran. This person is highly likely to push for a specific strategic or financial overhaul (e.g., debt restructuring, Seadrift asset sale/partial spinoff, or a major change in capital allocation) that could serve as an immediate, non-cyclical catalyst.

5.  **Analyze the Long-Term Agreement (LTA) Backlog Status (Remaining Buffer):**
    *   **Action:** Search for the latest update on the remaining volume of electrodes still under the old, premium-priced Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) for 2025 and 2026.
    *   **Why:** The LTA volume provides a critical, high-priced revenue floor. Understanding the exact remaining "runoff" is essential for forecasting the $\mathbf{2026}$ financial results, as its expiration will drop all volume into the lower-priced spot market, unless the cycle has turned by then.
