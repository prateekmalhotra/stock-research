### 2. Business Engine & Revenue Forecast (2025–2030)

The valuation model is built upon a conservative assessment of BYD's core business drivers, as outlined in recent earnings call transcripts.

**The Business Engine:**
Boyd Gaming's engine is driven primarily by its geographically diversified portfolio of casinos, with a strong focus on the stable, high-margin **Las Vegas Locals** market and a steady **Midwest & South** regional business. The key to the forecast is capturing the high, sustainable **property-level margins** (consistently above 40% EBITDAR) and the impact of significant near-term **capital-investment-driven growth**.

**Management Guided Growth Drivers:**
*   **Property Upgrades/Expansions:** The company is reinvesting to maintain the high operating margin and capture local market growth.
*   **Cadence Crossing Casino:** This new development in the high-growth Cadence master-planned community in Las Vegas is expected to replace the existing Joker's Wild, providing a significant **step-up** in the high-margin Locals segment revenue starting in mid-2026.
*   **Virginia Casino Development:** A new market entry and significant growth capital project (\$150M-\$200M) expected to drive long-term value, which will be a **new revenue stream**.
*   **Online Segment Headwind:** The company explicitly guided for a decline in Online EBITDAR, from an estimated $\sim$\$50-60M in 2025 down to **\$30 million in 2026** due to new commercial terms. This acts as a dampener on overall growth in 2026.

**Revenue Forecast Rationale:**
The model uses a conservative baseline and conservative growth rates that are below historical averages to account for economic conservatism.

1.  **FY 2025 Base Revenue:**
    *   Q1 2025 $\sim$\$1.0B (Step 1) + Q2 2025 \$1.03B + Q3 2025 \$1.0B + Q4 2025 (Estimate) \$1.0B = **\$4.03 Billion**.

2.  **Growth Rate Assumptions:**
    *   **2026 (2.0% Growth):** This slow growth reflects the net effect of the new, higher-revenue properties (Cadence Crossing/Ameristar expansion) starting mid-year, being largely offset by the management-guided **Online segment EBITDAR decline** (headwind) and conservative organic growth in the base business.
    *   **2027–2028 (4.0% Growth):** The highest growth years reflect the **full-year impact** of Cadence Crossing and the expected ramp-up and opening of the **Virginia Casino** development, which represents a new, high-potential market.
    *   **2029–2030 (2.5% Growth):** A reversion to a lower, conservative growth rate as the new properties mature, reflecting a stable, mature regional gaming market, slightly above the long-term terminal growth rate.

| Year | Revenue (USD MM) | Growth Rate | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$4,030 | Base Year | (Q1+Q2+Q3 Actual + Q4 Estimate) |
| **2026** | \$4,111 | 2.0% | New projects start, offset by Online EBITDAR decline. |
| **2027** | \$4,275 | 4.0% | Full-year impact of Cadence Crossing, ramp-up of Virginia casino. |
| **2028** | \$4,446 | 4.0% | Full-year impact of all major projects. |
| **2029** | \$4,557 | 2.5% | Reversion to long-term mature growth. |
| **2030** | \$4,671 | 2.5% | Mature growth. |

### 3. Margin & Net Income Projection

**Net Income Margin (NIM) Assumption:**
The company has consistently maintained very strong property-level margins (EBITDAR) above 40%. However, Net Income is lower due to interest on debt, depreciation, and corporate taxes.

*   **Conservative NIM:** A conservative **10.0% Net Income Margin** is assumed for all projection years. This is significantly lower than the company's non-recurring Q3 2025 NIM of 46% (due to the FanDuel sale), and far more conservative than many long-term analyst estimates. It reflects the stable, cash-generative nature of the business while factoring in all operational and non-operational costs.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**
The rule is to calculate Net Income for the next year as: `NI_t = (Revenue_t * NIM) + (ROIC * NI_t-1)`. The company has stated its capital projects offer a **strong return on investment**.

*   **Conservative ROIC:** A conservative and reasonable ROIC of **10.0%** is applied to the prior year's net income (assumed to be fully reinvested cash). This is a prudent assumption, especially given the company's strong EBITDAR margins and the projected long-term value from their new, high-return capital projects.

**Projected Net Income Calculation:**

| Year | Revenue (USD MM) | Net Income from Revenue (10.0% NIM) | Prior Year Net Income (NI_t-1) | ROIC Income (NI_t-1 * 10.0%) | Total Net Income (USD MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$4,030 | \$403.0 | N/A | N/A | **\$403.0** |
| **2026** | \$4,111 | \$411.1 | \$403.0 | \$40.3 | **\$451.4** |
| **2027** | \$4,275 | \$427.5 | \$451.4 | \$45.1 | **\$472.6** |
| **2028** | \$4,446 | \$444.6 | \$472.6 | \$47.3 | **\$491.9** |
| **2029** | \$4,557 | \$455.7 | \$491.9 | \$49.2 | **\$504.9** |
| **2030** | \$4,671 | \$467.1 | \$504.9 | \$50.5 | **\$517.6** |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

For this valuation, Net Income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) as per the rule: "Assume that net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."

**Valuation Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative **9.0%** is used. This is a reasonable mid-to-high discount rate for a stable regional casino business with a moderate debt load and reflects the risk premium associated with the consumer discretionary sector.
*   **Conservative Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate (g):** A very conservative **2.0%** is assumed, reflecting a stable, mature, long-term growth rate below the growth rate of the general economy.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**
*   TV = [FCF_2030 * (1 + g)] / (Discount Rate - g)
*   TV = [\$517.6 MM * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.09 - 0.02)
*   TV = \$528.05 MM / 0.07 = **\$7,543.6 Million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows:**

| Year | Total Net Income (FCF) (USD MM) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) (USD MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$451.4 | 0.917 | \$414.0 |
| **2027** | \$472.6 | 0.842 | \$398.0 |
| **2028** | \$491.9 | 0.772 | \$379.8 |
| **2029** | \$504.9 | 0.708 | \$357.5 |
| **2030 (Operating FCF)**| \$517.6 | 0.650 | \$336.4 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)**| \$7,543.6 | 0.650 | \$4,903.3 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | **\$6,789.0** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$6,789.0 | Sum of PVs (2026-2030) |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents**| \$319.1 | As of Sep 30, 2025 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$1,900.0 | As of Sep 30, 2025 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$5,208.1** | (\$6,789.0 + \$319.1 - \$1,900.0) |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 80.18 million | |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$64.96** | (\$5,208.1 MM / 80.18 MM shares) |

### Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **\$64.96** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$78.92** |
| **Difference (Undervaluation) / Overvaluation** | **-\$13.96 (Overvaluation)** |
| **Percentage Difference** | **-17.69%** |

**Justification for Discrepancy:**

The calculated fair value of **\$64.96** is $\sim$17.7% lower than the current market price of **\$78.92**. This suggests the market is implicitly making more aggressive assumptions about BYD's future performance than this conservative model.

The market's assumptions appear to be:

1.  **Higher Growth/Larger Impact from New Projects:** The market is likely pricing in a more substantial and immediate revenue boost from the new developments like **Cadence Crossing** and the **Virginia Casino** starting in 2026/2027. My model uses a conservative 4.0% peak growth, while the market may be expecting 5-7% growth in the out-years to justify the higher price.
2.  **A Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** A 2.0% terminal growth rate is very conservative for a growth company. If the market were to assume a slightly higher long-term growth rate, say **2.5%** (a small difference in assumption), the fair value would increase to **\$72.18**, significantly closing the gap.
3.  **Multiple Re-rating Post-FanDuel Transaction:** The recent sale of the FanDuel stake and subsequent capital return program demonstrates management's focus on shareholder value and a "cleaner" balance sheet. The market may be assigning a higher valuation multiple (P/E or EV/EBITDA) to the remaining core casino business due to this de-risking and management's renewed focus, leading to a higher share price.
4.  **ROIC/Reinvestment Success:** The market has a higher conviction in the management's guidance of "strong return on investment" for the capital projects. My model's 10.0% ROIC may be viewed as too conservative by investors who expect a higher rate of return on the new, high-growth capital.

**Conclusion:**
While the conservative DCF model suggests an overvaluation, the difference is primarily attributable to a conservative terminal growth rate and modest revenue assumptions for the new capital projects. The model's conservatism is justified by the volatile nature of the casino industry and the goal of establishing a margin of safety. The market appears to be giving more credit to the high-return capital projects and the company's robust, high-margin **Las Vegas Locals** business, which has proven resilient.
