# Valuation of Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD) Stock

## **Part 1: Initial Financial Data and Assumptions**

All financial data is based on information reported in SEC filings and earnings call summaries, primarily from the Full-Year 2025 and Q4 2025 results.

### **1. Core Financial Data (as of December 31, 2025)**

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$353.4 | Q4/FY 2025 results [cite: 1 (from step 1 search)] |
| **Total Debt** | \$2,100.0 | Q4/FY 2025 results (Used latest figure) [cite: 1 (from step 1 search)] |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 76.4 million | End of 2025 share count [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)] |
| **Full-Year 2025 Revenue** | \$4,100.0 | Reported FY 2025 revenues [cite: 1 (from step 1 search)] |
| **Current Stock Price** | \$83.27 | Most recent closing price as of the last search |

### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Drivers (2026-2030)**

The core business engine of Boyd Gaming is driven by its diverse portfolio, mainly focusing on **Las Vegas Locals** and **Midwest & South** segments, with stable, high-margin play from core customers. Future growth will be primarily inorganic and project-based.

**Conservative Assumptions & Justification:**

*   **Core Revenue Growth (Organic):** I assume a conservative annual organic growth rate of **1.5%** for the existing property base (Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas, Midwest & South). This reflects steady population growth in key markets and continued strength in core customer play, offset by the mentioned "softness in destination business" [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)].
*   **Projected Growth from New Developments:**
    *   **Cadence Crossing Casino:** Opening late March 2026 [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)]. As a new Southern Nevada locals casino, I conservatively estimate it will contribute **\$80 million** in incremental revenue starting in 2026 (partial year effect), and **\$120 million** annually starting in 2027 (full year effect).
    *   **Norfolk, Virginia Resort:** Expected to open in late 2027 [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)]. As a large, best-in-market casino resort with a \$750M investment, I conservatively estimate **\$100 million** in incremental revenue in 2028 (partial year effect) and **\$250 million** annually starting in 2029 (full year effect).
    *   **Par-A-Dice Redevelopment:** Completion expected in 2028 [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)]. I conservatively estimate this facility will contribute **\$25 million** in incremental revenue starting in 2029.
    *   **Managed & Online Revenue:** Based on management's 2026 guidance for EBITDAR (\$30M Online + \$110M Managed = $\sim\$140$ million total core EBITDAR) [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)], and assuming a stable core revenue contribution (let's use **\$500 million** for 2025 based on historical reports and segment detail from the 10-Q [cite: 3 (from step 1 search)]) for the total segment, I project a modest **2.0%** annual growth rate for the **Total Online & Managed Segment Revenue** after 2026. For 2026, I will keep it flat at \$500M and let the EBITDAR projection account for the growth.

### **3. Margin Assumptions and Core Net Income**

| Metric | Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin** | $\sim$**9.76%** (2025 Core) | Calculated based on 2025 Core Performance (see calculation below). |
| **Future Net Income Margin** | **10.0%** | Conservative, slightly higher than the 2025 core rate to reflect high-margin new assets coming online, stable cost management, and the high historical *Property Operating Margin* of 40% [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)]. I will cap it at 10.0% to be conservative.
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | **10.0%** | A conservative but reasonable positive ROIC. The company has a strong cash-generating core business (40% property margin) [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)] and is investing heavily in high-return new projects (Norfolk, Cadence, Par-A-Dice) [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)], justifying a stable and healthy reinvestment return.

**2025 Core Net Income Calculation (for margin baseline):**
*   Full-Year 2025 Revenue: \$4,100.0 million
*   Full-Year 2025 Net Income: \$1,800.0 million [cite: 1 (from step 1 search)]. (This includes $\sim\$1.4$ billion after-tax gain from FanDuel, which must be removed to find *Core* Net Income).
*   **Estimated Core Net Income (2025):** $\sim$\$400.0 million (\$1,800.0M - \$1,400.0M one-time gain) [cite: 1 (from step 1 search)].
*   **Core Net Income Margin (2025):** \$400.0M / \$4,100.0M = **9.76%**

## **Part 2: Projected Revenue and Net Income (2025-2030)**

### **1. Projected Revenue (in Millions USD)**

| Year | Core Organic Growth (1.5%) | Cadence Crossing | Norfolk Resort | Par-A-Dice | Managed/Online Growth (2.0%) | Total Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | **\$4,100.0** |
| **2026** | \$61.5 (4100 \* 1.5%) | \$80.0 | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | \$10.0 | **\$4,251.5** |
| **2027** | \$63.8 (4251.5 \* 1.5%) | \$40.0 (Incremental) | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | \$10.2 | **\$4,365.5** |
| **2028** | \$65.5 (4365.5 \* 1.5%) | \$0.0 | \$100.0 | \$0.0 | \$10.4 | **\$4,541.4** |
| **2029** | \$68.1 (4541.4 \* 1.5%) | \$0.0 | \$150.0 (Incremental) | \$25.0 | \$10.6 | **\$4,795.1** |
| **2030** | \$71.9 (4795.1 \* 1.5%) | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | \$10.8 | **\$4,877.8** |

### **2. Projected Net Income (in Millions USD)**

We use the following formula for Projected Net Income:
**Net Income (Year N) = (Projected Revenue \* Net Income Margin) + (Prior Year Retained Earnings \* ROIC)**

*   **Net Income Margin:** 10.0%
*   **ROIC (Reinvestment Rate):** 10.0%
*   **Initial Retained Earnings (2025):** Core Net Income: \$400.0M. *Note: We assume the cash from the FanDuel sale was used for the stated debt reduction and share repurchase programs, leaving the core net income as the first year's cash flow for reinvestment purposes.*

| Year | Projected Revenue | Net Income from Operations (10.0%) | Plus: ROIC from Prior Year Retained Earnings | Total Projected Net Income | Retained Earnings for Next Year (Cumulative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$4,100.0 | \$410.0 | N/A | **\$410.0** | \$410.0 |
| **2026** | \$4,251.5 | \$425.2 | \$41.0 (410.0 \* 10.0%) | **\$466.2** | \$876.2 (410.0 + 466.2) |
| **2027** | \$4,365.5 | \$436.6 | \$87.6 (876.2 \* 10.0%) | **\$524.2** | \$1,400.4 (876.2 + 524.2) |
| **2028** | \$4,541.4 | \$454.1 | \$140.0 (1400.4 \* 10.0%) | **\$594.1** | \$1,994.5 (1400.4 + 594.1) |
| **2029** | \$4,795.1 | \$479.5 | \$199.5 (1994.5 \* 10.0%) | **\$679.0** | \$2,673.5 (1994.5 + 679.0) |
| **2030** | \$4,877.8 | \$487.8 | \$267.4 (2673.5 \* 10.0%) | **\$755.2** | N/A (Terminal Year) |

## **Part 3: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

### **1. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is a conservative WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) estimate for a mature, stable gaming company with modest leverage (ending 2025 leverage was low at 1.7x total leverage [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)]).
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **3.0%**. This is a very conservative terminal growth rate, reflecting long-term inflation and a mature casino market. It is well below the long-term organic revenue growth and well below the long-term growth of the economy.

### **2. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

**A. Present Value of Projected Cash Flows (2026-2030):**

| Year | Projected Net Income (CF) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (N=1)** | \$466.2 | 0.917 | \$427.6 |
| **2027 (N=2)** | \$524.2 | 0.842 | \$441.5 |
| **2028 (N=3)** | \$594.1 | 0.772 | \$458.7 |
| **2029 (N=4)** | \$679.0 | 0.708 | \$480.9 |
| **2030 (N=5)** | \$755.2 | 0.650 | \$490.9 |
| **Total PV of Explicit Period (2026-2030)** | | | **\$2,299.6** |

**B. Present Value of Terminal Value (2031 to Infinity):**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
Terminal Value (2030) = [CF (2030) \* (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
Terminal Value (2030) = [\$755.2 \* (1 + 0.03)] / (0.09 - 0.03)
Terminal Value (2030) = \$777.9 / 0.06 = **\$12,965.0 million**

Present Value of Terminal Value = Terminal Value (2030) \* Discount Factor (2030)
Present Value of Terminal Value = \$12,965.0 million \* 0.650 = **\$8,427.3 million**

**C. Total Net Present Value (NPV):**

NPV = PV of Explicit Period + PV of Terminal Value
NPV = \$2,299.6 million + \$8,427.3 million = **\$10,726.9 million**

## **Part 4: Fair Value Calculation and Conclusion**

### **1. Fair Value Calculation (in Millions USD, except per share data)**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | \$10,726.9 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$353.4 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$2,100.0 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$8,980.3** |
| **Divided by: Shares Outstanding** | 76.4 million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$117.54** |

### **2. Conclusion and Justification**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **\$117.54** |
| **Current Market Price per Share** | \$83.27 |
| **Difference (Undervaluation)** | **41.2%** |

#### **Justification for Disparity**

The calculated fair value of **\$117.54** is **41.2% higher** than the current market price of \$83.27. This significant difference suggests that the market's underlying assumptions about Boyd Gaming's future cash flows are substantially more conservative than this valuation.

**Why the Valuation is Higher (The Market's Conservative Assumptions):**

1.  **Discounted Future Growth from Projects:** The market is likely *highly discounting* the revenue and margin potential of the new capital projects (Cadence Crossing, Norfolk Resort, Par-A-Dice) [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)]. Casino projects, especially new ground-up resorts like Norfolk (\$750M investment) [cite: 4 (from step 1 search)], carry execution risk, construction delays, and uncertainty regarding the eventual market size and ramp-up time. The market may be assuming the Norfolk opening in late 2027 is a "best-case scenario" and is assigning a much lower terminal growth rate to the incremental revenue.
2.  **Core Business Saturation/Cyclicality:** The market may be pricing in a much slower core organic growth rate (lower than 1.5% and approaching 0%) due to the macro-economic environment and the cyclical nature of the gaming industry. The management commentary mentioned "softness in destination business" [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)], which could be interpreted by the market as a persistent headwind.
3.  **ROIC Skepticism:** The market may be skeptical that the company can achieve a long-term 10.0% ROIC on its retained earnings, or it may be assuming the cash flow from the non-recurring FanDuel transaction is already fully utilized, limiting the retained earnings available for growth.
4.  **Conservative Terminal Growth:** A key driver of the high DCF is the perpetuity value. The market may be using a lower Terminal Growth Rate (e.g., closer to 1.0%-1.5%) to reflect a mature, low-growth industry, which would significantly decrease the calculated NPV.

**Defense of Fair Value:**

This valuation is based on a conservative model grounded in management's stated project timelines and historical performance:
*   The **1.5% organic growth rate** is very modest for a diversified casino operator.
*   The **10.0% ROIC** is justified by the company's long-standing operational efficiency (40% property operating margins) [cite: 2 (from step 1 search)] and its strategy of only pursuing high-ROI capital projects.
*   The **3.0% Maturity Rate** is conservative, allowing the business to grow just above a core inflation rate.

The difference in value indicates the market is applying a significant discount for execution risk and macroeconomic uncertainty, effectively pricing the stock as a lower-growth or lower-return business than what its current capital investment plan suggests.
