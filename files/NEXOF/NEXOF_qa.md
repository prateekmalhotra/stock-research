## Business Summary

NEXON Co., Ltd. is a global leader in developing and publishing online video games, relying heavily on the "free-to-play" business model. This means the company offers its games free of charge to download and play, but generates revenue by selling virtual goods, such as cosmetic items, character enhancements, or time-saving tools, inside the game. This revenue stream is called microtransactions, and it relies on a dedicated, smaller group of players (often referred to as “whales”) who spend significant amounts of money. Geographically, NEXON's core earnings are historically concentrated in Asia, particularly South Korea and China, where its flagship PC online games like *Dungeon Fighter Online* and *MapleStory* retain immense popularity among dedicated online gaming demographics. The company is actively working to expand its customer base into North America and Europe.

## Business Model Risk

The company faces significant near-term and long-term risks primarily stemming from its dependency on a few successful, but aging, intellectual properties (IP). A major near-term threat is the reliance on flagship titles like *Dungeon Fighter Online*; if regulatory changes in China (a crucial market for this game) occur, or if a major competitor draws away players, NEXON’s earnings could immediately suffer. This vulnerability has been a constant concern, as previous attempts to successfully replicate the success of these older IPs with new titles have sometimes failed to meet high market expectations. In the long term, the company faces intense competition in game quality and player retention. The video game industry requires continuous, large investments in new titles, and if NEXON fails to produce new blockbuster hits or adapt quickly to technological shifts (like cloud gaming), its market position will erode. Additionally, a serious threat across the industry is increasing regulatory scrutiny of microtransaction practices, especially the use of 'loot box' or 'gacha' mechanics (where players pay for random virtual items). Historically, changes to monetization rules in markets like South Korea have forced operational shifts; further governmental intervention, particularly in Europe or the US, could force NEXON to revamp its high-margin revenue structures, significantly harming its profitability.

## Company History

NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF) is a global leader in the online and mobile gaming industry, best known for pioneering a business model that is now used by most of the world's biggest video games.

Here is a detailed history of the company, from its inception to the present day.

---

### **The Founding and Early Innovation (1994-2002)**

1.  **Inception and Founder:** NEXON was founded in December 1994 in Seoul, South Korea, by Kim Jung-ju, who was then pursuing a doctorate in computer science.
2.  **The Core Vision (Why it was Founded):** Kim Jung-ju's goal was to build a new kind of social entertainment by connecting people through games over the rapidly developing internet. The company aimed to take the gaming experience out of the single-player console and put it into a persistent, shared, online world.
3.  **The First Major Innovation:** In 1996, NEXON launched its first major title, *Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds*, which is considered one of the world's first graphical Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). This game allowed thousands of players to interact in a shared virtual world for the first time.
4.  **Major Tailwind: The PC Bang Culture:** This early success was boosted by a powerful local trend in South Korea called the **PC Bang culture** (Internet cafes entirely dedicated to gaming). Since not everyone could afford a fast computer or reliable internet at home, players flocked to these cafes, providing an instant, massive, and social audience for NEXON’s online games.

### **The Business Model Revolution (2003-2010)**

5.  **The Free-to-Play Revolution (F2P):** NEXON's truly world-changing innovation, perfected with games like *MapleStory* (2003) and *Dungeon & Fighter* (2005), was the "Free-to-Play" (F2P) model.
6.  **Solving the Customer Problem:** Instead of the old model where players paid a high upfront fee and a monthly subscription fee, NEXON allowed everyone to download and play the core game for free. This drastically lowered the barrier for new players and made the games instantly popular worldwide.
7.  **The Monetization Solution (Microtransactions):** NEXON's revenue came from selling non-essential virtual items—called **microtransactions**—such as cosmetic costumes, unique pets, or small items that offered a slight convenience or time-saving benefit. This shifted the focus from a one-time sale to building a loyal community that would stay and spend small amounts over many years.
8.  **Global Expansion:** Due to the F2P model’s success in markets like Korea and China, NEXON moved its corporate headquarters from Seoul to Tokyo, Japan, in 2005 to better manage its rapidly expanding global operations.

### **Headwinds and the Quest for Transparency (2011-2022)**

9.  **Financial Milestone:** In 2011, NEXON went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TYO: 3659), in what was the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) in Japan that year, signifying its status as a global gaming powerhouse.
10. **Major Headwind: The "Loot Box" Scandal:** A significant crisis arose over a feature in *MapleStory* known as "Cubes," which were probabilistic items (often called **loot boxes**). Players paid real money for a random chance to win powerful character upgrades.
11. **The Problem of Player Trust:** Investigations by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC) revealed that between 2010 and 2016, NEXON had secretly changed the odds of winning certain desirable items, sometimes even setting the probability to zero without notifying players, which was a clear breach of trust.
12. **The Innovative Solution: Regulatory Change and Transparency:** This controversy resulted in a player lawsuit that went to the Supreme Court, a record-setting fine of 11.6 billion won from the FTC, and massive user boycotts. The long-term solution was not just a company fix, but a regulatory one: the pressure forced the South Korean government to introduce and enforce stricter laws requiring game companies to **disclose the exact probability of all paid random items**, making the entire F2P market more transparent.

### **Present Day and Future Goals (2023-Present)**

13. **Continued Strength of Old IP:** Today, the company remains highly reliant on its established franchises, or **Intellectual Property (IP)**, with games like *Dungeon & Fighter* and *MapleStory* continuing to generate significant revenue, sometimes decades after their launch.
14. **Current Strategy: The IP Growth Initiative (2024):** NEXON’s current strategy is centered on an "**IP Growth Initiative**" to maintain stable growth.
    *   **Vertical Growth:** This involves extending successful classic franchises to new platforms, such as launching mobile and console versions of their biggest PC hits.
    *   **Horizontal Growth:** This involves creating new blockbuster hits by investing heavily in new technologies and acquiring and developing innovative new studios, like Embark Studios, which recently launched the popular game *THE FINALS*.
15. **The Ultimate Goal:** NEXON's long-term objective is to maintain its position as a stable and enduring company by turning its most popular game franchises into timeless entertainment pillars, consistently providing engaging online experiences and new titles that appeal to a diverse, global audience.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF) is primarily built on the enduring popularity of its intellectual property (IP) and its pioneering role in the free-to-play online gaming business model.

Here is an analysis of NEXON's competitive advantages and business resilience:

### **Analysis of NEXON's Moat**

1.  **Massive, Durable Intellectual Property (IP):** NEXON’s core business relies on a few multi-decade-old flagship franchises, such as *Dungeon & Fighter* (with over $22 billion in lifetime sales) and *MapleStory* (with over 180 million registered users). These games are a source of highly stable, recurring revenue, as the top three franchises accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company's 2024 revenue.

2.  **Pioneering Free-to-Play Model:** A major reason for NEXON’s initial growth was being one of the first game developers to successfully adopt the **free-to-play business model** in the 1990s, allowing them to capture a massive user base before competitors. This early adoption established their expertise in operating "live service" games that continuously deliver new content and monetize through microtransactions.

3.  **Powerful Network Effects and High Switching Costs:** The long-running franchises benefit from strong network effects, where the game’s value increases as more friends and community members play. A player's progress, social connections, and accumulated in-game items act as **high switching costs**, making it extremely difficult for a player to leave the game for a competitor's new title.

4.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts (Engagement):** The customer relationship is not a one-time purchase, but a continuous, high-engagement commitment to a virtual world. Revenue is highly recurring, generated through the sale of in-game items, such as character cosmetics, convenience items, and character enhancements, which incentivizes players to continually invest their time and money.

### **Differentiation and Special Position**

5.  **Special Pricing Power through Microtransactions:** NEXON does not have traditional pricing power (like raising a subscription fee), but it possesses a unique form of pricing power over its captive user base. This is exerted by selling **differentiated in-game items** (microtransactions) that offer convenience or progress advantage to a highly engaged audience, allowing them to capture significant spending from a small percentage of dedicated players.

6.  **"Live Operations" Expertise:** The company has world-class "Live Game Operations" capabilities, which is the specialized ability to keep a game balanced, refreshed, and profitable for decades with constant updates, new content, and carefully managed in-game economies. This deep expertise is a major differentiator that a competitor cannot easily replicate.

### **Displacement and Future Moat Creation**

7.  **High Barrier to Displacement:** While a competitor with more capital could theoretically enter the market, displacing NEXON is incredibly difficult because of the existing **social gravity** of its core games. A new competitor would have to create an instant cultural phenomenon to lure away a player base whose characters, friendships, and years of progress are locked into NEXON's virtual worlds.

8.  **Heavy Investment in R&D and Innovation:** The company recognizes that reliance on aging IPs is a vulnerability, so it invests heavily in its future moat. NEXON allocates a significant portion of its annual revenue (around 14%) to **Research and Development (R&D)**.

9.  **Strategic IP Expansion (Moat Reinforcement):** NEXON's current strategy, called the **IP Growth Initiative**, is focused on constantly innovating by taking its beloved, established IPs like *MapleStory* and *Dungeon & Fighter* and expanding them vertically into new content, horizontally onto new platforms (mobile, console), and into new regions. This ensures the existing moat is not only maintained but expanded.

2.  **New Global Title Releases:** The successful global launch of the new IP, **The First Descendant**, and the anticipated release of the highly wished-list shooter, **ARC Raiders**, in October are expected to expand the company's international footprint, especially in Western markets.
3.  **Share Buyback Program:** Management has approved a significant $\\¥$100 billion share buyback policy over one year (with a portion already executed), signaling a commitment to enhancing shareholder value and providing a direct boost to earnings per share.
4.  **Established Franchise Momentum:** Content updates and live-service efforts continue to revitalize core franchises, with **Dungeon&Fighter PC** in Korea showing a solid recovery and **MapleStory** franchise revenue also experiencing strong growth.
5.  **New Mobile Launch:** The initial impressive performance of **MABINOGI MOBILE** in its initial launch market is expected to drive additional growth upside in the mobile sector.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 1 Year)

1.  **IP Growth Strategy & Financial Targets:** Management's core strategy is an **"IP Growth Initiative"** focused on **vertical growth** (product extensions, new platforms) and **horizontal growth** (new pillars). The company has set a mid-term target for **2023-2027** aiming for a **15% revenue CAGR** (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and a **17% operating income CAGR**.
2.  **Long-Term Franchise Expansion:** The company is working on a PC-based MMORPG, **MapleStory N**, which is undergoing large-scale testing and is key to the *MapleStory* franchise's goal of a **14% revenue CAGR from 2023 to 2027**.
3.  **Western and Chinese Market Penetration:** New titles like **ARC Raiders** are positioned for global success, and a partnership with Tencent has secured an ISBN license for a Chinese adaptation of **THE FINALS**, opening up a huge potential market.
4.  **Capital Efficiency and Shareholder Return:** Management announced a new shareholder return policy, setting a minimum **Return on Equity (ROE) target of 10%** with the potential to grow as high as 15%, which is a long-term commitment to capital discipline.
5.  **New Pipeline Potential:** Successful early tests, like the Alpha test for **Vindictus: Defying Fate** being the most-played demo in the Steam Next Fest, suggest a promising future pipeline that can expand Nexon's international footprint.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of NEXON Co., Ltd.'s (NEXOF) corporate governance filings, executive compensation structure, and ownership concentration, the following points summarize the management incentives:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF)**

1.  **Compensation Structure is Highly Performance-Based:** The compensation for executive directors is structured into three main components: a fixed base salary, a performance-based annual bonus, and equity-based stock options.

2.  **Strong Emphasis on Variable Pay:** The CEO's total compensation shows a significant portion (approximately 82.7%) is comprised of performance-based bonuses, stock, and options, indicating a strong link between pay and business outcomes.

3.  **Incentives for Long-Term Value Creation:** The compensation plan includes **equity-based stock options** that are both time-based (exercisable over three years for retention) and **performance-based** (linked to mid-to-long-term business performance), which aligns management's interests with the sustainable growth of shareholder value.

4.  **Direct Management Ownership is Low:** The direct ownership stake held by individual insiders (managers and directors) is relatively low, typically around **2.15% to 2.16%** of the company. The CEO's direct share ownership is a minimal 0.071%.

5.  **Alignment is Enforced by a Controlling Shareholder:** The low direct managerial ownership is offset by a dominant controlling shareholder, **NXC Corporation**, the holding company owned by the founder's family, which holds a substantial stake (reported between 31.1% and 48.03%). This majority shareholder, representing the ultimate 'insider,' ensures their own long-term wealth is tied to the company's performance.

***

### **Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

*   **Management is incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, but alignment is primarily driven by the Compensation Structure and the Controlling Shareholder, not the direct stake of the operational management team.**
*   The high weighting toward variable pay and long-term equity ties the current executive team's financial success to company performance and stock price.
*   The large, centralized controlling stake by NXC Corporation means there is a powerful and permanent shareholder whose long-term financial interest is synonymous with the company's maximal value, creating a strong check on management for short-term personal gain.

## Price History

Based on the stock price and technical indicators for NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF), here is an analysis of its recent price history and market position.

*(Note: Data is based on the NEXON Co., Ltd. ADR, ticker **NEXOY**, which is closely related to the OTC ticker NEXOF.)*

### NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF) Price Analysis & Technical Snapshot

1.  **Current Position Relative to 52-Week Low:**
    The stock is currently trading approximately **$75.52\%$** above its 52-week low. [cite: 3 (from step 1)] Using the closing price of \$21.94 (as of Sep 26, 2025) against its 52-week low of \$12.50, the share price has seen a substantial recovery or climb over the past year. [cite: 3 (from step 1)]

2.  **Is the Stock Trading Low (Technical Analysis)?**
    The current technical picture is mixed, with a "neutral" overall technical rating, suggesting it is not definitively "trading low" or overbought. [cite: 1 (from step 1)] While Moving Averages currently show both short-term and long-term "sell signals," the one-week and one-month trends have recently been prevailing as a "buy" trend. [cite: 1 (from step 1), 3 (from step 1)]

3.  **Big Stock Jump from Acquisition Rumors:**
    In June 2025, the stock experienced a significant jump—in one instance, a 10% surge was reported—following a rumor that Tencent Holdings Ltd. was considering an acquisition. [cite: 4 (from step 1), 6] This volatility was short-lived, as Tencent subsequently denied the reports of an acquisition interest a few days later.

4.  **Significant Gains from Strong Earnings Performance:**
    The stock has seen major upward momentum, including a 25% share price surge over one month leading into May 2025, driven by robust quarterly reports. [cite: 10 (from step 1)] This performance was due to a successful rebound in key flagship franchises like *Dungeon&Fighter* and *MapleStory*. [cite: 4, 7, 8 (from step 2)]

5.  **Recent Financial Headwinds and FX Impact:**
    While Q2 2025 results (reported in August 2025) exceeded guidance for both revenue and operating income, the net income was below expectations. This disappointment was primarily due to a significant foreign exchange (FX) loss on its US dollar-denominated cash deposits.

---

## Long Thesis

NEXON is a financial powerhouse because it owns a handful of the world's most popular online games, like *MapleStory*, that have been generating stable, high-profit revenue for decades. These games are sustained by massive, loyal player communities who continuously spend small amounts on in-game items, creating a reliable cash flow. The bull case argues that management is now successfully using this dependable cash to achieve two goals: 1) Significantly boosting earnings by taking these classic hits and launching them on new platforms, specifically successful mobile versions in massive markets like China. 2) Investing heavily in new, globally appealing titles and studios (like *THE FINALS*) that will create entirely new, stable revenue pillars for the future. In the near term, massive stock buybacks will boost the stock price, while the successful launches of new games and mobile titles will drive high earnings growth for the next five years.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario assumes that management successfully executes its ambitious plan to launch seven new games by 2027 and that these new titles are commercially successful outside of Asia, particularly in Western markets. A second major assumption is that the company's core money-makers (like *Dungeon & Fighter*) maintain their huge player bases and high spending rates, especially avoiding adverse regulatory changes in crucial markets like China and South Korea regarding their microtransaction business model.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This bull case is overly optimistic and misrepresents the current financial and operational trends, particularly regarding the stability of core IP and the success of new IP expansion. The thesis correctly identifies the company's strategy but overlooks significant execution risks and early signs of failure in key growth areas.

### **Critique and Flaws in the NEXON Bull Thesis (Bear Case Pillars)**

#### **1. Instability and Over-Reliance on Legacy IP (The "Stable Cash Cow" Flaw)**

1.  **Core IP Volatility and Regulatory Risk:** The bull case's claim of "stable, high-profit revenue" is flawed, as core franchises have recently demonstrated significant volatility and regulatory vulnerability. The Korean PC version of *MapleStory* experienced a major sales slump following a fine from the Fair Trade Commission in 2024, forcing a rebound through significant content updates. Similarly, the PC version of *Dungeon & Fighter* in China faced a revenue downturn due to a fundamental imbalance in the in-game economy, resulting in missed sales targets.
2.  **China Over-Reliance and Decaying Mobile Revenue:** NEXON's financial health is dangerously concentrated, with China accounting for 38% of 2024 revenue, which the company explicitly flags as a risk. While the launch of *Dungeon & Fighter Mobile* in China was meteoric (surpassing $1 billion in six months), its revenue declined month-on-month after its initial peak, suggesting an unsustainable launch-boost effect rather than a new, stable growth pillar. The slower-than-expected growth from subsequent updates to the franchise indicates a struggle to sustain high engagement in this crucial market.
3.  **Broad Decline in PC Legacy Revenue:** Revenue declines in the crucial PC segment (down 18% YoY in Q3 2024) and declines in other major franchises like *MapleStory* and the *FC Franchise* (formerly *FIFA Online*) in 2024 indicate the core business is shrinking, which requires mobile launches to offset.

#### **2. Failure of New, Globally Appealing Titles (The "New Pillars" Flaw)**

1.  **Lack of Western Market Success and Retention:** The central argument that new titles will create "entirely new, stable revenue pillars" is already showing signs of failure. *THE FINALS*, a key global title, performed "below expectations" in the company's Q1 2025 earnings. Its concurrent player count on Steam dropped steeply from an all-time peak of over 242,000 at launch to around 20,000 or lower in 2024, indicating very poor long-term player retention in Western markets.
2.  **Failure of Other New IP:** Another new global release, *The First Descendant*, similarly failed to convert launch hype into a stable player base, with its average concurrent player count plummeting from approximately 200,000 at launch to about 9,000 later, forcing NEXON to label its performance as "below expectations". This calls into serious question the company's ability to execute its ambitious plan to launch seven new, commercially successful, global games by 2027.

#### **3. Weakening Financials and Distorted Earnings (The "Earnings Growth" Flaw)**

1.  **Operating Income Decline:** Despite record revenue in 2024, NEXON's operating income decreased by 8% year-over-year, which reflects the "ongoing investments" in new IP that have yet to pay off. This indicates that the core profit engine is less efficient or is being diluted by costly, underperforming new projects.
2.  **Net Income Distortion:** The high net income growth in 2024 was largely artificial, boosted by a significant foreign exchange gain on cash deposits and a non-recurring impairment charge from the prior year that did not repeat. This FX-driven boost masks a weaker underlying operating performance and cannot be relied upon for sustained "high earnings growth."

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for NEXON Co., Ltd. (NEXOF)**

The bull case's confidence in sustained earnings growth is misplaced due to an over-reliance on a few aging franchises that are showing signs of revenue volatility and a significant failure rate among the highly capitalized new IP intended for global expansion.

The bear case is that NEXON is a single-point-of-failure stock whose financial stability hinges disproportionately on the sustained performance of the high-risk *Dungeon & Fighter Mobile* in the politically and economically volatile Chinese market.

1.  **Core IP is Vulnerable, Not Stable:** The foundation of the company—its legacy IPs like *Dungeon & Fighter* and *MapleStory*—is proving to be highly vulnerable to in-game economic mismanagement, regulatory fines in Korea, and a lack of sustained user engagement in China, leading to missed targets and required re-investments to simply stabilize the base.
2.  **Global Expansion Strategy is Failing:** NEXON's critical and expensive strategy to establish new, global revenue pillars via new IP (*THE FINALS*, *The First Descendant*) is failing to secure long-term player retention in Western markets, leading to low revenue and the explicit designation of "below expectations" performance from management. The failure of these high-profile titles strongly suggests the company will fail to successfully execute its ambitious seven-game pipeline by 2027.
3.  **Organic Profitability is Declining:** The core operating income is decreasing despite record revenue, indicating that massive investments in new studios and IP are a drag on profitability and not yet generating a positive return, while one-time FX gains are masking underlying weakness in organic growth.
4.  **China Deceleration Risk:** The significant early success of *Dungeon & Fighter Mobile* in China is already showing signs of deceleration in player spending month-over-month post-launch, making the stock highly vulnerable to any further content missteps or adverse regulatory action from the Chinese government toward the microtransaction-heavy mobile model.

## Next Steps

The analysis is comprehensive, with a clear understanding of the Bull vs. Bear tension. The search has successfully quantified the financial targets (¥10B per new game), the shareholder return catalyst (¥25B ongoing buyback), the regulatory fine (11.6B won), and the severe *Dungeon & Fighter Mobile* revenue deceleration (down to 1/6th of its peak).

To provide the final, most impactful next steps for investigation, focus should shift to external validation and the long-term strategic shifts.

Here are the most important questions still left unanswered, structured for investigation:

### **Important Unanswered Questions for Further Investigation**

1.  **Quantifiable Long-Term Revenue Impact of Korean Regulation:**
    *   The **Korea FTC fine** and **MapleStory compensation** (totaling over 33.5 billion won) are known, and the "Cubes" accounted for ~30% of the game's revenue. **What was the precise *percentage drop* in *MapleStory*'s microtransaction revenue (or ARPU/ARPPU) in the quarters *immediately following* the 2021 probability disclosure mandate?** This is the ultimate test of whether transparent loot box odds sustainably kill the high-margin monetization model.

2.  **Long-Term Chinese Regulatory Risk and Adaptation:**
    *   China's proposed 2023 regulations aim to ban rewards for **daily log-ins and repeated spending**, and mandate **spending caps**. **What specific *operational changes* has NEXON (or its partner Tencent) been forced to implement in *Dungeon & Fighter Mobile* since the draft rules were announced, and have they published a forward-looking revenue model that accounts for the potential imposition of player spending caps?** This determines the long-term ceiling for the company's single most critical revenue driver.

3.  **New IP Strategic Shift and Market Acceptance (The *ARC Raiders* Bet):**
    *   NEXON's competitive moat is built on F2P Live Operations, yet **ARC Raiders** is confirmed to launch as a **premium-priced ($40)** extraction shooter. **What is the current, stated *sales volume* or *initial revenue target* for *ARC Raiders*?** Success in this non-F2P, Western-focused model is a vital test of whether the company can successfully diversify its creative and business strategy outside of its core F2P competency.

4.  **Executive Compensation and Long-Term IP Performance Alignment:**
    *   The CEO's pay is highly performance-based, but direct ownership is low. **Are the long-term equity incentives (stock options) for key development executives *specifically tied to the sustained retention or profitability of the new IP launches* (e.g., *THE FINALS*, *The First Descendant* in year 2 or 3), or are they based primarily on short-term franchise revenue growth and total company operating income?** Answering this would reveal if management's personal wealth is truly aligned with the difficult-to-achieve long-term "new pillar" strategy.
