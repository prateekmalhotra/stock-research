## Business Summary

WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc.'s core business model involves providing holographic Augmented Reality (AR) advertising and entertainment services, primarily targeting businesses (B2B) in mainland China. The company generates most of its revenue by helping advertisers and media agencies create and deploy interactive, three-dimensional advertisements, effectively selling proprietary software and technology solutions to these corporate customers. A smaller, but increasing portion of their income comes from developing holographic content, such as mobile applications and streaming services, and selling specialized semiconductor hardware necessary for holographic processing. Thus, the company heavily relies on Chinese corporate spending on innovative digital marketing.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk stems from the company's heavy reliance on discretionary advertising spending in the Chinese market. Should the local economy slow down, advertisers often cut their marketing budgets first, which directly and immediately shrinks WiMi's primary revenue source. This type of reduction in spending has occurred during past economic contractions, posing an ongoing concern for their stability. A key long-term risk is intense competition and technological obsolescence. WiMi operates in a field where technology evolves extremely fast, and larger, better-funded Chinese tech giants are also heavily investing in AR and VR solutions. If these major competitors introduce superior or cheaper technology, WiMi’s proprietary assets could quickly become outdated, severely harming its market position and earnings potential. Furthermore, operating exclusively in China exposes the company to sudden changes in regulatory policy regarding content, data, or technology licensing, which could abruptly limit their operations.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available public filings, primarily its status as a Foreign Private Issuer (FPI) filing a Form 20-F, the following points detail the management incentive and compensation structure for WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (WIMI).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Control (Dominant Factor)**

*   **High Control:** The Chairman, Jie Zhao, holds a controlling interest, which has historically been reported as approximately **78.5% to 82.6% of the total voting power** due to the company's dual-class share structure (Class A shares have 10 votes per share).
*   **Shareholder Alignment (Voting):** This extremely high concentration of voting power means that the Chairman, and thus the current management, has nearly complete control over all shareholder matters, including the election of directors and the approval of compensation plans, regardless of the votes of non-controlling shareholders.
*   **"Controlled Company" Status:** WIMI qualifies as a "controlled company" under Nasdaq rules, which allows it to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to protect minority shareholders in U.S. domestic companies.

#### **2. Compensation Structure**

*   **Equity-Based Incentives:** The compensation structure includes long-term incentives through equity-based awards, specifically mentioning both **Performance Restricted Share Awards (RSAs)** and time-vested RSAs under the company’s stock compensation plans.
*   **Performance Metrics Indicated:** The company's adoption of a Clawback Policy requires recovery of "Incentive-Based Compensation" based on "Financial Reporting Measure[s]" or other metrics like **stock price or Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** in the event of an accounting restatement, indicating that performance-based metrics are utilized.
*   **Variable Stock Compensation:** Stock-based compensation expenses were substantial in a prior fiscal year (RMB 55.7 million in 2023) but dropped to nil in the most recent fiscal year (2024), suggesting that the total compensation package is highly variable and dependent on equity grants.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

*   **Incentive to Act in the Controlling Shareholder's Interest:** The management team, particularly the Chairman, has a **very high incentive to act in their own interest** due to their overwhelming voting power and effective control of the company. The high voting stake itself aligns the Chairman's financial interests with a rising stock price, which benefits all shareholders, but his **control** means other shareholders have limited recourse or influence.
*   **Alignment with Shareholder Value (General):** The use of performance-based equity awards tied to financial reporting measures and stock price/TSR creates a structural alignment mechanism, as these awards are generally only valuable if the company's value increases.
*   **Risk of Pockets-Lining:** The FPI status and "controlled company" exemption result in less extensive and less timely public disclosure of individual executive pay compared to domestic U.S. issuers. This reduced transparency, coupled with highly concentrated voting control, creates an environment where incentive structures could potentially be weighted more towards the controlling group's interests than those of the minority public shareholders.

## Long Thesis

The bullish case for WiMi is based on its successful pivot from low-margin advertising services to becoming a crucial high-tech supplier for the future of digital infrastructure. In the near term, the company has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in profitability, moving past previous losses to massive net income growth (up 926% recently), indicating successful monetization of its specialized Augmented Reality (AR) technology and increasing financial stability. For the long term, WiMi is positioning itself to be an indispensable provider of foundational components for high-growth sectors. The company is investing heavily in cutting-edge, patented technologies—including holographic semiconductor chips, 3D sensing systems (LiDAR) for autonomous vehicles, and AR head-up displays (HUDs) for cars—which are essential building blocks for the Smart Vehicle and Metaverse ecosystems. By owning this specialized intellectual property and focusing on complex B2B solutions, WiMi transforms from a simple digital advertiser into a high-value technology platform with protected market niches and recurring revenue potential.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario assumes that WiMi can successfully execute and commercialize its ambitious research and development initiatives, particularly in holographic automotive technology (LiDAR and AR HUD) and advanced quantum computing integration, before larger, better-funded tech giants develop competing solutions. It also assumes that the Chinese corporate and automotive markets rapidly adopt these specialized, high-cost holographic AR systems. Finally, the bull case requires WiMi to maintain its strong financial momentum, sustaining recent profitability and expanding cash flow, while effectively using its vast intellectual property portfolio to defend its niche from competitors.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies major holes and faults in the long thesis for WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (WIMI), supported by recent financial disclosures and market data.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **The "Successful Pivot" Claim is Contradicted by Revenue Mix.** The thesis claims a pivot to high-tech supply (holographic chips, LiDAR); however, financial filings show that **100% of WiMi's 2024 revenue was derived from AR advertising services**, the very "low-margin" business the company is supposedly pivoting away from. The reported "Semiconductor Business" segment, which would house the high-tech B2B products, was discontinued in 2024.
2.  **Massive Profitability Growth is Driven by Declining Revenue.** The "dramatic improvement in profitability" (926% net income growth) is not indicative of business success as it coincides with a **significant, multi-year decline in total revenue**. This suggests the profit surge is primarily an unsustainable, low-quality earnings event resulting from aggressive cost-cutting, one-time gains, or changes in accounting for prior losses, not the successful monetization of new, high-value technology.
3.  **No Evidence of Commercialization for Core New Products.** The thesis's long-term reliance on foundational components like AR HUDs and LiDAR is undermined by the fact that the segment responsible for these products was effectively discontinued or contributes $0 to the company’s current revenue mix. Despite possessing patents, there is no disclosed evidence of high-volume B2B contracts with major Chinese automakers, which are the basis of the bull case.
4.  **Overstated Competitive Position and IP Protection.** The assumption that WiMi can be an "indispensable provider" with "protected market niches" is highly doubtful. The rapidly growing Chinese automotive LiDAR market is overwhelmingly dominated by a few major domestic players (e.g., Hesai, RoboSense, Huawei), which collectively control over 90% of the passenger car LiDAR market, leaving little room for a company whose dedicated segment has been discontinued.
5.  **Financial Instability and Corporate Governance Concerns.** Recent corporate actions, including a **20-for-1 reverse stock split** in 2025, suggest the company has faced significant challenges maintaining its stock price and listing compliance. Reverse splits often signal underlying weakness and can lead to immediate stock price volatility, contradicting the thesis's assumption of sustained financial momentum.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for WIMI

1.  **Low-Quality Earnings and Systemic Revenue Contraction:** The stock's perceived financial turnaround is a mirage. The reported net income surge is non-organic, masked by the significant, ongoing decline in top-line revenue, which has dropped consistently over the past several years. WiMi remains fundamentally a shrinking, low-margin AR advertising service provider.
2.  **The "Pivot to High-Tech" is Non-Existent and Failed:** The high-growth B2B segments touted by the bull case—holographic chips, LiDAR, and AR HUDs—have zero or negligible commercial traction; the dedicated **Semiconductor Business segment has been discontinued from revenue reporting**, shattering the narrative of a transformation into an "indispensable high-tech supplier."
3.  **High Competition in Core Target Markets:** WiMi's advanced products are effectively uncommercialized and face a Chinese Smart Vehicle market where the supposed "protected niches" are already saturated and controlled by a handful of established domestic tech and LiDAR giants, making meaningful market penetration an extreme long shot.
4.  **Significant Corporate and Liquidity Risk:** The combination of a multi-year revenue slide and recent extreme volatility (including a 20-for-1 reverse stock split) signals deep structural issues and capital market manipulation risks, which undermine any long-term valuation based on the company's stated technology potential.

---

## Next Steps

The initial investigation confirmed the most critical contradiction, which is the core of the Bear Case: **WiMi's management is touting a pivot to high-tech manufacturing, but its financials show it is a shrinking AR advertising company.**

Here are the next important questions and steps to investigate further, focusing on the quality of the recent profitability and the lack of high-tech revenue:

### Next Steps and Important Unanswered Questions

1.  **Deconstruct the Profitability Surge (The "Mirage" Check)**
    *   What are the specific line items (e.g., gain on assets, change in fair value, or a massive drop in operating expenses) that drove the approximately **RMB 613.7 million swing** from a net loss in 2023 to a net income in 2024? This will determine if the profit is sustainable or non-recurring.
    *   Specifically investigate the **"Other Income"** or **"Total Non-Operating Income/Expense"** section of the latest income statement (FY 2024 and H1 2025) to identify any major, non-core one-time gains.

2.  **Verify Commercialization of "Next-Gen" Technologies**
    *   Given that the latest financial report states **100% of 2024 revenue was from AR advertising services** and the semiconductor segment was discontinued, is there any credible, third-party evidence (outside of WiMi's own press releases) of major B2B contract wins for their LiDAR, AR HUD, or quantum computing solutions?
    *   Search for **Form 6-K filings** (current reports) in late 2024 and 2025 related to any *new* business segment formation or a material change in revenue breakdown, as the stated strategy contradicts the reported revenue.

3.  **Analyze the Revenue and Balance Sheet Discrepancies**
    *   Why has revenue continued to decline year-over-year (RMB 585.4M in 2023 to RMB 541.9M in 2024), while the company touts "climbing demand for holographic solutions?"
    *   Where did the massive **RMB 1.14 billion increase in cash and short-term investments** (up 148% in 2024) come from, especially given the continuous operating revenue decline? Check the cash flow statement for financing activities (e.g., debt or equity issuance).

4.  **Evaluate Current Valuation vs. Peers**
    *   Calculate WIMI's current **Price-to-Sales (P/S)** and **Price-to-Earnings (P/E)** ratios based on the latest 2024/2025 financials, and compare them to Chinese-listed AR companies (e.g., Kuaishou, SenseTime) and LiDAR pure-plays (e.g., Hesai Technology, RoboSense).

5.  **Assess Market Impact of Corporate Actions**
    *   Determine the stock's performance trend and volume changes immediately following the **1-for-20 reverse stock split** in April 2025, which often impacts retail investor sentiment and institutional compliance.
