## Business Summary

The Walt Disney Company’s business model is built around creating highly valuable stories and characters (known as intellectual property) and exploiting them across four main integrated business segments. If a new movie succeeds, that success is leveraged into theme park rides, consumer merchandise, television shows, and streaming content, maximizing profits from a single creation. This synergistic model generates revenue primarily through two channels: selling access to content (via global streaming services like Disney+ and traditional television networks like ESPN and ABC) and selling experiences and products (through theme parks, resorts, cruises, and licensing merchandise). Disney’s customer base is global, spanning all demographics, but heavily relies on family and fan discretionary spending, primarily operating as a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) enterprise.

## Business Model Risk

Near-term risks primarily revolve around macroeconomic pressures and the profitability of its streaming service. A global economic downturn directly harms Disney, as consumers reduce spending on high-cost, discretionary items like theme park visits, resort stays, and cruise tickets. Furthermore, the pivot from its highly profitable traditional cable TV networks to direct-to-consumer streaming (like Disney+) is expensive; if the company fails to generate steady subscriber growth or if it cannot control the high cost of content creation, it will continue to lose money in this crucial segment, harming near-term earnings stability. Long-term risks include franchise failure and technological disruption. If a string of major cinematic releases (such as Marvel or Star Wars films) fails to resonate with audiences, the entire synergistic machine slows down, as there is no fresh IP to feed the parks and merchandise divisions. Historically, Disney has faced creative slumps (prior to acquiring Pixar and Marvel), but the current concern is that the speed of cord-cutting (audiences abandoning traditional cable) threatens its legacy television revenue much faster than anticipated, forcing management to invest billions into streaming just to maintain market position while simultaneously managing intense competition from established rivals like Netflix and emerging tech players.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on The Walt Disney Company, starting from its beginning to its present-day operations.

---

### **The Founding and Early Vision (1923–1937)**

1.  **Inception:** The Walt Disney Company was officially founded on October 16, 1923, by two brothers, Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney, and was initially called the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio.
2.  **The "Why" It Was Founded:** Walt Disney, an ambitious cartoonist, sought to create high-quality animated short films for the cinema after his previous studio, Laugh-O-Gram, went bankrupt.
3.  **Core Goal:** A key founding principle, especially after an early financial problem, was to ensure the Disney studio always owned the rights to its own creative characters, which would be essential for future growth and merchandising.
4.  **Early Headwind (Problem):** Walt lost the rights to one of his first popular characters, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, to a distributor who hired away his animators, teaching him a painful lesson about creative ownership.
5.  **Innovative Solution:** This loss immediately spurred the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928; the studio made sure to keep all creative control over this new character.
6.  **Key Innovation:** In 1928, the short film *Steamboat Willie* was released, introducing Mickey Mouse and becoming the first cartoon to successfully use synchronized sound, making it a revolutionary moment in the film industry.
7.  **The First Major Risk:** In 1937, Walt Disney took a massive financial risk by producing *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, the world's first full-length animated feature film, which critics skeptically nicknamed "Disney's Folly."
8.  **The First Big Tailwind (Success):** *Snow White* was a spectacular hit, becoming the highest-grossing film of its time and securing the studio's financial future, proving that audiences would pay to see a long animated story.

### **Growth, Diversification, and Challenges (1940s–1984)**

9.  **Wartime Headwind and Solution:** During the early 1940s, the company faced severe financial problems, partly due to World War II closing foreign markets; the successful re-release of *Snow White* in 1944 provided much-needed revenue.
10. **Post-War Diversification:** In the 1950s, Disney strategically expanded beyond films into new media, embracing television with popular shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club* and *Zorro*, which helped promote their films and characters.
11. **Major Innovative Leap:** In 1955, Walt Disney opened Disneyland in California, fulfilling his desire to create a clean, immersive amusement park where parents and children could have fun together.
12. **The Post-Walt Headwind:** Following Walt Disney's death in 1966, and his brother Roy O. Disney’s death in 1971, the company's creative direction struggled, and profits, especially in animation, began to decline for many years.

### **The Corporate Turnaround and Acquisition Era (1984–Present)**

13. **Headwind of Decline:** By the mid-1980s, the company was vulnerable to corporate takeover attempts due to its low stock price and struggling animation output.
14. **Turnaround Solution and Tailwind:** A new leadership team began the "Disney Renaissance" (1989–1999) with blockbuster animated films like *The Little Mermaid*, *Beauty and the Beast*, and *The Lion King*, which revitalized the animation studio and made Disney a global powerhouse again.
15. **Strategic Expansion Tailwind (IP Acquisition):** Beginning in 2006, under CEO Bob Iger, Disney began a series of game-changing acquisitions to secure valuable character and story libraries, including Pixar (2006), Marvel Entertainment (2009), and Lucasfilm (2012).
16. **Modern Headwind (Cord-Cutting):** In the 2010s, Disney's profitable cable television networks, particularly ESPN, faced a severe headwind as many consumers began "cutting the cord," abandoning traditional cable for streaming services.
17. **Modern Innovative Solution:** In response to the streaming headwind, Disney launched its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney+, in 2019, leveraging its vast library of acquired and original content to compete directly with companies like Netflix.
18. **Recent Headwinds:** The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant problems by temporarily forcing the closure of theme parks and resorts worldwide, one of the company's largest revenue sources.
19. **Present-Day Goal:** The Walt Disney Company's goal remains to be the world's leading family entertainment company, focusing on innovative storytelling and leveraging its content across four major areas: Studio Entertainment (films), Media Networks (TV), Parks and Resorts, and Direct-to-Consumer (streaming).

## Moat Analysis

The Walt Disney Company's (DIS) strength, or "moat," is built on a powerful, decades-long cycle where one successful part of the business reinforces all the others, making it incredibly hard for competitors to match.

## Analysis of The Walt Disney Company's Moat

### 1. The Power of Integrated Intellectual Property (IP)

*   **Vast, Treasured IP Library:** Disney owns the world's most recognizable collection of characters and franchises—including Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar—that appeal across multiple generations.
*   **The Content-to-Experience Ecosystem:** A successful new movie (content) immediately drives interest and revenue across four distinct businesses: it boosts subscriptions on Disney+ (streaming), increases ticket sales and guest spending at theme parks (experiences), sells licensed merchandise (products), and feeds its television channels (networks). This virtuous cycle is Disney's unique competitive advantage.
*   **Unique Differentiation:** No other company can offer the same integrated experience of watching a new Marvel series, then meeting that character at a themed land, and finally buying their branded toy; this is what truly sets Disney apart from a streaming rival like Netflix or a theme park rival like Six Flags.

### 2. Pricing Power and Market Position

*   **Special Position in Experiences:** Disney holds a leadership position in the theme park and resorts industry, which, combined with high demand, gives it strong and sustainable pricing power to consistently raise ticket and resort prices.
*   **Premium Pricing for Unique Content:** For its streaming services like Disney+, the exclusivity of the content—it's the *only* place to watch new Marvel or Star Wars shows—helps it maintain pricing power even in a competitive market, allowing for price hikes without triggering massive customer loss.
*   **Economies of Scale:** As a massive global conglomerate, Disney benefits from economies of scale in content production and marketing, which allows it to invest heavily in high-quality projects and reach audiences worldwide at a lower relative cost per customer than smaller competitors.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

*   **Sticky & Recurring Revenue:** Disney's business is built on recurring revenue across multiple segments:
    *   **Subscriptions:** The Direct-to-Consumer services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) provide predictable, monthly subscription income.
    *   **Loyalty in Parks:** The deep emotional brand loyalty fostered by its characters and parks ensures high repeat visits and strong customer retention for its Experiences segment.
    *   **Deferred Revenue:** Advance ticket sales and multi-day passes for theme parks are paid upfront, meaning the company has money in hand before the service is even delivered, which is a very sticky form of revenue.

### 4. Barriers to Displacement (How Hard is it to be Displaced?)

*   **Incredibly High Capital Costs:** It is extremely difficult to displace Disney, even for a company with more capital. The sheer cost and time required to build and operate world-class global theme parks, acquire/develop a comparable vault of irreplaceable IP, and establish a global distribution network are astronomical.
*   **Time-Tested Brand Trust:** The Disney brand, which is one of the most recognizable and respected globally, has been built over nearly a century of consistent, family-friendly storytelling—a reputation and level of customer trust that cannot be bought or quickly replicated.
*   **Protecting the Moat:** The company has been zealous throughout its history in protecting its intellectual property, which involves significant legal and lobbying efforts to extend and enforce copyright protection.

### 5. Innovation and Network Effects

*   **R&D and Constant Innovation:** Disney does invest heavily in innovation, particularly in its Parks and Experiences segment through **Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development**, which constantly introduces new, technologically enhanced rides and immersive experiences to keep the parks fresh and maintain their competitive edge.
*   **Necessity for Content Edge:** While the brand is timeless, the *content* must constantly innovate. To maintain the moat, the company must continue to produce high-quality, hit films and shows (e.g., new Star Wars and Marvel content) to feed the entire ecosystem and justify the price for its streaming and park offerings.
*   **Network Effects as Synergy:** The core of Disney's moat is a network effect that goes beyond the typical *user-to-user* model. It is a powerful *business-to-business* network effect where success in one area (e.g., a movie) increases the value and demand for all its other, diversified business segments (parks, merchandise, streaming).

## Catalyst Analysis

The Walt Disney Company (DIS) has several key catalysts that are likely to drive its stock price in the near and long term, primarily focused on its streaming segment achieving profitability, major park expansions, and increased capital returns to shareholders.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Streaming Profitability and Consolidation:** Disney's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming segment has achieved a significant milestone by becoming profitable, which reverses a multi-billion dollar loss trend from previous years. \ Management is focused on continued margin expansion and has outlined three pillars for streaming growth: platform integration, technological improvements (like paid sharing and ad-tech), and strategic content investment. \
2.  **Launch of ESPN Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Offering:** The separate launch of a standalone ESPN streaming offering in August 2025, which will include the full suite of ESPN networks and services, aims to secure its position as the preeminent digital sports platform and provides a new high-value bundling opportunity for subscribers with Disney+ and Hulu. \
3.  **Increased Capital Return to Shareholders:** The company has increased its semi-annual cash dividend (including a recent 33% increase to \$1.00 per share) and approved a \$3 billion share repurchase program, signaling improved financial health and a focus on rewarding shareholders. \
4.  **Cost Savings Exceeding Expectations:** Disney raised its target for annualized cost savings to "exceed" its previously set goal of \$7.5 billion, which directly improves operating margins and profitability across the company. \

### Long-Term Catalysts (3+ Years)

1.  **Massive Investment in Experiences Segment:** The company is accelerating and expanding its investment in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment, planning to spend approximately \$60 billion over 10 years on park expansions, cruise line capacity, and resorts globally. \ This substantial investment in physical assets leverages Disney’s intellectual property to secure long-term revenue and competitive advantage. \
2.  **Cruise Line Expansion:** The Disney Cruise Line is poised to be a significant growth driver for the Experiences segment over the next 3 to 4 years, with two new ships launching soon (including a large new ship homeported in Asia) to nearly double capacity worldwide. \
3.  **Unified Streaming Ecosystem:** The full integration of Hulu into Disney+ by 2026 will create a simplified and more powerful streaming platform, which management believes will lead to expected benefits like increased engagement, lower subscriber churn, and higher advertising revenue potential. \
4.  **Strategic IP and Franchise Management:** The success of recent films and franchises, such as the live-action *Lilo & Stitch* crossing \$1 billion at the box office, demonstrates the "flywheel" effect, where successful content drives downstream revenue across consumer products, parks, and other businesses. \ Management is deliberately shifting the content strategy to prioritize quality over volume to ensure the success of its core franchises. \
5.  **Gaming and Digital Partnerships:** A \$1.5 billion equity investment in Epic Games, the creators of *Fortnite*, aims to create a new, persistent game and entertainment universe that will leverage Disney's vast library of characters and stories, tapping into the lucrative video gaming market. \

### Management Commentary on Strategy (From Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **CEO Bob Iger** stated that Disney is "operating from a position of strength and building across our company with a continued focus on quality and innovation, leveraging our integrated businesses to create value in a way that is unique to Disney." \
*   **On Streaming (DTC):** Iger is optimistic on the ability to "turn the streaming business into a true growth business" and highlighted the strategic plan to combine Hulu and Disney+ into a unified app experience for better bundling and technological leverage. \
*   **On Experiences:** Iger reiterated the plan to invest significantly to "turbocharge" existing businesses through expansion and enhancement of domestic parks, stating that the new additions will make Disney's experiences "very accessible to hundreds of millions of more people than we were in the past." \
*   **On Content:** Management is focused on the "renewed momentum" in film studios and the "continued emergence of popular new franchises" to generate long-term value across all segments. \

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of The Walt Disney Company's (DIS) 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) and related filings, the following points address the management's incentives and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (Based on 2024 Proxy Data)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

*   **Low Collective Ownership Percentage:** The aggregate beneficial ownership of the company's common stock held by all Directors and Executive Officers as a group is noted as **less than 1%** of the outstanding shares. For a major, widely-held company like Disney, this low percentage is typical and not a significant negative factor in isolation.
*   **Strong Holding Requirements:** Executive Officers (NEOs) must comply with substantial stock ownership guidelines, requiring the CEO to hold shares equivalent to **five times his base salary** and other NEOs to hold three times their base salary within five years of their appointment.
*   **High CEO Stock Alignment:** CEO Bob Iger demonstrates significant personal investment, holding equity valued at **over 27 times his base salary**, far exceeding the mandatory five-time minimum. This high holding indicates a strong financial alignment with long-term stock performance.

#### **2. Compensation Structure ("Pay-for-Performance")**

*   **Highly Variable Compensation:** The compensation structure is heavily weighted toward variable, performance-based pay. For the CEO, **97% of total target compensation is "at risk,"** and for other Named Executive Officers (NEOs), **85% is "at risk."**
*   **Long-Term Equity Mix:** The majority of the long-term incentive grants are tied to future performance and stock price:
    *   **CEO (Bob Iger):** The long-term equity mix is **60% Performance-Based Units (PBUs)** and **40% Stock Options**.
    *   **Other NEOs:** The mix is **50% PBUs**, **25% Time-Based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**, and **25% Stock Options**. The high PBU weighting strongly favors long-term, sustained results.

#### **3. Performance Metrics and Shareholder Alignment**

*   **Annual Incentive Metrics (Short-Term):** The annual cash bonus plan focuses on key quantitative financial metrics for the year, including **Adjusted Revenue**, **Adjusted Total Segment Operating Income**, and **Adjusted After-Tax Free Cash Flow**, along with qualitative strategic objectives.
*   **Long-Term Incentive Metrics (PBUs):** The vesting of PBUs (Performance-Based Units) is tied to multi-year performance, specifically including the use of **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** and a **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** test. To achieve the target PBU payout, the company's TSR must be at the **55th percentile** of the S&P 500 companies.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The Compensation Committee has increased the rigor of the performance requirements, noting that prior performance-based awards were forfeited when the TSR was below the threshold, demonstrating a functioning "pay-for-performance" mechanism.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

The management of The Walt Disney Company is **incentivized to act strongly in the interest of the shareholders,** primarily due to the design of its compensation plan.

*   The fact that **97% of the CEO's and 85% of other NEOs' target compensation is "at risk"** and dependent on financial and stock price performance ensures their wealth creation is inextricably linked to shareholder returns.
*   The use of **Relative TSR** and **ROIC** as primary long-term PBU metrics forces management to achieve results that are better than their competitors and generate efficient returns on capital, which directly benefits shareholders.
*   The **high personal stock holding of the CEO (over 27x salary)** and the strict stock ownership guidelines across the executive team create a significant personal stake in the company's long-term stock value, disincentivizing short-term, self-serving actions.

## Price History

Based on current financial data and recent market movements for The Walt Disney Company (DIS), here is an analysis of its price history and technical status.

---

### **The Walt Disney Company (DIS) Price History Analysis**

1.  **Current Position Relative to Low:** The Walt Disney Company stock closed recently around \$114.78 and is currently trading approximately **43.30%** above its 52-week low of \$80.10, which was hit around April 2025.
2.  **52-Week Range:** The stock's price is in the upper part of its 52-week range, with a 52-week high of \$124.69, suggesting it is **not** currently trading low in historical context over the past year.
3.  **Technical Analysis Status (Trading Low?):** Technical indicators show a mixed picture, generally indicating a **neutral to bullish bias** after a significant rally. The stock is currently consolidating, sitting below near-term resistance (around \$118–\$121) but above a major long-term support zone, suggesting it is positioning for a potential range breakout rather than trading at a technical "low."

### **Explanation of Recent Big Price Movements**

4.  **Significant Recent Rise ("Up Bigly"):** The stock experienced a major surge, particularly after hitting its 52-week low in April 2025, largely driven by the **Q2 Fiscal 2025 Earnings Report** released in early May 2025.
5.  **Earnings Beat and Guidance:** The stock jumped sharply (e.g., 9.66% pre-market) because the company significantly exceeded analyst expectations for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, and notably raised its full-year EPS guidance.
6.  **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Profitability:** A key driver of investor confidence was the strong performance of the Direct-to-Consumer segment (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+), which showed a significant increase in operating income and demonstrated improved profitability.
7.  **Theme Parks & Share Buybacks:** The "Experiences" segment (theme parks and cruises) continued to deliver robust operating income growth, and a commitment to returning value to shareholders via share repurchases further fueled the rally.

---

## Long Thesis

The stock will rise because Disney has successfully fixed its costly streaming division (Disney+), turning it into a profitable growth engine. This stability allows the company to focus on its high-margin crown jewel: the Parks and Experiences business. Management is investing $60 billion over the next decade to massively expand theme parks and cruise lines globally, capitalizing on the demand for unique, high-cost experiences. Disney’s unique advantage lies in its powerful 'flywheel'—its unmatched collection of franchises (Marvel, Star Wars) constantly creates new content that boosts subscriptions, drives demand for expensive theme park visits, and sells merchandise, creating a resilient and highly profitable ecosystem that no competitor can match.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This positive scenario requires that global consumers maintain healthy spending levels on discretionary items like vacations and theme park tickets. Furthermore, Disney must consistently produce successful new movies and television shows to keep its critical franchises (like Marvel and Star Wars) relevant and feed the demand for the parks and merchandise divisions. Finally, the massive $60 billion capital investment planned for park expansions must deliver strong returns on invested capital.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This long thesis contains several significant risks and assumptions that are being challenged by recent market data and company performance. The primary flaws revolve around the durability of the streaming profit, the immediate health of the parks business, and a potential "franchise fatigue" that threatens the entire "flywheel."

## Critique of the Long Thesis (Holes and Faults)

1.  **Streaming Profitability is Fragile and Driven by Price Hikes, Not Just Growth:** While the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) has recently achieved combined operating profitability, this milestone is heavily dependent on successive annual price increases and aggressive cost management, which has, in turn, sparked concerns about subscriber churn. It is not yet a demonstrably stable, self-sustaining "profitable growth engine."
2.  **The "Crown Jewel" Parks Business is Moderating Sooner Than Expected:** The thesis assumes a focus on the high-margin Parks segment is immediately stabilizing. However, Disney management has reported "demand moderation" and "softness" in the domestic theme parks, with operating income for U.S. parks sliding in a recent quarter. This suggests the market for high-cost experiences is already becoming sensitive to "recent economic uncertainty."
3.  **Core Assumption on Consumer Spending is Contradicted by Data:** The thesis's main assumption—that global consumers maintain healthy spending on discretionary items like vacations—is directly challenged by Disney's own comments that lower-income consumers are "feeling stress" and higher-income consumers are shifting spending to international travel, impacting domestic park attendance.
4.  **$60 Billion Investment Faces Competition and Timing Risk:** The massive $60 billion capital investment over the next decade will be a significant drain on free cash flow in the near-term. Its return-on-invested-capital (ROIC) is not guaranteed, especially as it faces significant new competition, such as Universal's Epic Universe, and is being deployed during a period of softening domestic demand.
5.  **The "Flywheel" is Spinning Slower Due to Content Quality and Franchise Fatigue:** The engine of the "flywheel"—consistently successful content from Marvel and Star Wars—is currently sputtering. CEO Bob Iger has admitted the focus on volume for streaming led to a decline in quality, and recent Marvel and Star Wars theatrical releases and TV series have disappointed critically and commercially, raising significant concerns about franchise fatigue and the ability of new content to boost subscriptions and theme park demand.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for The Walt Disney Company (DIS)

The stock faces downside pressure because its two key growth drivers are vulnerable: the high-margin Parks business is seeing domestic demand soften due to macroeconomic pressures, and the creative engine that powers the entire ecosystem—Marvel and Star Wars—is showing signs of significant franchise fatigue.

1.  **Deteriorating Core Profitability and High Capital Demand:** The critical Parks and Experiences segment, which historically provides the company's highest operating margins and a large percentage of its profit, is showing signs of weakening demand, especially in the domestic market. This decline in performance is ill-timed with the company's commitment to a massive $60 billion capital expenditure plan, which will weigh heavily on free cash flow and increase risk if consumer spending continues to slow.
2.  **Eroding Intellectual Property (IP) Value:** The central competitive advantage—the "flywheel" of IP—is at risk due to a perceived decline in the creative quality of tentpole franchises like Marvel and Star Wars. If new content continues to underperform, it will not only fail to drive streaming subscriptions and box office but will also devalue the core assets that the $60 billion park expansion is intended to leverage, leading to poor returns on that major investment.
3.  **Unsustainable Streaming Turnaround:** While the streaming segment is now technically profitable, this milestone relies heavily on price increases that are already leading to subscriber churn and are not indicative of robust organic growth. The platform's ability to maintain profitability while reining in content spending and fending off price-sensitive subscribers remains a key uncertainty.

## Next Steps

The analysis you have completed provides a strong, comprehensive, and well-structured foundation for evaluating The Walt Disney Company (DIS). You have successfully identified the company's core strengths (the "flywheel" and IP moat), key catalysts (streaming profit, \$60B capex), and the most critical risks (franchise fatigue, parks moderation, high debt).

The next logical steps should be to shift from qualitative business analysis to **quantitative valuation** and to gather deeper, actionable data on the specific financial execution of the two largest moving parts: the \$60 billion capex plan and the ESPN direct-to-consumer (DTC) pivot.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further:

### **Phase 1: Financial Health and Valuation**

1.  **Valuation Ratios and Peer Comparison:** Determine if the stock is cheap, fair, or expensive based on key multiples. Your analysis lacks the context of valuation.
    *   **Question to Ask:** How does Disney's current **P/E (17.83x TTM)** and **EV/EBITDA (13.63x TTM)** compare to its historical median and to direct competitors like Netflix, Universal (Comcast), and cruise lines?
    *   *Search Result Note:* The current TTM P/E is about **17.83x** and the EV/EBITDA is around **13.63x** (as of September 2025), which is below its 10-year median of 15.54x for EV/EBITDA.
2.  **Capital Structure and Debt Management:** Quantify the debt that the large capital expenditure (capex) plan and acquisitions have created.
    *   **Question to Ask:** What is the company's current **Net Debt** position and its **Debt/EBITDA** ratio? Is the company's balance sheet healthy enough to comfortably finance the massive \$60 billion capex program without significant risk?
    *   *Search Result Note:* Disney has a significant amount of debt, with a reported net debt position of approximately **-\$36.9 billion** and a Debt/EBITDA ratio of around **2.02**.
3.  **Return on Capital (ROIC):** The compensation plan ties executive bonuses to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), making this a critical metric.
    *   **Question to Ask:** What is Disney's current **ROIC** (reported at **5.78%**), and how does management expect the \$60 billion Experiences investment to specifically raise this number?

### **Phase 2: Deep Dive into Parks (\$60 Billion Execution)**

4.  **Specific Allocation of the \$60 Billion Capex:** The bear case flags this massive investment as a near-term drain; you need to know the specifics to judge the risk and return.
    *   **Question to Ask:** Where exactly is the \$60 billion being spent? According to SEC filings, **50%** is for **Parks and Resorts**, **20%** for **Cruise/Other**, and **30%** for **Tech & Maintenance**, with 70% earmarked for "capacity-expanding" investments globally. Where are the announced *new lands* or *major projects* that will drive future revenue?
5.  **Competitive Threat to Parks:** Quantify the long-term threat from competitors, specifically Universal's new park.
    *   **Question to Ask:** What is the financial and operational impact of Universal's (Comcast's) **Epic Universe** opening in Orlando, and how does Disney's counter-investment (e.g., at Disney World) specifically mitigate that competitive pressure?

### **Phase 3: Franchise Health and Content Pipeline**

6.  **Quantifying Franchise Fatigue (Content Funnel):** The "flywheel" only works if the IP is successful. The bear case about franchise fatigue is strongly supported by recent data.
