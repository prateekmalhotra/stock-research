## Business Summary

MSCI operates primarily as a global data and intellectual property licensing company, serving institutional clients such as asset managers, banks, and pension funds. Its core function is creating and licensing financial market indexes, which serve as the definitive blueprints for popular investment products like passively managed funds (ETFs). The company earns high-margin, recurring revenue through annual subscriptions for these index licenses, specialized software used for portfolio risk analysis, and rapidly growing subscriptions for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data and ratings. The revenue base is B2B (business-to-business), highly concentrated among sophisticated financial institutions in major financial centers like the U.S. and Europe.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the high dependence on global equity markets. Because a substantial portion of the Index revenue is tied to the value of Assets Under Management (AUM) tracking their indexes, any severe, sustained market downturn immediately reduces their earnings, a threat that materialized during crises like the 2008 financial collapse. Long-term risks include intensified competition from rivals like S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell, who could potentially undercut pricing or develop superior indexes, threatening MSCI's market position. Furthermore, the business relies heavily on the continued global trend toward passive investing. If regulatory shifts or a major change in investor preference slow or reverse the growth of index-tracking funds, it would significantly jeopardize MSCI's expansion trajectory.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of MSCI Inc., explained in simple, jargon-free English.

***

### The History of MSCI Inc. (Morgan Stanley Capital International)

#### The Founding and Core Purpose

1.  **Inception:** The core idea for MSCI began in **1969** with a company called Capital International, which published some of the first global stock market indexes to measure non-U.S. markets.
2.  **Official Branding:** The name MSCI was formally created in **1986** when investment bank **Morgan Stanley** licensed the rights to these international indexes and combined them with its name: **Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)**.
3.  **Why It Was Founded:** The company was founded to solve a major problem for investors: how to accurately measure and compare the performance of investments across different global markets. Its primary goal was to provide a standard, reliable yardstick (an index) for global investment portfolios, helping fund managers and institutional investors make better decisions.
4.  **Today's Goal:** MSCI's modern goal is to be the premier provider of "critical decision support tools" for the global investment community, helping clients understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return to confidently build effective investment portfolios.

#### Innovative Solutions and Key Milestones

5.  **Becoming Independent (2007-2009):** The company was originally a division of Morgan Stanley, but it was spun off in 2007 with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and became a fully independent, publicly traded company by 2009.
6.  **Solving the Risk Puzzle (The Barra Acquisition):** Recognizing that investors needed more than just performance measurement, MSCI made a major move in 2004 by acquiring a risk management and analytics firm called **Barra**. This merger allowed MSCI to offer sophisticated software that helped investors model and understand the potential risks in their portfolios, a vital innovative solution.
7.  **A Stable Business Model:** A key innovation in its business structure is relying on a recurring revenue model. Clients pay subscription fees for the analytics software and data, and they also pay fees based on the total value of assets that track MSCI's indexes, providing stable, predictable income even if markets are volatile.

#### Tailwinds: What Gave the Company a Boost

8.  **The Boom of Passive Investing:** The single biggest boost (tailwind) for MSCI has been the explosive growth of **passive investing**, especially Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and index funds, over the past few decades.
9.  **The Index Licensing Engine:** Since index funds are designed to simply mirror the performance of a specific index (like the MSCI World Index), they must license that index from MSCI. As more money flows into these funds, MSCI earns higher fees, because the fee is tied to the massive value of the assets under management (AUM) that track their indexes.
10. **The Rise of Sustainable Investing (ESG):** More recently, the growing global focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in investing has become a massive tailwind. MSCI was early to invest in and acquire ESG data providers, positioning itself as a leading source for ESG indexes and ratings.

#### Headwinds: Problems and Challenges

11. **Market Downturns and Volatility:** While the subscription fees provide stability, a portion of MSCI's revenue is tied to the total value of the assets tracking its indexes. When the stock market faces major downturns (like the dot-com bubble or financial crises), this value drops, creating a headwind that reduces the fee income from these funds.
12. **Competition:** MSCI operates in a competitive field, with major rivals like S&P Global and FTSE Russell also providing widely used market indexes. To deal with this, MSCI constantly works to improve its indexes and expand into new, specialized areas like climate and private assets, to maintain its dominant position.
13. **Recent Operational Challenges (Present Day):** The company has recently faced scrutiny (a headwind) regarding its internal operations, with a significant drop in profit being linked to rising operating expenses, including high employee compensation costs. These internal issues required management to justify their spending and deal with investor uncertainty.
14. **Client Budget Tightening:** In times of broad economic uncertainty, institutional clients may reduce their spending on financial data and risk management software. This presents an ongoing headwind that the company mitigates by proving its data and tools are *essential* for managing risk, not just a luxury.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of MSCI Inc. is one of the strongest in the financial world, rooted in a powerful combination of **Intangible Assets** (brand trust and standardization) and extremely high **Switching Costs**, which grant it a special, defensible market position.

### **The Moat and Market Position**

1.  **Standardization and Brand Trust (Intangible Asset):** MSCI is the industry's "gold standard" for measuring global stock market performance, particularly in international and emerging markets, a position it secured through early leadership. This trusted brand is why trillions of dollars in assets, including the vast majority of the world's largest investment funds, are benchmarked to MSCI indexes, making it a "must-have" product.
2.  **Special Position: Deep Market Embedment:** Its indexes are not just theoretical benchmarks; they are the foundation for over $16.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), including numerous ETFs and futures/options contracts. This deep embedment makes it an integral part of the global financial system's plumbing.
3.  **High Barriers to Entry:** Competitors like S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell exist, but they face an immense hurdle because a new index provider would need to convince nearly the entire institutional investor base to abandon the current global standard and pay the costs to switch all their funds and risk systems.

### **Pricing Power and Customer Stickiness**

1.  **Exceptional Pricing Power:** The combination of a dominant market position and high customer switching costs gives MSCI exceptional pricing power. It can consistently raise subscription fees because the cost of changing an index (updating prospectuses, re-coding risk models, retraining staff) often outweighs the cost of a price increase.
2.  **Sticky and Recurring Revenue:** MSCI’s revenue is remarkably stable, with approximately **98%** classified as recurring (subscription-based or asset-based fees). The nature of the contracts is highly sticky, demonstrated by a consistent customer retention rate in the **93% to 95%** range.

### **Difference from Competitors and Displacement**

1.  **Network Effects are the Key Differentiator:** The more widely an MSCI index is used by asset managers for benchmarking, the more attractive that index becomes to other investors, exchanges, and financial product creators. This creates a powerful **indirect network effect** where the utility of the product increases with the number of users, making it incredibly hard to displace.
2.  **The Dominant Standard:** While its primary competitors also have strong index businesses, MSCI's particular dominance in the international and emerging markets space, and its successful diversification into related products (Analytics, ESG, Climate), makes its entire ecosystem more comprehensive and integrated.
3.  **Hard to Displace with Capital Alone:** The business cannot be easily displaced by a competitor with more capital alone. The "moat" is based on **trust and inertia**, not just superior technology or lower price. The company even grew significantly after losing Vanguard, a major client, over a decade ago, proving the resilience of its brand and its value to the wider market.

### **Building and Sustaining the Moat (Innovation and R&D)**

1.  **Historical Reason for Growth:** The initial massive growth was driven by being a **first-mover** in providing standardized, independent, and high-quality international indexes, such as the Emerging Markets Index, when global investing started to take off decades ago.
2.  **Ensuring a Solid Moat (Constant Innovation):** To defend this moat, MSCI constantly innovates by creating new standards in high-growth areas, requiring significant intellectual investment. This includes launching a wide range of new products like:
    *   **ESG and Climate Indexes:** Creating new, non-traditional benchmarks for sustainable investing, which is now a major new revenue stream.
    *   **Factor and Thematic Indexes:** Developing indexes that go beyond market capitalization (e.g., indexes focusing on innovation, genomics, or minimum volatility).
    *   **Analytics and Private Assets:** Expanding its software and data offerings (Analytics) and moving into the private assets space, which ties clients deeper into the MSCI ecosystem.
3.  **Investment in Knowledge (R&D):** While R&D expenses in its financials may not look like a traditional tech company's, MSCI's investment is primarily in **research, data, and methodology**, which is the core of its edge. It must constantly innovate, create new indexes, and update existing methodologies (like how R&D costs are accounted for in its own index construction) to ensure its benchmarks remain relevant in a rapidly changing investment landscape.

## Catalyst Analysis

MSCI Inc.'s catalysts for stock price increase are primarily rooted in its dominant index business and strategic expansion into faster-growing areas like private assets and climate-related products.

## **Catalysts for Stock Price Increase**

### **Near-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Strong Index-Linked ETF Flows (Asset-Based Fees)**
    *   The largest immediate driver is the continued growth in Assets Under Management (AUM) in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) linked to MSCI indices, which fuels the high-margin asset-based fees segment.
    *   MSCI recorded its largest quarterly ETF inflows since 2021 in Q2 2025, particularly benefiting from an investor rotation toward international markets (Developed Markets ex-U.S. indexes).

2.  **Expansion in New Client Segments**
    *   The company is successfully penetrating new client types, such as wealth managers, hedge funds, and asset owners, which provides a more diversified revenue base beyond traditional asset managers.
    *   This is evidenced by strong subscription growth with wealth managers and the completion of its largest-ever deal for its Wealth Manager product in Q2 2025.

3.  **Growth of Custom and Factor Indexes**
    *   Subscription run-rate growth for Custom Indexes remains strong, which allows clients to create personalized benchmarks, and factor-based ETFs continue to see solid inflows.
    *   New focus on products like the Private Credit Factor Model also helps capture value from rapidly evolving asset classes.

### **Long-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Dominance in Global Indexing and Recurring Revenue**
    *   The overall "long-term bull case" remains intact, supported by its high client retention rate and the sticky, recurring nature of its subscription and asset-based fee revenue model, which offers stability.

2.  **Leadership in Climate and Sustainability Solutions**
    *   Despite near-term headwinds in the U.S., the company's expansion in Climate Solutions, which saw subscription run-rate growth near 20% in Q2 2025, positions it for long-term growth as global sustainability investing accelerates.
    *   Strategic acquisitions and solutions, such as the one for renewable energy infrastructure, expand its footprint in new, high-growth sectors.

3.  **Growth in Private Markets (Real Assets and Private Capital)**
    *   MSCI is making strategic investments and launching new products for private assets, including real estate, infrastructure, and private capital solutions, targeting General Partners (GPs) and banks.
    *   This expansion into private markets is expected to be a significant long-term driver by bringing transparency to these fast-growing, non-public asset classes.

4.  **Leveraging Technology (AI/GenAI)**
    *   The company is focused on embedding new technologies, such as a recently launched GenAI-powered tool and modeling technology, to transform its risk analytics platform and enhance product offerings.

## **Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy**

*   **Key Growth Engine:** Management has explicitly identified the **asset-based fee run rate** (driven by ETF AUM and flows) as the "key growth engine" of the company.
*   **Active Asset Management:** The CEO, Henry Fernandez, stated in the Q2 2025 earnings call that he does **not** see a major catalyst for a rapid acceleration of growth in the active asset management industry in the near future.
*   **Sustainability Segment:** Management acknowledged a period of "muted demand" and slower sales in the Sustainability and ESG segment, expecting these current dynamics to **persist for the next several quarters**, while reiterating the long-term opportunity.
*   **Overall Strategy:** The core strategy is to be intensely focused on anticipating and investing in the biggest trends across the industry, to serve a broader base of clients beyond traditional asset managers, and to maintain a financially attractive business model.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of MSCI Inc.'s most recent definitive proxy statements (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure is strongly designed to align executive interests with those of long-term shareholders.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (MSCI Inc.)**

**1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

*   **Significant CEO Ownership:** The Chairman and CEO, Henry Fernandez, directly owns a substantial 2.8% of the company's shares, creating a high level of personal vested interest in the long-term performance and value of the stock.
*   **Highly Stringent Stock Ownership Requirements:** MSCI enforces extremely strict stock ownership guidelines for its Executive Committee members, which promotes an "owner-operator" mindset.
    *   The **Chief Executive Officer** and **President** are required to own company stock valued at **12 times** their annual base salary.
    *   **Other Management Committee Members** must own stock valued at **8 times** their annual base salary.
*   **Equity Retention:** Executives are required to retain a portion of the shares they receive from equity awards until they meet their substantial ownership requirements, further ensuring a sustained link to stock performance.

**2. Compensation Structure: Heavily At-Risk and Performance-Based**

*   **Dominant At-Risk Compensation:** The executive compensation mix is heavily weighted toward variable, at-risk pay, reinforcing a strong pay-for-performance culture.
    *   For the CEO in 2024, over **90%** of total compensation was classified as "at-risk" variable compensation (bonuses, stock, and options), with only a small portion being base salary (e.g., the CEO's salary was 6.4% of his total compensation).
*   **Multi-Year Performance Metrics:** Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), which constitute the largest portion of pay, are tied to the achievement of multi-year performance metrics, ensuring executives are rewarded for sustained growth rather than short-term spikes.
*   **Shareholder-Focused Equity Vesting:** Recent structural updates to the equity program, which have received high shareholder support (approximately 97.3% in a recent Say-on-Pay vote), include three-year cliff-vesting for Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance Stock Units (PSUs) tied to defined financial and operational metrics.

### **Conclusion**

**MSCI's management is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of shareholders.**

1.  The combination of exceptionally high stock ownership requirements (12x salary for the CEO) and a substantial personal ownership stake creates an **"owner-operator" mentality**, directly linking the personal wealth of the executive team to the long-term appreciation of the company's stock price.
2.  The compensation structure, where the vast majority of pay is **at-risk, performance-based, and subject to multi-year vesting**, ensures executives benefit only when sustained shareholder value is created through strong financial and operational results.
3.  The structure is designed to mitigate the incentive to "line their own pockets" with short-term gains, as their most valuable compensation (equity) is explicitly tied to long-term stock performance and cliff-vesting periods.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of its price history and technical indicators, here is an analysis of MSCI Inc. (MSCI):

1.  **Current Price Relative to 52-Week Low:** MSCI's stock price, at a recent closing value of approximately $\$567.62$, is currently trading about 16.59% above its 52-week low of $\$486.85$. The stock's 52-week high stands at $\$640.06$.

2.  **Technical Analysis - Trading Low?** The stock is *not* currently trading at a technical "low." Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) was recently noted at 75.20, which is typically considered an **overbought** signal, suggesting high buying pressure and a potential overvaluation in the short term.

3.  **Overall Technical Posture:** Despite the high RSI, the overall technical analysis sentiment has been described as "Bullish: Buy" with stronger buying pressure indicated by a long moving average. This suggests a longer-term uptrend despite short-term selling pressure or overbought conditions.

4.  **Significant Stock Drop:** A notable drop occurred in April 2024 when the stock "tanked 13.2%" following its Q1 earnings report. This decline was primarily attributed to higher-than-expected operating expenses and a concentration of "unusual client events," including a large banking client merger that led to elevated cancellations.

5.  **Long-Term Performance:** Despite the recent fluctuations, the stock has been a strong performer over the last year, with a reported gain of nearly 18%.

6.  **Analyst Consensus:** The investment community holds a positive outlook on MSCI, with the stock receiving a consensus rating of "Buy" from analysts. The average 12-month price target is approximately $\$652.70$, representing a potential upside of over 15% from recent prices.

## Long Thesis

MSCI operates as the essential 'plumbing' of the global investment world, holding a virtually unshakeable market position due to its status as the trusted gold standard for global index measurements. The long-term bull case is rooted in two factors: its high-margin, sticky financial model and its successful colonization of new, massive growth markets. Near term, the company benefits directly from sustained, massive global inflows into index funds (like ETFs), as trillions of dollars tracking MSCI indexes generate automatic, recurring fee revenue. Long term, its moat—based on extremely high customer switching costs and trusted brand identity—ensures exceptional pricing power and high profitability. Future growth is secured by leading the charge in creating essential new standards for two major trends: mandatory measurement of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and Climate Risk, and providing crucial transparency and data tools for the rapidly expanding Private Asset sector. The stability of the recurring subscription revenue, combined with leverage to rising markets and expansion into new required financial tools, guarantees continued outperformance.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The underlying assumption is that the powerful, decades-long trend of passive investing (money flowing into index funds and ETFs) continues globally. We must also assume that MSCI maintains its 'gold standard' industry status, preventing competitors like S&P or FTSE from significantly undermining its index licensing fees or market share. Furthermore, the bull case relies on global regulators and institutional investors continuing to prioritize and adopt ESG and Climate metrics, turning MSCI’s specialized data into mandatory operational tools. Finally, management must successfully execute its strategy to integrate complex private market data, translating that intellectual property into a scalable, high-margin revenue stream.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the holes and faults in the bullish thesis for MSCI Inc. (MSCI).

## Bear Case Thesis for MSCI Inc. (MSCI) - Critique and Flaws

The long thesis overstates MSCI’s pricing power and market stability while underestimating competitive threats, regulatory scrutiny, and the execution risk in its new growth segments.

### I. Flaws in the "Unshakeable Market Position" and "Pricing Power" Assumption

1.  **Pricing Power is Under Regulatory and Competitive Pressure:** The core assumption of "exceptional pricing power" is increasingly challenged by regulators, particularly in the UK, who have scrutinized the index industry's high profit margins (reported to be 70%–80%) and lack of fee transparency. This heightened regulatory oversight could force greater transparency and downward pressure on fees.
2.  **Customer Concentration Risk and Fee Concessions:** A significant portion of MSCI’s asset-based fees comes from a handful of large customers, most notably BlackRock, which accounts for nearly half of its asset-based fees. This concentration gives major clients substantial leverage to negotiate pricing concessions, as demonstrated by BlackRock's 10-year agreement with MSCI that reportedly includes pricing breaks.
3.  **The "Moat" is Breachable in Price Wars:** The idea of an "unshakeable" position ignores the history of a major client like Vanguard switching a significant portion of assets from MSCI to a competitor (FTSE Russell) to lower costs, which initiated a "price war" in the index space. Newer index providers like Solactive and Indxx, backed by regulatory scrutiny on high fees, are actively trying to disrupt the "Big 3" dominance, providing cheaper alternatives to smaller asset managers.
4.  **Premium Valuation Assumes Flawless Growth:** MSCI’s stock has historically traded at a premium, with its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio sitting well above the Capital Markets industry average, suggesting that investors are already pricing in significant, flawless, and perpetual high-margin growth. Any material slowdown in organic growth, index AUM inflows, or margin contraction due to fee pressure could lead to a significant valuation multiple compression.

### II. Flaws in the "Successful Colonization of New Growth Markets" Assumption

1.  **ESG/Climate Data is a Highly Competitive and Maturing Segment:** The ESG and Climate segment, while fast-growing, is not an exclusive domain for MSCI. Numerous strong competitors like S&P Global, Moody's, Sustainalytics (owned by Morningstar), and specialized providers are intensely vying for market share. This fierce competition could erode the segment's high-margin potential faster than anticipated.
2.  **"Greenwashing" Scrutiny and Standardization Risk:** The ESG industry faces increasing criticism regarding a lack of standardized scoring methodologies and allegations of "greenwashing." Global regulatory efforts to standardize ESG reporting (e.g., EU's SFDR) could lead to commoditization of basic ESG data, reducing the proprietary value and pricing power of MSCI’s specialized data products.
3.  **Uncertainty and Execution Risk in Private Assets:** The thesis relies on successful execution in the complex Private Asset sector. This sector is notoriously opaque, illiquid, and difficult to standardize, making it challenging to translate intellectual property into a scalable, high-margin subscription business quickly. The search results do not provide evidence of rapid, high-margin colonization, suggesting that execution risk and adoption speed are major unproven variables.

### III. Flaws in the "Sustained, Massive Global Inflows" Assumption

1.  **Sensitivity to Market Downturns:** A significant portion of MSCI's "automatic, recurring fee revenue" is *asset-based*, meaning its revenue is directly correlated with the value of the underlying assets tracking its indexes. A prolonged and severe global market downturn would cause a contraction in Assets Under Management (AUM), leading to an immediate and sharp decline in this high-margin revenue stream.
2.  **Macroeconomic and Financial Risk:** MSCI operates with a high level of debt, which increases its financial risk profile, especially in a rising interest rate environment or during a period of market stress when debt servicing becomes more expensive and challenging.

## Next Steps

This analysis has provided a strong qualitative foundation, especially regarding the company's competitive moat, management alignment, and the high-level long/bear cases.

However, to move from a qualitative assessment to a final investment conclusion, the analysis is missing specific, recent, and comparative financial data to *quantify* the risks and opportunities.

Here are the most important questions and steps to investigate next, focusing on financials, execution, and quantifying the core risks:

### **I. Quantify Financial Health and Valuation (Test the Bear Case on Premium Valuation and Debt)**

1.  **Valuation Multiples and Peer Comparison:** The stock is described as having a "premium valuation." The next step is to find the most recent TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) P/E, EV/EBITDA, and P/FCF ratios for MSCI (currently around 37.3x P/E and 27.8x EV/EBITDA on TTM basis).
    *   **Action:** Compare these multiples directly to its main public competitors, **S&P Global (SPGI)** and **Moody's (MCO)**, and the broader Capital Markets industry average (which MSCI already trades above).
    *   *Goal:* Determine if the premium is justified by expected growth or if the market is *overpaying* for its stability.

2.  **Debt Profile and Financial Flexibility:** The bear case flags high debt. MSCI's total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio for the first quarter of 2025 was 2.6x, and the company seeks to maintain a target range of 3.0x to 3.5x.
    *   **Action:** Confirm the current net debt to EBITDA ratio (reported as 2.5x to 2.6x recently) and investigate its debt maturity schedule.
    *   *Goal:* Assess how much rising interest rates or a market downturn (impacting EBITDA) would impact the cost of servicing the debt.

### **II. Quantify Growth Segments and Client Concentration (Test the Long/Bear Segment Theses)**

3.  **Revenue Segment Breakdown and Growth Rates:** While the Index segment is the largest, the long thesis depends on new growth pillars.
    *   **Action:** Find the precise dollar and percentage contribution of *each* segment (Index, Analytics, ESG & Climate/Real Estate) to total quarterly revenue (e.g., Q2 2025), and their respective organic subscription run-rate growth rates to validate the "Leadership in Climate" claim.
    *   *Goal:* Verify if the Analytics and ESG/Climate segments are growing fast enough to offset any potential deceleration in the dominant Index business. The Index segment remains the largest and is growing strongly, primarily driven by asset-based fees (up 18.1% in Q1 2025) and recurring subscriptions.

4.  **BlackRock/Client Concentration Risk:** The bear case highlights the risk of BlackRock's leverage.
    *   **Action:** Search for the *latest public figures* or analyst estimates on the percentage of **total revenue** (not just asset-based fees) derived from **BlackRock** or the top 5 largest clients.
    *   *Goal:* Quantify the true concentration risk and the financial impact if BlackRock exercised its pricing leverage.

### **III. Regulatory Risk and Competitive Action (Validate the Pricing Power Risk)**

5.  **Regulatory Threat on Fees and Margins:** The bear case mentioned UK regulatory scrutiny on high index margins.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the specific outcomes or proposals from the **UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** or the EU regarding index fee caps or required transparency.
    *   *Goal:* Determine if there is a concrete, non-speculative regulatory threat that could force a permanent reduction in the high operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA margin was 57.1% in Q1 2025).

6.  **Competitive Benchmarking in New Verticals:** The long thesis relies on dominance in ESG and Private Assets.
    *   **Action:** Search for market share data for **S&P Global ESG** and **Moody's ESG/Climate** offerings against MSCI to see if competition is truly eroding the moat in these new areas. Also, look for recent competitive announcements regarding Private Assets from rivals.
    *   *Goal:* Get external validation on whether MSCI is leading the "colonization of new growth markets" or just participating in highly competitive spaces.
