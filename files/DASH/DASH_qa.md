## Business Summary

DoorDash operates a three-sided technology platform that acts as a middleman, connecting customers who want goods delivered, local merchants (primarily restaurants) who sell the goods, and independent drivers called "Dashers" who handle the delivery logistics. The company earns revenue primarily by charging a commission fee (a percentage) to the merchants for using its platform, and by charging customers delivery and service fees. A secondary source of revenue comes from subscription services, like DashPass, which offer customers lower fees. While DoorDash is expanding into grocery and retail delivery across the US and internationally, the core function and majority of its earnings remain tied to the rapid delivery of prepared restaurant food.

## Business Model Risk

The DoorDash business model faces significant risk from intense competition, especially from rivals like Uber Eats, which forces the company to spend heavily on promotions and lower prices, potentially preventing sustained profitability. A major long-term threat is regulatory scrutiny regarding the classification of its drivers. If governments mandate that drivers be treated as formal employees instead of independent contractors, DoorDash's labor costs would surge dramatically, a concern that has frequently surfaced in regions like California. Additionally, since high commission fees can cause merchants to rely less on the service, DoorDash faces pressure to keep its rates competitive. Finally, because ordering delivery is a discretionary expense, the business is highly vulnerable to economic downturns or sustained inflation, which could lead customers to significantly reduce their order volume.

## Company History

The history of DoorDash, Inc. is the story of building a complex, real-time logistics network that started with a simple idea: making local businesses accessible to everyone.

### **The Inception and Founding Goal (2013)**

1.  **Founding and Initial Idea:** DoorDash was founded in January 2013 by four Stanford University students: Tony Xu, Stanley Tang, Andy Fang, and Evan Moore. They initially launched the service under the name **PaloAltoDelivery.com** to test their idea in a small area.
2.  **The Core Problem and Why It Was Founded:** The founders' motivation came from realizing that many small businesses, like a local macaroon shop they encountered, had plenty of customers but no efficient way to handle deliveries. This limited their growth and meant they had to turn away orders, showing a gap in the market for reliable logistics.
3.  **The First Operations:** The very first version of the company was extremely simple; the founders personally took orders over the phone, used a basic website with PDF menus, and drove their own cars to make the deliveries. This hands-on work helped them understand the real-world problems of delivery, which is often called "doing things that don't scale."
4.  **Rebranding and Mission:** In June 2013, after receiving seed money from the startup incubator Y Combinator, the company incorporated and rebranded as **DoorDash, Inc.** Their core mission was, and remains, to empower local economies by building a comprehensive platform for on-demand local commerce.

***

### **Early Problems and Headwinds (Obstacles)**

1.  **The Tipping Controversy (Pre-2019):** A major public relations problem arose over the company's payment model for its delivery workers, called "Dashers." Before 2019, DoorDash used customer tips to cover part of the guaranteed minimum pay for each order, meaning a tip did not always add extra money to the Dasher’s earnings.
2.  **Customer and Dasher Outcry:** This practice led to significant outrage from customers, who felt misled because they thought their tip was going *on top* of the Dasher's pay as a bonus for good service. It resulted in lawsuits claiming the company was diverting tips to subsidize its own labor costs.
3.  **Intense Competition and Financial Losses:** DoorDash has always operated in a fiercely competitive market against rivals like Uber Eats and GrubHub. This intense fight for market share forced the company to spend heavily on promotions, advertising, and expansion, leading to a history of net losses for many years.
4.  **Regulatory Challenges:** As a company that classifies its workers as independent contractors (not full employees), DoorDash and its peers constantly face legal and regulatory challenges over worker rights, benefits, and minimum wage laws in various regions.

***

### **Innovative Solutions and Pivotal Changes**

1.  **Solving the Logistics Problem with Technology:** The key to DoorDash’s success was moving past the manual, phone-and-car method and into advanced technology. They used **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to create a sophisticated logistics platform that balances the "three-sided marketplace" (Customer, Merchant, and Dasher).
2.  **The Smart Logistics Engine:** This AI system instantly calculates the most efficient way to fulfill an order, including predicting the time it will take the restaurant to prepare the food and selecting the best Dasher for the job based on location and route. This technological edge reduced delivery times, making the service faster and more reliable.
3.  **Fixing the Tipping Model:** Following the public and legal pressure, DoorDash changed its pay model in 2019 to one where Dashers now keep **100% of the customer tip** on top of the base pay offered by DoorDash. This restored trust with both customers and their delivery workforce.
4.  **Building Out the Merchant Platform:** To help restaurants grow, DoorDash developed tools beyond delivery, like **DoorDash Storefront**, which allows restaurants to build their own online ordering websites with zero commissions on the orders themselves. They also created **DashPass**, a subscription service that offers reduced or free delivery fees to customers for a monthly charge, building customer loyalty.

***

### **Fortunate Tailwinds and Present Day**

1.  **The COVID-19 Pandemic Tailwind (2020):** The pandemic was an enormous and unexpected tailwind that dramatically accelerated the company's growth. With stay-at-home orders and mandatory restaurant dining-room closures, food delivery became an essential service, forcing millions of people to order online for the first time.
2.  **Massive Adoption and Market Domination:** The pandemic-driven demand allowed DoorDash to cement its position as the largest food delivery platform in the United States. Many restaurants reported that the platform was crucial for their business survival during the crisis.
3.  **Expansion Beyond Food:** Using the strength of their logistics network, DoorDash began to expand its offerings far beyond just restaurant meals, starting with groceries, convenience items, and alcohol. This move positioned the company as a leader in broader local commerce, not just food delivery.
4.  **Current Goal (Local Commerce Infrastructure):** Today, DoorDash's goal is to be the leading local commerce platform in the world, building the "infrastructure" that connects all local businesses (restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies, retailers) with consumers. They operate in many countries and continue to grow their scale and revenue, including achieving net income in 2024.

## Moat Analysis

DoorDash, Inc.'s primary competitive advantage, or "moat," is built upon a self-reinforcing three-sided marketplace model that leverages its dominant scale, powerful network effects, and proprietary technology.

***

### 1. The Core Moat: Self-Reinforcing Network Effects

*   **Three-Sided Network:** DoorDash operates a marketplace connecting Consumers, Merchants (restaurants/stores), and Dashers (delivery drivers), where the value for each group increases as the others grow.
*   **Virtuous Cycle:** More merchants mean more customer choice, which attracts more consumers; more consumers and orders attract more Dashers, which leads to faster delivery times and lower costs, which, in turn, attracts even more merchants and consumers.
*   **Dominant Market Share:** DoorDash holds a commanding market leadership position in the United States, with over 60% of the national food delivery market share, which makes its network the most valuable for all participants.

### 2. Differentiation and Growth Drivers

*   **Focus on Suburbs:** DoorDash initially focused on suburban markets, which competitors often overlooked, where a lack of alternative options made their service more valuable and led to higher customer retention and order sizes (families ordering).
*   **Data and Logistics Technology:** Its proprietary machine learning algorithms and vast data set are constantly used to optimize everything from driver dispatching and order batching to predicting demand and setting the most efficient delivery routes. This focus on data-driven efficiency is what propelled the company's growth from a smaller player to the market leader.
*   **New Verticals:** The company is moving beyond just restaurants by aggressively expanding into new areas like grocery, convenience, and retail (e.g., pet supplies, home improvement), diversifying its revenue and deepening its utility to customers.

### 3. Pricing Power and Special Position

*   **Merchant Flexibility and Influence:** DoorDash offers merchants a tiered commission structure (e.g., 20% to 29%) based on the level of services, visibility, and customer reach they want. This allows the platform to maintain a strong fee structure while giving restaurants a choice.
*   **Incentivizing Price Parity:** To encourage customer satisfaction and reorder rates, DoorDash rewards merchants who keep their on-app menu prices close to their in-store prices with better visibility, influencing merchant behavior.
*   **Advertising Revenue:** Beyond commissions and delivery fees, a growing portion of revenue comes from advertisements, where merchants pay to have their listing promoted, demonstrating a further layer of pricing power from its high traffic.

### 4. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

*   **DashPass Subscription:** The **DashPass** monthly subscription service is a major competitive advantage, offering subscribers reduced or free delivery fees, which creates a powerful incentive for frequent, recurring orders and a strong customer "lock-in."
*   **High Retention:** The majority of DoorDash's Gross Order Volume (GOV) comes from repeat purchases from its existing customers, confirming a sticky and habitual consumer base.

### 5. Displacement Risk and R&D Investment

*   **Barriers to Entry:** While a competitor with massive capital (like Amazon or a deeply-funded start-up) could try to enter, replicating DoorDash's already scaled network of hundreds of thousands of merchants and millions of users in various locales is incredibly difficult and expensive.
*   **Constant Innovation:** The company must and does constantly invest in R&D, not in a traditional sense of a new physical product, but in its technological platform. This involves advanced machine learning, AI-driven logistics, and even exploring nascent technologies like drone delivery, which is essential to continuously improve efficiency and maintain its competitive edge in delivery speed and cost.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that might increase DoorDash's stock price can be divided into near-term operational success and long-term strategic growth.

### Management's Key Strategic Focus (from recent earnings calls)

Management, including CEO Tony Xu and CFO Ravi Inukonda, emphasizes a consistent approach focused on three main drivers:
1.  **Operational Efficiency and Profitability:** The company is focused on improving its operational efficiency to increase both its Net Revenue Margin and Adjusted EBITDA (profitability), aiming to re-invest those efficiency gains back into the business for growth.
2.  **Expansion and Scale:** The core strategy is to drive growth across all segments—restaurants, new verticals, and international markets—to expand the overall platform scale and utility.
3.  **Product Improvement and Engagement:** The goal is to drive overall order frequency up by making the product better, adding more categories (selection), and improving delivery times.

***

### Near-Term Catalysts (Operational and Financial)

1.  **Consistently Strong Financial Performance:** The company has recently achieved new quarterly records for Total Orders, Marketplace Gross Order Value (GOV), Revenue, and, notably, has generated positive GAAP net income for the first time as a public company.
2.  **Growth of the Advertising Business:** DoorDash's advertising platform is expanding rapidly and has reached a significant annualized revenue run rate, providing a high-margin revenue stream that improves overall profitability.
3.  **Improved Margins from Operational Efficiency:** The company is improving its logistics efficiency and unit economics, which has resulted in an expansion of the Net Revenue Margin and a surge in Adjusted EBITDA.
4.  **Increasing Consumer Engagement:** Growth in the membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, is driving up customer loyalty and average order frequency, which helps increase the overall volume of orders.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (Strategic and Growth Initiatives)

1.  **Expansion into New Verticals (The "Local Commerce Super-App"):** The strategy to expand beyond restaurant delivery into groceries, retail, health & beauty (like Ulta, Sephora), and home improvement (like Ace Hardware) aims to make DoorDash the default platform for local commerce.
2.  **Accelerated International Growth:** The international business, particularly through the Wolt acquisition, is growing faster than the U.S. market and is already gross profit positive, signaling a major avenue for future scaling.
3.  **Strategic Acquisitions:** Recent major acquisitions or proposed offers like Deliveroo (to expand global reach) and SevenRooms (to integrate hospitality technology for merchants) are expected to broaden the platform's capabilities and grow the total addressable market.
4.  **Advancements in Delivery Technology:** Investment in new technologies, including AI-powered logistics and pilots for autonomous delivery (e.g., with Waymo, or the DoorDash Dot robot), could reduce long-term operational costs and improve service efficiency.

---

## Management Record

The management of DoorDash, Inc. (DASH) is primarily led by its co-founder, Tony Xu, who has been instrumental in the company's growth from a startup to the dominant leader in the U.S. food delivery market.

### **CEO and Core Management Team**

1.  **CEO Tony Xu's Background:** Tony Xu is the Co-Founder and current CEO, having led the company since its inception in 2013. His background includes education at UC Berkeley and an MBA from Stanford, with prior experience at McKinsey & Company, eBay, and Square.
2.  **Inspiration and Vision:** Xu's mission to "grow and empower local economies" is deeply personal, stemming from his experience as the child of an immigrant who ran a restaurant, which inspired him to build a platform that helps local businesses succeed.
3.  **The Founding Team:** The company was co-founded by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and Evan Moore (former CTO). Co-founder Andy Mason served in the CEO role until 2019, but Xu has been the consistent public face and strategic leader, leading the company through its critical high-growth phase and IPO.

### **Track Record, Key Decisions, and Performance**

4.  **Contrarian Strategy:** An early, high-impact decision was to focus on suburban markets rather than densely populated cities, which was a contrarian strategy that recognized the greater need for delivery outside of walkable areas and proved instrumental to its U.S. market dominance.
5.  **Delivering Market Leadership:** Under Xu's leadership, DoorDash became the global leader in on-demand delivery, significantly increasing its U.S. food delivery market share to approximately 66%.
6.  **IPO and Pandemic Decisions:** Xu led the company's IPO in December 2020. During the pandemic, the management team made the decision to temporarily cut commissions for restaurants (a reported $100 million revenue hit) to support merchants, strengthening their relationship with local businesses.
7.  **Financial Performance and Shareholder Value:** The management team has delivered on the promise of profitability, reporting the company's first full year of positive GAAP net income in 2024. This financial strength, coupled with significant revenue growth (e.g., 27% Y/Y in Q4 2023) and strong free cash flow, led to the stock surging, though analysts note the valuation remains "stretched."
8.  **Strategic M&A:** The acquisition of Wolt Enterprises Oy in 2022 significantly expanded the company's international presence into 25 countries and enhanced its technology base, which now includes the fast-growing Wolt Ads business.

### **Future Strategy, Vision, and Popularity**

9.  **Super-App Vision:** The management's core long-term vision is to transform DoorDash from a food delivery app into a comprehensive 'super-app' for local commerce, aiming to deliver "any item within a city" from groceries and retail to hospitality technology.
10. **Growth Verticals:** Future strategy focuses on strengthening its core restaurant business while aggressively expanding into new verticals like grocery and retail, which is expected to drive overall profitability by creating greater logistical efficiency.
11. **Wall Street Sentiment:** Wall Street is generally "pleased" with the company's consistent growth and performance, which often beats analyst expectations, showcasing confidence in the executive team's execution of its growth strategy.
12. **Operational and Worker Perception:** Tony Xu is known to engage with feedback by personally reading hundreds of emails weekly from customers, Dashers (delivery workers), and merchants, acknowledging that many point out areas where the company is still "falling short" on execution. He also instituted a "WeDash" program where corporate employees perform deliveries to identify areas for operational improvement.

## Management Incentive

The management incentive and compensation structure for DoorDash, Inc. (DASH) exhibits a strong contrast between the CEO and the rest of the executive team, leading to a mixed conclusion regarding long-term shareholder alignment.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership (High Alignment, Founder Control):** DoorDash has a relatively high level of insider ownership, with executives and directors owning approximately 5.8% to 7.2% of the company's stock, which generally indicates an alignment with shareholder value. CEO and Founder Tony Xu directly owns a significant portion, valued in the billions of dollars, and the company operates with a dual-class stock structure, giving founders control over the voting power.

2.  **CEO Compensation Structure (Strong Long-Term Alignment):** CEO Tony Xu's annual cash compensation is very low ($300,000 base salary and $318,518 total compensation in 2024), which is significantly below the market average for comparable companies. His total compensation is overwhelmingly structured around a large, multi-year performance-based equity award, which requires the stock price to achieve a massive return (e.g., a 5x return over a seven-year period) to fully vest, strongly aligning his personal wealth with exceptional shareholder returns.

3.  **Other Executive Compensation Structure (Weaker Alignment):** In contrast to the CEO, the compensation for the other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is heavily weighted toward annual stock awards, reaching up to $13.6 million in total compensation in 2024 for the highest-paid NEO. These equity awards are predominantly **time-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** that vest over a four-year period, with no explicit performance hurdles tied to stock price or operational metrics.

4.  **Recent Trading Activity (A Note of Caution):** Recent insider trading activity for DoorDash shows a trend of selling shares over the last year, with no significant insider purchases, which can be viewed as a point of caution regarding management's near-term confidence in the stock's valuation.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

5.  **Alignment with Shareholders (CEO is aligned, NEOs less so):** The CEO's compensation structure is a model of long-term shareholder alignment, as he must deliver extreme stock price performance for his massive equity to vest, incentivizing an increase in shareholder value. The large, time-vesting RSU grants to other executives, however, mostly incentivize retention and vest simply for "showing up," suggesting they are less directly incentivized to act in the best interest of shareholders than the CEO.

6.  **Incentive to "Line Their Own Pockets":** While the low cash salary for the CEO discourages pocket-lining, the structure for other NEOs, relying heavily on time-based RSUs, means their primary wealth accumulation is guaranteed as long as they remain employed and the stock price holds or increases, which presents a risk of rewarding average performance rather than incentivizing outperformance for shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a technical and historical price analysis of DoorDash, Inc. (DASH):

1.  **Current Price Context:** DoorDash stock is trading significantly closer to its 52-week high of \$285.50 than its 52-week low of \$150.26, indicating a strong performance over the past year. The 52-week low occurred in late October 2024, while the 52-week high was reached very recently, in October 2025.
2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **76.6%** above its 52-week low of \$150.26, based on a recent price of approximately \$265.37.
3.  **Technical Analysis Verdict (Trading Low?):** The stock is **not trading low** based on technical analysis; rather, it has an "excellent" technical rating and is showing a strong overall performance. Short-term moving averages (5-day, 10-day) are generating "Sell" signals following a recent pullback from its all-time high, but longer-term indicators (50-day, 100-day, 200-day Moving Averages) are still signaling a "Buy." The long-term and medium-term trends remain positive and are in a rising trend channel.
4.  **Significant Rally (Up Bigly):** The stock has been "up bigly" in recent months, notably surging in August 2025 following its Q2 earnings report. This rally was fueled by the company providing a rosy outlook for third-quarter orders that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, signaling that demand for its services remained strong and resilient.
5.  **Notable Drop Explanation:** A significant drop occurred earlier in the year, around May 2025, after the company's Q1 revenue undershot analyst estimates. The sell-off happened despite the company beating earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and simultaneously announcing major acquisitions, including the U.K. firm Deliveroo.

## Long Thesis

DoorDash is transitioning from being just a dominant food delivery company to becoming the essential logistical infrastructure for all local commerce. In the near term, the company is proving it can be consistently profitable, driven by operational efficiencies and the high-margin advertising business. In the long term, its massive market share in the U.S. creates an unbeatable network effect: more users attract more merchants, leading to faster, cheaper delivery for everyone, reinforcing their lead. Management is aggressively expanding this efficient network beyond restaurants into massive new markets like groceries, retail, and pharmacy, aiming to be the single 'super-app' platform people use to get anything delivered quickly from any local store.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic outlook assumes four things: 1) DoorDash successfully maintains its current classification of drivers as independent contractors globally, avoiding a massive increase in labor costs. 2) The company's significant investment and expansion into new areas (groceries, retail) successfully attract high customer order volumes and become profitable quickly. 3) Intense competition from rivals like Uber Eats does not force DoorDash into endless price wars, allowing profit margins to continue expanding. 4) Consumer demand for delivery, a discretionary expense, remains resilient even if the economy weakens.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key flaws and holes in the DoorDash long thesis, structured around a bear case for the stock.

## Bear Case Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

### 1. The Threat of Rising Labor Costs and Regulatory Pressure (Flaw in Assumption 1)

*   **Labor Costs Are Rising Anyway:** The assumption that DoorDash will avoid a massive increase in labor costs is flawed because rising expenses are already manifesting through new regulations and minimum pay requirements, even without full reclassification. DoorDash's 2024 profit outlook was hurt by higher labor costs stemming from new rules, indicating a growing structural cost.
*   **Ongoing Regulatory Headwinds:** While the California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 22 (maintaining the independent contractor status in California), the company continues to face local regulatory threats like new pay rules in New York City and Seattle, which mandate increased compensation and directly impact the path to sustained, expanding profit margins.
*   **International Uncertainty:** The company's expansion into international markets, particularly with the Wolt acquisition, introduces significant exposure to diverse and often more pro-labor regulatory environments than the US, posing an unquantified risk to global unit economics.

### 2. Profitability and Unit Economics of New Verticals (Flaw in Assumption 2)

*   **Slow March to Profitability in New Verticals:** The assumption that new areas like groceries and retail will "become profitable quickly" is optimistic. While DoorDash is seeing rapid growth in U.S. grocery orders (doubling year-over-year in Q1 2024), management has admitted these new businesses are "not truly optimized for efficiency," suggesting they are still in a heavy investment phase.
*   **Lower Margin Trade-Off:** The shift in consumer behavior, where strong growth in grocery orders is offsetting slower restaurant demand, suggests consumers are trading down to lower-margin deliveries (e.g., buying groceries instead of a prepared meal). This mix-shift puts pressure on the overall average profit per order (unit economics).
*   **The "Super-App" Challenge:** Moving from restaurant delivery (a high-frequency, small-basket product) to groceries and retail (larger, heavier, more complex logistics) fragments the network effect, as the same driver base may not be as efficient for all product types, limiting the synergistic value of the "essential logistical infrastructure" goal.

### 3. Network Effect Degradation and Intense Competition (Flaw in Assumption 3)

*   **Advertising Over-Reliance and Margin Strain:** The idea of an "unbeatable network effect" is undercut by the reality of intense competition. To maintain its lead, DoorDash is forced to significantly increase its advertising expense, which strains the very profit margins the long thesis claims are expanding.
*   **Persistent Price Wars:** Competition with rivals like Uber Eats remains fierce, leading both companies to intensify promotional campaigns and potentially maintain price differences to retain users, which directly undermines the ability to expand profit margins.
*   **International Underperformance:** While DoorDash is dominant in the U.S. with nearly 67% market share, Uber Eats is the top food delivery operator globally, suggesting DoorDash's international expansion (a core driver of the long-term thesis) faces an established, formidable global rival, which necessitates heavy, often unprofitable, investment.

### 4. Consumer Demand Fragility (Flaw in Assumption 4)

*   **Discretionary Spend Vulnerability:** The assumption that demand for delivery will remain "resilient even if the economy weakens" ignores the fact that delivery is a high-cost discretionary service. Consumer research shows a high sensitivity to shipping costs and a greater willingness to trade speed for lower cost, which a weakening economy would only accelerate.
*   **Cost-Cutting Behavior:** While overall e-commerce is resilient, delivery fees and restaurant markups on delivery apps can inflate the cost of a meal by 15-25%. This high "convenience premium" is the first thing consumers will cut as their financial comfort declines, leading to a drop in the most profitable restaurant orders.

## Next Steps

The analysis you have completed is comprehensive, clearly outlining the moat, catalysts, and risks, especially the conflict between profitability and regulatory pressure.

The next steps should focus on quantifying the specific risks and opportunities mentioned in the bear case to determine their actual financial impact.

Here are the most important questions and investigation steps remaining:

1.  **Quantify the Impact of Rising Labor Costs (The Primary Bear Risk):**
    *   **Question:** What is the actual, quantified financial impact of the new regulations in high-cost cities like NYC and Seattle on DoorDash's overall *unit economics* and *Marketplace GOV*?
    *   **Next Step:** Search for recent DoorDash earnings call transcripts or investor letters (Q4 2024, Q1 2025) that detail the financial change in these specific markets (e.g., impact on total orders, reduction in Dasher hours, or explicit cost increases) to assess if the cost is truly contained or represents a scalable threat.

2.  **Determine Unit Economics for New Verticals (The Primary Long-Term Catalyst):**
    *   **Question:** While the long thesis touts expansion into Groceries and Retail, what is the reported *gross margin* for the "New Verticals" segment versus the established restaurant business?
    *   **Next Step:** Search for analyst reports or company presentations that break down the Gross Order Value (GOV) or Revenue by segment, specifically looking for *Contribution Profit* or *Gross Margin* differences to prove or disprove the bear case's concern about lower-margin orders.

3.  **Evaluate Current Valuation in Context:**
    *   **Question:** Given the stock is near its all-time high, is the current valuation justified by growth, or is it "stretched" as noted?
    *   **Next Step:** Compare DoorDash’s current and forward Price-to-Sales (P/S) and Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiples (e.g., P/S around 9.35 and EV/EBITDA over 95.4) to its historical median and to key competitor Uber, to benchmark the premium the market is currently assigning for its growth.

4.  **Assess International Expansion (Wolt's True Performance):**
    *   **Question:** How is the Wolt acquisition performing in its key European markets against major rivals like Just Eat Takeaway and Delivery Hero, beyond the general competition with Uber Eats?
    *   **Next Step:** Investigate recent market share data or competitive reports that specifically show Wolt's current standing, growth rate, and path to profitability in core non-US markets to validate the claim of "rapid international growth" as a material long-term catalyst.

5.  **Test the Moat by Analyzing Pricing Power (Take Rate):**
    *   **Question:** Is DoorDash's dominant U.S. market share translating into demonstrable pricing power?
    *   **Next Step:** Find and compare the reported "take rate" (the percentage of GOV the company keeps from merchant commissions and fees) for DoorDash versus Uber Eats in the most recent quarters to see if the market leader is extracting a significantly higher fee.
