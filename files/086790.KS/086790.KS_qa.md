## Business Summary

Hana Financial Group is a large financial conglomerate primarily operating in South Korea, catering to both individual consumers and large businesses. Its core business model is traditional banking: accepting deposits from customers who seek a secure place for their money and then lending that money out in the form of consumer mortgages, personal loans, and corporate debt. The profit is generated from the difference between the low interest paid to depositors and the higher interest charged to borrowers. They also earn non-interest income from fee-based services, such as managing wealth, providing credit cards, and advising companies on mergers. While the domestic South Korean market provides the bulk of their revenue, the group is expanding its presence, especially across the Asia Pacific region, to diversify its customer base.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is credit risk, which is the possibility that borrowers will default on their loans. Given the group’s large exposure to the highly indebted South Korean household and real estate sectors, an unexpected economic slowdown or a sharp hike in interest rates could quickly lead to widespread defaults, which directly harms the group's earnings. This risk has been a major concern during past financial crises, such as the late 1990s, and remains a constant threat given current high debt levels. Long-term risks include intense competition from digital-first financial technology (Fintech) companies that are often faster and cheaper, potentially eroding the traditional customer base. Furthermore, regulatory risk is perpetual; government intervention to control debt levels or cap interest rates can immediately limit the group’s profitability and growth potential. Finally, South Korea’s aging and shrinking population presents a structural challenge, restricting the domestic pool of future customers and limiting long-term market expansion opportunities.

## Company History

This history lesson provides a detailed look at Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790.KS), a major South Korean financial powerhouse.

### The Foundation and Early Years (1971–2005)

1.  **Inception as a Private Finance Company (1971):** The company's story began not as a bank, but as the **Korea Investment Finance Corporation**. It was a groundbreaker at the time because it was the first financial company in South Korea funded entirely by private capital.

2.  **Transformation into a Commercial Bank (1991):** After two decades, the company successfully transitioned into a full-fledged commercial bank, renaming itself **Hana Bank**. This shift was a strategic move to offer a wider range of services to customers.

3.  **The Goal for the Holding Company (2005):** **Hana Financial Group Inc.** was officially established in December 2005. The purpose of forming a holding company was to consolidate and manage its various businesses—including banking, securities, and asset management—under a single, unified corporate umbrella to create greater efficiency and scale.

### The Era of Consolidation and Growth (2005–2015)

4.  **Early Expansion into Non-Banking (2005):** Right after its formation, Hana Financial Group immediately expanded its services by acquiring Daehan Investment and Securities, a major step toward becoming a comprehensive financial group that offers services beyond traditional banking.

5.  **Major Problem: The KEB Acquisition Headwind (2012):** Hana made its biggest power play by acquiring a controlling stake in the state-owned **Korea Exchange Bank (KEB)** in 2012. However, the acquisition was immediately met with strong **headwinds** from the KEB labor union, who opposed the merger and feared job losses, significantly delaying the complete integration of the two banks.

6.  **Solution and Strategic Consolidation (2015):** After several years of opposition, Hana Financial Group successfully completed the merger of Hana Bank and KEB in 2015, creating the new flagship entity, **KEB Hana Bank**. This bold move instantly turned the group into one of the largest financial institutions in Korea, giving it the necessary size and market share to compete with its biggest rivals.

### The Modern, Digital, and Global Era (2015–Present)

7.  **Headwind: Global Economic Shifts and Domestic Challenges:** In recent years, the group has faced **headwinds** like prolonged low economic growth, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, a rapidly aging population in South Korea, and the rise of new tech companies (Big Tech and FinTech) breaking down the traditional boundaries of the financial industry.

8.  **Innovative Solution: Digital Transformation (DX):** To counter the rise of FinTech rivals, Hana committed to a rapid **Digital Transformation**. This included launching a mobile-first platform called "Hana 1Q" that allows users to handle banking, stock, card, and other financial transactions from a single app. They also invested in automation technology and MyData services (which organize a customer's scattered financial data into one view).

9.  **Innovative Solution: Dual Global Expansion Strategy (Tailwind):** Hana realized the domestic market was reaching maturity, prompting an aggressive "dual global strategy."
    *   It focuses on high-growth **Southeast Asian markets** with M&A and digital services, such as launching **LINE Bank** in Indonesia (a digital bank) in collaboration with a global tech company. This regional focus acts as a significant **tailwind** for future growth.
    *   It also strengthens investment banking operations in major financial hubs like New York and London.

10. **Current Strategy and Goal: "Leaping Forward to Become the Top Financial Group in Asia" (Present Date):** The group’s current vision for the future is to become the best financial group in Asia by reinforcing three core strategies: **global expansion**, **digital innovation**, and **financial competitiveness**.

11. **Future-Focused Solutions (2024-2025):** The company is currently exploring non-banking M&As, establishing a security token exchange, and forging significant partnerships with major tech companies like Naver and SK Group to develop AI-based financial products and a next-generation credit rating model.

12. **Tailwind: Shareholder Value-Up Program (2024-2025):** The South Korean government's focus on boosting the stock market through its "corporate value-up program" provided a regulatory **tailwind**. In response, Hana Financial Group committed to an aggressive shareholder return strategy, including its largest-ever stock buyback and the implementation of fixed, predictable quarterly cash dividends to boost investor confidence and shareholder value.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," of Hana Financial Group Inc. is primarily built upon its massive **scale,** a comprehensive **integrated financial platform,** and a deliberate strategy of **digital and international diversification** in a heavily regulated industry.

### Analysis of Hana Financial Group's Moat

1.  **Scale and Regulatory Moat (Hard to Displace)**
    *   Hana Financial Group is one of South Korea's four largest commercial banking groups, which provides a significant **scale advantage** in terms of capital base and operational efficiency.
    *   The banking industry's strict **regulatory and compliance framework** serves as a formidable barrier to entry for most competitors, making it extremely difficult for a new company to emerge with more capital and displace an established giant like Hana.
    *   Its substantial asset base (approximately KRW 600 trillion in 2024) allows for **economies of scale,** meaning it can spread its operating costs over a larger base, enabling competitive pricing and greater resilience.

2.  **Differentiation: Comprehensive Financial Ecosystem**
    *   The Group's main differentiator is its **comprehensive financial ecosystem,** offering a wide range of services from a single entity: commercial banking, investment banking, asset management, insurance, and credit cards.
    *   This "one-stop shop" model is a key advantage over rivals who may specialize in only one area, fostering customer loyalty and providing multiple **cross-selling opportunities** for the Group.
    *   A key part of its historical growth was the successful integration of **Korea Exchange Bank (KEB)**, which merged KEB’s strength in large corporate finance with the original Hana Bank’s strength in retail banking, creating a more robust, diversified business.

3.  **Pricing Power and Special Position**
    *   In the traditional Korean financial services sector, **pricing power is relatively low** due to intense competition among the major banking groups, which leads to minimal switching costs for customers in standard loan and deposit products.
    *   The Group's **special market position** comes from its status as having the **most extensive overseas operations** among Korean financial groups, which differentiates it and provides a growth engine outside of the saturated domestic market.
    *   The growth in **fee income** from diversified services like foreign exchange, retirement pensions, and credit cards (non-interest income) suggests it has some pricing leverage in specialized, non-banking products.

4.  **Customer Stickiness (Recurring Revenue)**
    *   Banking is inherently a **sticky and recurring** business—customers rarely change their primary bank account, mortgage, or corporate credit line due to the hassle and required paperwork (switching costs), making the contracts long-term.
    *   The strategy of offering a full **suite of products** and personalized services, often bundled together, significantly increases the switching cost, thus locking customers into the "Hana Network" for multiple financial needs.
    *   Its large **B2B presence** in corporate finance creates very sticky, long-term relationships with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations.

5.  **Digital Innovation and Network Effects**
    *   The Group has actively built a moat through **digital transformation,** notably through the **Hana 1Q app** and by launching **LINE Bank** (a digital bank), which attracts a younger, digitally native customer base and improves operational efficiency.
    *   This is a strong investment in **R&D** (digital and AI capabilities) and is crucial because the industry must constantly innovate to compete with agile fintech companies and Big Tech rivals.
    *   **Network effects** are present in the form of a **cross-selling loop:** more customers on the platform allow for more data, which allows for better personalized product bundling, which in turn attracts more customers, making the entire ecosystem more valuable to each user.

In summary, Hana Financial Group's long-term competitive advantage is the synergy between its **historical foundation of scale and regulatory protection** and its ongoing, aggressive investment in **digital technology and business diversification** to make its customer relationships deeper and harder to leave.

2.  **Predictable and Higher Dividends:** Management is planning to implement a new policy of fixed annual cash dividends and evenly distributed quarterly cash dividends to enhance the predictability of investor returns. The total dividend per share for 2024 was already increased, supporting the near-term appeal of the stock.
3.  **Core Profitability and Stability:** The group recently reported a record high net profit, driven by an increase in commission income from a diversified revenue portfolio and stable financial ratios like the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Expansion in Non-Banking Businesses (Management Strategy):** The CEO, Ham Young-joo, is actively looking into mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in non-banking sectors to secure new growth engines, with an expressed goal of increasing the non-banking sector's contribution to the group's net profit to 30%.
2.  **Digital and Fintech Innovation (Management Strategy):** Hana Financial is pursuing strategic partnerships with major tech firms like Naver and Kakao and establishing a Future Growth Division to accelerate its expansion into new financial territories. This strategy also includes projects in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, such as developing a next-generation credit rating model.
3.  **Commitment to Corporate Value-Up:** The company's corporate value-up plan, which management is strongly committed to, aims to maintain a Return on Equity (ROE) above 10% through improved financial performance, signalling a sustained focus on capital efficiency.

### Management's Explicit Strategy from Earnings Calls

Management's strategy, frequently reiterated in investor events, centers on two main pillars:

1.  **Shareholder Value Enhancement:** In their recent 2024 earnings calls, management emphasized their "strong commitment" to the "Value-Up" plan, stating that shareholder return measures will pursue a "global standard" backed by sustainable profitability. They highlighted the KRW 400 billion share buyback as a core element of maximizing shareholder value.
2.  **Future Growth Engines:** The management has explicitly mentioned focusing on reinforcing core businesses while simultaneously using partnerships and M&As to uncover new businesses in areas like fintech and Big Tech. The creation of the Future Growth Division and its senior-specialized service, 'Hana The Next,' were launched to secure new future growth engines.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of public filings and compensation reports for Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790.KS), here is an analysis of management incentives and compensation:

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

1.  **Insider Ownership (Personal Stake):** The personal stock ownership by individual insiders (managers and directors) is **very low**, representing only about **0.0108%** of the company's shares. This lack of a significant personal wealth stake in the company's equity suggests weak intrinsic alignment between the personal financial interests of the top managers and the long-term share price performance.

2.  **Broader Employee Stock Ownership:** The Hana Financial Group Employee Stock Ownership Association holds a small but more significant stake of approximately **1.49%** of common shares. While this fosters general employee alignment, it does not compensate for the low direct ownership by top decision-making executives.

3.  **Compensation Structure: Performance-Linked Incentives:** The compensation structure for the Chairman includes a large variable component, explicitly broken down into salary and significant **performance-linked bonuses** (e.g., the Chairman's 2024 H1 bonus was more than three times his salary). This structure ties a substantial portion of executive pay directly to corporate results.

4.  **Compensation Structure: Long-Term Alignment:** The performance-linked bonuses include a component of **long-term performance-linked stocks (PS)**, which aims to defer compensation and incentivize sustained, multi-year performance. This long-term incentive mechanism partially mitigates the risk of executives focusing solely on short-term profits.

5.  **Corporate Strategy and Shareholder Focus:** Hana Financial Group has a clear, public commitment to its shareholders, demonstrated by its "Value-Up Plan," which includes a strategic goal to raise its Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to 50% by 2027. The company has backed this strategy with concrete actions, such as a record-largest share buyback and cancellation, and increasing its dividend per share.

6.  **Governance Oversight:** The **Management Development and Compensation Committee** exists to formulate performance-improvement plans and determine executive compensation. The presence of outside directors on key governance committees is intended to provide independent oversight of executive incentives and performance.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive Alignment

**Overall, the management of Hana Financial Group appears to be contractually and strategically incentivized to act in the interest of shareholders, despite a lack of high personal insider ownership.**

*   **Incentivized to Act in Shareholder Interest (Conclusion):** The compensation structure, with its mandatory **long-term performance-linked stock** component, and the explicit, publicly-stated **Value-Up Plan** focused on increasing Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and dividends, create strong top-down incentives for management to drive shareholder value.
*   **Risk of Self-Interest (Caveat):** The **critically low individual insider ownership** (0.0108%) means the direct financial risk to the managers' personal wealth from a declining stock price is negligible. This reliance on incentive structure, rather than personal equity stake, places a heavy burden on the Compensation Committee to ensure performance metrics are rigorously aligned with shareholder returns.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of its price history and technical indicators, here is an analysis of Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790.KS).

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading significantly higher than its annual low. Based on a recent price of KRW 87,100 and a 52-week low of KRW 51,500, Hana Financial Group Inc. is approximately **69.13%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Trading Status (Technical Analysis):** The stock is **not trading low** based on technical momentum indicators; rather, it is in a strong uptrend. As of recent data, the share price was trading more than **27% higher** than its 200-day moving average, signaling significant positive momentum.

3.  **Relative Valuation:** While the price has risen substantially, the stock still appears fundamentally cheap relative to its peers. Its Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is very low at around **0.55**, suggesting the market values the company at less than its net assets.

4.  **Significant Price Performance:** The stock has been **up bigly** over the past year, with an increase of nearly **50%** over the last 12 months, and over **41%** in the last six months. This strong appreciation is due to a combination of factors, including attractive valuation and shareholder-friendly actions.

5.  **Reason for the Rise (Shareholder Returns):** A major driver of the stock's performance has been the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Hana Financial Group Inc. announced and executed a large-scale **Equity Buyback Plan**, which expired in 2025.

6.  **Reason for the Rise (Valuation & Dividends):** The company is considered one of the best yield stocks in its sector, with a trailing dividend yield nearing **4.84%**. Its low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio (around 6.62) and high dividend expectations have led analysts to have a positive "Buy" or "Overweight" consensus recommendation and strongly revise their target prices upwards.

---

## Long Thesis

Hana Financial Group is a stable banking giant that is currently undervalued and committed to giving large amounts of cash back to its owners (shareholders) while simultaneously setting up new avenues for future growth. In the short term, the stock is likely to rise because the company is actively buying back its own shares and has committed to higher, predictable quarterly dividends. This commitment is strongly supported by the Korean government's push to boost stock valuations. For the long term, Hana is diversifying its revenue sources in two major ways: first, by aggressively expanding into high-growth markets across Southeast Asia through partnerships and digital banking; and second, by acquiring non-banking businesses to rely less on traditional interest income. Management is highly motivated to succeed, aiming for top-tier returns and ensuring the stock price eventually reflects the company's full value.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core South Korean economy must remain stable enough so that current high levels of household debt do not lead to widespread loan defaults and damage the Group’s profitability. Management must successfully execute the ambitious strategy of growing non-banking income to 30% via effective mergers and acquisitions, and international expansion must deliver meaningful profit growth to offset the slowing domestic market. Finally, the company must continue to follow through on its announced shareholder return program (buybacks and high dividends) to ensure the stock’s current low valuation gap eventually closes.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This long thesis contains several critical assumptions that are directly contradicted or complicated by recent market trends and the company's own financial execution, forming the basis of a strong bear case.

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis (Bull Case)

1.  **Understated Domestic Credit Risk:** The bull case's foundational assumption of a "stable" South Korean economy is a significant vulnerability. Financial regulators and the Bank of Korea have recently cited the country's high and growing household debt-to-GDP ratio (one of the highest globally) as a major risk to financial stability. This risk is amplified as insolvencies from low-income, low-credit borrowers are already being observed, which could necessitate higher provisioning and directly undermine the Group’s profitability.

2.  **Failure in Non-Banking Diversification:** The thesis relies on management successfully executing an "ambitious strategy of growing non-banking income to 30%." However, recent performance shows a significant failure in execution, with the non-banking profit contribution dropping to a much lower percentage in the first half of 2025, even as the Group achieved record net profit. This indicates a *growing* rather than a decreasing reliance on traditional interest income from the core (and risky) banking business.

3.  **Contradiction in M&A Strategy:** The long thesis assumes aggressive "acquiring non-banking businesses" will be the catalyst for the 30% goal, but management has publicly stated they will avoid "excessive M&A," only pursuing acquisitions with a solid foundation, which suggests a conservative and slower path that is unlikely to achieve the rapid 30% target.

4.  **Capital Constraint from Shareholder Returns:** The aggressively high shareholder return program (buybacks and high dividends), while appealing, may be a double-edged sword. To sustain a high Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target of 50% by 2027, the company reduces the capital available for large, value-creating acquisitions—the very mergers and acquisitions needed to hit the non-banking diversification goal.

5.  **International Growth as a Minor Offset:** While international expansion is a positive strategy, the long thesis overestimates its short-term impact. The profits from Southeast Asia, while growing, may not be able to deliver "meaningful profit growth to offset the slowing domestic market" quickly enough, especially if a domestic debt crisis forces a major increase in loan loss provisions.

---
## Bear Case Thesis for Hana Financial Group Inc.

The optimistic narrative of Hana Financial Group Inc. is fundamentally undermined by a deteriorating domestic credit environment and a struggling diversification strategy, meaning the announced high shareholder returns are an unsustainable use of capital that will leave the company exposed to a future downturn.

1.  **Risk of Systemic Loan Defaults:** The principal source of profit, the domestic South Korean banking business, is exposed to one of the world's most indebted household sectors. A combination of sustained high interest rates and a potential correction in home prices could trigger a wave of loan delinquencies and necessitate massive loan loss provisioning, severely damaging the Group’s balance sheet and core profitability.

2.  **Increased Reliance on Core Banking:** Despite an aggressive diversification goal, the Group's efforts to grow non-banking income have recently regressed, indicating poor execution. The Group is becoming *more* reliant on its main bank's interest income, which ties its fortune even more closely to the precarious domestic lending market.

3.  **The Capital Trap:** The high, predictable shareholder return policy—while closing the valuation gap in the short-term—forces a significant drain on capital. This self-imposed constraint limits the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio and reduces the financial buffer and flexibility needed for two critical needs: absorbing unexpected domestic credit losses and making the large, value-accretive non-banking acquisitions necessary to achieve their long-term growth targets.

4.  **International Growth Drag:** The international expansion, primarily in Southeast Asia, is a multi-year project that carries execution and regulatory risks in foreign markets. The pace of profit growth from these overseas ventures is unlikely to be sufficient to counteract a sudden, major earnings shock from a domestic credit event or the persistent underperformance of their non-banking domestic affiliates.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your detailed analysis and the public information gathered, you have created a robust pro/con framework. The next steps should focus on quantifying the remaining uncertainties and rigorously testing the weakest parts of the bull case against its key competitors.

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate:

### I. Quantify the Resilience to Domestic Credit Risk (Bear Case Validation)

The bear case highlights a "Risk of Systemic Loan Defaults," but the company also mentions "proactive risk management." The key is to see who is *better prepared* among peers.

1.  **NPL Coverage Ratio: Comparison to Peers:**
    *   **Question:** How does Hana Financial Group's latest NPL (Non-Performing Loan) Coverage Ratio (115.2% as of Q1 2025) compare directly to its major competitors (KB Financial, Shinhan Financial, Woori Financial)?
    *   **Goal:** This ratio fell significantly and is the lowest of the four major Korean financial groups, approaching the regulatory floor of 100%. Investigating this will determine if the "Capital Trap" is already compromising its safety buffer compared to rivals who maintain higher provisioning.
    *   **Action:** Explicitly find the Q1 2025 NPL coverage ratios for KB (133.1%), Shinhan (128.8%), and Woori (132.7%) to confirm Hana's relative position.

2.  **Credit Quality Breakdown (Real Estate Exposure):**
    *   **Question:** What is the Group's direct and indirect exposure (e.g., through project financing, or PF) to the non-Seoul/non-capital region real estate market, which is experiencing price declines?
    *   **Goal:** The bear case mentions a systemic risk. Finding the percentage of the Group's corporate loans tied to lower-tier, high-risk real estate PF will help quantify the actual worst-case loss scenario.

### II. Verify the Significance of International Growth (Bull Case Scrutiny)

The long thesis relies on international expansion as a "Tailwind," but the current net profit contribution suggests a "Minor Offset."

3.  **Consolidated Overseas Profit Percentage:**
    *   **Question:** What is the most recent (2024 full year or Q1 2025) **percentage of total group net income** derived from all overseas operations?
    *   **Goal:** The general search was inconclusive, but the core issue remains: Is the international business generating a profit percentage that can materially offset domestic risk, or is it just a headline-driver that is too small (e.g., in the low single digits for a large group like Hana)? Hana's overseas bank net income, for example, *dropped* by 36% in the first half of 2025.

4.  **Vietnam Equity Investment Performance (BIDV):**
    *   **Question:** What are the most recent (2024/2025) reported valuation gains or losses from Hana's key equity investment in the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV)?
    *   **Goal:** The excellent BIDV performance was a major driver of overseas income in 2021. Finding the current market valuation or latest net income contribution from this specific asset will show if the international "tailwind" is still accelerating or has decelerated.

### III. Evaluate the Management's Non-Banking Execution (Key Strategic Flaw)

The analysis shows non-banking reliance on net profit is very high at **89%**, far above peers like KB (55%) and Shinhan (78%), directly contradicting the long thesis's diversification pillar.

5.  **M&A Target Pipeline and Non-Banking Capital Allocation:**
    *   **Question:** Beyond the general intent, what is the specific breakdown of the KRW 400 billion *annual* capital expenditure budget (CapEx) for 2024/2025 allocated to M&A, digital transformation (DX), and AI partnerships versus the total announced shareholder return of KRW 600 billion (400B original + 200B additional buyback)?
    *   **Goal:** Comparing the capital allocated to "growth" (M&A/DX) versus "shareholder return" (buybacks/dividends) provides a definitive, quantifiable measure of which strategy management is *actually* prioritizing: the long-term goal (30% non-banking) or the short-term catalyst (Value-Up).

### IV. Stock Valuation Relative to Competitor Quality

6.  **P/B Ratio vs. ROE Adjusted for Quality:**
    *   **Question:** Considering Hana Financial Group's lower diversification (89% banking reliance) and lower NPL coverage (115.2%) compared to KB (55% reliance, 133.1% NPL coverage), is Hana's lower P/B ratio simply warranted due to lower quality and higher risk, rather than being "undervalued"?
    *   **Goal:** This requires a qualitative judgment, but researching analyst notes that compare the **Discount-to-NAV** (P/B) specifically to the peer's *CET1 ratio* and *NPL coverage ratio* would confirm if the "undervalued" premise is a true bargain or a reflection of fundamental structural weakness.
