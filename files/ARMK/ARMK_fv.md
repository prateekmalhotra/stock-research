### **II. Business Engine Analysis & Future Assumptions**

Aramark's primary business engine is the Food and Support Services (FSS) segment, which drives growth through three main levers, as noted in earnings calls: **Base Business Volume**, **Pricing Actions**, and **Net New Business Wins**.

- **Momentum:** The company reported a historic year in FY2024, with 10% Organic Revenue growth, driven by base business and a record $1.4 billion in annualized gross new business wins (9% of prior year revenue), a key indicator of future expansion.
- **Management Guidance:** Management anticipates "another strong year in 2025" and "continued margin improvement and an outsized performance" in FY2025 and FY2026, driven by new business maturity and closing the inflation/price recovery lag.

#### **A. Revenue Projections (Conservative Engine)**

To project revenue, a conservative, tapering growth rate is applied:

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate (Organic) | Justification (Conservative Assumption) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | 8.0% | Below the recent 10% organic growth in FY2024, but reflects the strong $1.4B new business backlog and anticipated acceleration in the first half of the year. |
| **FY2026** | 7.0% | Reflects continued momentum as new business matures, but a slight deceleration from peak post-spin growth. |
| **FY2027** | 5.0% | Tapers toward a stable, long-term growth rate, reflecting a more normalized market and competitive environment. |
| **FY2028 - 2030** | 4.0% | A conservative long-term growth rate for a mature, large-scale Food and Facilities Services company, balancing net new business, pricing, and stable volume. |

#### **B. Margin Projections (Conservative Margin Expansion)**

Management explicitly guides for **margin expansion** over the next few years. The base FY2024 Net Income Margin (continuing operations) was 1.51%. The projection assumes a steady, conservative increase in Net Income Margin, reflecting operating leverage, cost control, and supply chain efficiencies.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Justification (Conservative Assumption) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | 1.80% | Reflects initial margin expansion and recovery, below management's guidance for "outsized performance." |
| **FY2026** | 2.10% | Continues the expansion as new business matures and pricing fully catches up to inflation. |
| **FY2027** | 2.40% | Further scale and operating leverage take hold. |
| **FY2028 - 2030** | 2.75% | A conservative long-term, mature net margin. |

### **III. Projected Cash Flows (Net Income)**

The model follows the required methodology: *Net Income for next year = (Projected Net Income from that year) + (ROIC on prior year's Net Income held as cash).* The conservative historical ROIC of **5.1%** is used.

| Year (FY End Sept) | Revenue (M USD) | Growth Rate | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) (A * 5.1%) | Adjusted Net Income (A + B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $17,400.7 | N/A | 1.51% | $261.9 | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | $18,792.8 | 8.0% | 1.80% | $338.3 | $13.4 | **$351.7** |
| **2026** | $20,108.3 | 7.0% | 2.10% | $422.3 | $17.9 | **$440.2** |
| **2027** | $21,113.7 | 5.0% | 2.40% | $506.7 | $22.4 | **$529.1** |
| **2028** | $21,958.2 | 4.0% | 2.75% | $603.8 | $27.0 | **$630.8** |
| **2029** | $22,836.5 | 4.0% | 2.75% | $628.0 | $32.3 | **$660.3** |
| **2030** | $23,750.0 | 4.0% | 2.75% | $653.1 | $33.7 | **$686.8** |

*Note: ROIC Income (B) is calculated on the *Prior Year's Adjusted Net Income*. For FY2025, it uses FY2024 Net Income from the table, but adjusted for the spin-off impact ($261.9M * 5.1% = $13.4M). For subsequent years, it is the previous year's **Adjusted Net Income** multiplied by **5.1%**.

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

#### **A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value**

| Metric | Rate | Justification (Conservative Choice) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | 10.0% | A conservative discount rate, slightly above the implied Cost of Capital for a stable, low-margin business in a mature industry. |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | 2.0% | A very conservative long-term growth rate, lower than the long-term US GDP/inflation projection, reflecting a mature and highly competitive market. |

The terminal value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, using the 2030 Adjusted Net Income as the final cash flow for the perpetuity:

*   **Terminal Value (TV) at EOY 2030** = [2030 Net Income * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
*   **TV** = [$686.8 * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   **TV** = $700.5 / 0.08 = **$8,756.3 million**

#### **B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

The Net Present Value (NPV) is the sum of the discounted 2025-2030 cash flows plus the discounted Terminal Value.

| Year | Cash Flow (M USD) | Discount Factor (1.10^n) | NPV of Cash Flow (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $351.7 | 1.10^1 = 1.100 | $319.7 |
| **2026** | $440.2 | 1.10^2 = 1.210 | $363.8 |
| **2027** | $529.1 | 1.10^3 = 1.331 | $397.5 |
| **2028** | $630.8 | 1.10^4 = 1.464 | $430.9 |
| **2029** | $660.3 | 1.10^5 = 1.611 | $409.8 |
| **2030** | $686.8 + $8,756.3 (TV) | 1.10^6 = 1.772 | $5,329.8 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$7,251.5 million** |

### **V. Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated by taking the NPV of all future cash flows, adding the current cash, and subtracting the total debt.

| Metric | Value (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $7,251.5 |
| **ADD: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $672.5 |
| **SUBTRACT: Total Debt** | ($5,560.0) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$2,364.0** |

**Fair Value per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Diluted Shares Outstanding
**Fair Value per Share** = $2,364.0 million / 267.912 million
**Fair Value per Share** = **$8.82**

---

### **VI. Justification and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **$8.82** |
| **Current Stock Price (Market)** | **~$36.00** (Assumed current price for context) |

The calculated Fair Value of **$8.82** is significantly below the assumed current market price of ~$36.00. This large discrepancy indicates that the market is making much more optimistic assumptions than this conservative DCF model.

#### **Justification for the Discrepancy**

The market's significantly higher valuation is likely predicated on the following assumptions, which are implicitly more aggressive than those used in this conservative model:

1.  **Much Higher Terminal Growth Rate (g):** The market is likely assuming that Aramark's structural improvements (post-spin focus, new supply chain initiatives, and strong net new business wins) will translate into a higher long-term growth rate. For the stock price to be $36.00, assuming the same Discount Rate and a Net Income of $686.8M in 2030, the implied terminal growth rate (g) would need to be approximately **5.4% to 6.0%**. A long-term growth rate of 5.4%-6.0% is very aggressive for a mature food service company and suggests the market believes Aramark will consistently outgrow both its competition and global GDP growth for the foreseeable future.

2.  **Higher Long-Term Net Income Margins:** Aramark's management is focused on margin expansion, and the market may be projecting a faster and higher peak Net Income Margin than the conservative **2.75%** used here. A margin closer to **4.0% - 5.0%** would significantly increase the projected Net Income and, consequently, the Terminal Value. The market may believe that the company's cost control and supply chain optimization will yield a margin comparable to some of the highest-margin competitors, which is an aggressive assumption for the capital-light, competitive nature of the FSS industry.

3.  **Lower Discount Rate (r):** The market perceives the company's cash flows as less risky than the **10.0%** discount rate used here. Given Aramark's long-term contracts and stable, utility-like business model in FSS, the market's implied discount rate may be closer to its estimated WACC of **~8.0% - 9.0%**, which would also significantly increase the NPV.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF valuation of **$8.82** suggests the stock is currently overvalued, but this is a direct result of the model's mandated highly conservative assumptions on both the long-term growth rate ($2.0\%$) and the terminal margin. The market's price reflects a strong belief in management's ability to drive structural improvements that result in a significantly higher and sustainable long-term growth rate (g > 5.0%) and/or a much higher peak profitability (Net Income Margin > 4.0%).
