### II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

Aramark's business engine is driven by three main components, as outlined in management commentary: **Client Retention**, **Base Business Growth** (volume and price), and **Net New Business**.

*   **FY 2025 Performance:** Aramark achieved organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by a record retention rate of 96.3% and unprecedented annualized Net New business of 5.6% of prior year revenue.
*   **FY 2026 Guidance:** Management has reaffirmed strong organic revenue growth guidance of **7% to 9%** and is currently outpacing its Net New Business target of 4% to 5% of prior year revenue.

**Conservative Revenue Assumptions:**

To create a conservative model, I will anchor the projections to the low end of management's guidance and then gradually decay the growth rate, assuming normalization and increased scale challenges.

| Year | Growth Component Rationale | Annual Growth Rate | Revenue Projection (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual Base)** | - | - | $18,506.00 |
| **2026** | **Management Low-End Guidance:** Use the conservative end of the 7%-9% organic growth range. | 7.0% | $19,791.42 |
| **2027** | **Post-Guidance Normalization:** Decaying from the guided high-growth year, but sustained by strong retention and continued net new wins. | 6.0% | $20,978.89 |
| **2028** | **Sustained Growth:** A conservative rate reflecting the large, stable contracts in food/support services, slightly above long-term inflation. | 5.0% | $22,027.83 |
| **2029** | **Further Decay:** Reflects market saturation in some geographies and increased competition. | 4.0% | $22,909.00 |
| **2030** | **Steady State:** A moderate, durable growth rate for a mature services business. | 3.5% | $23,710.82 |

### III. Margin Projection and Net Income Calculation

**A. Margin Analysis:**

*   **FY 2025 Net Income Margin (GAAP):** $326.39M / $18,506.00M = **1.76%**
*   **Management Guidance:** Management drove **20-25 basis points** (0.20% - 0.25%) of Adjusted Operating Income (AOI) margin expansion in FY 2025. They guided AOI growth of 12%-17% for FY 2026, suggesting continued margin improvement through higher revenue, supply chain efficiencies, and technology leverage.

**B. Net Income Margin Assumption:**

I will project a conservative, gradual improvement in the Net Income Margin based on management's stated efficiencies and operating leverage.

*   **Starting Point (FY 2025):** 1.76%
*   **Conservative Margin Expansion:** Projecting an incremental 15 basis points (0.15%) of Net Income Margin expansion per year, which is conservative compared to the AOI margin expansion seen in FY 2025. This accounts for higher interest expenses and taxes that may offset some of the operating improvements.

| Year | Revenue (A) (millions USD) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A * B) (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $18,506.00 | 1.76% | $326.39 |
| **2026** | $19,791.42 | 1.91% | $378.01 |
| **2027** | $20,978.89 | 2.06% | $431.17 |
| **2028** | $22,027.83 | 2.21% | $486.99 |
| **2029** | $22,909.00 | 2.36% | $540.65 |
| **2030** | $23,710.82 | 2.51% | $594.69 |

**C. ROIC Adjustment:**

*   **ROIC Calculation:** The valuation rule requires factoring in an additional income from the prior year's Net Income (cash) at a reasonable ROIC.
    *   **Net Income (N) / Invested Capital (IC)** is the standard calculation. Given the high debt structure, I will use a conservative ROIC reflecting the ability to generate a return on newly retained earnings.
    *   Since historical ROIC can be volatile, I will assume a conservative but reasonable **ROIC of 5.0%** for the reinvested cash, slightly above a long-term risk-free rate, reflecting the stable and defensive nature of Aramark's contracted cash flows.

| Year | Base Net Income (A) (millions USD) | Prior Year Net Income (B) (millions USD) | ROIC Income (B * 5.0%) (millions USD) | Total Net Income (A + C) (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $326.39 | N/A | N/A | $326.39 |
| **2026** | $378.01 | $326.39 | $16.32 | $394.33 |
| **2027** | $431.17 | $394.33 | $19.72 | $450.89 |
| **2028** | $486.99 | $450.89 | $22.54 | $509.53 |
| **2029** | $540.65 | $509.53 | $25.48 | $566.13 |
| **2030** | $594.69 | $566.13 | $28.31 | $623.00 |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**A. Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):**

*   **Assumption:** A **Discount Rate of 9.0%** will be used. This is a reasonable and conservative estimate for a mature, publicly traded company like Aramark, which has stable but low-margin business, a moderate risk profile, and significant debt (WACC is typically higher than a low-risk rate).

**B. Terminal Value (Maturity Rate):**

*   **Assumption:** A conservative, long-term **Maturity (Perpetual Growth) Rate of 2.0%** will be used. This assumes the company will grow slightly faster than long-term inflation and U.S. GDP, reflecting its ability to consistently win new business and increase pricing.

**C. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (using 2030 Net Income as Proxy for Free Cash Flow):**

$$Terminal Value = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$Terminal Value = \frac{\$623.00 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$635.46}{0.07} = \$9,078.00 \text{ million}$$

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) (millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0% Rate) | Present Value (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $394.33 | 0.9174 | $361.73 |
| **2027** | $450.89 | 0.8417 | $379.54 |
| **2028** | $509.53 | 0.7722 | $393.44 |
| **2029** | $566.13 | 0.7084 | $401.10 |
| **2030** | $623.00 | 0.6499 | $404.88 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | $9,078.00 | 0.6499 | $5,900.89 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | **$7,841.58** |

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Aramark (ARMK) is **$7.64**.

As of the current date (assumed to be February 17, 2026, based on the recent Q1 2026 filing), the actual market price of ARMK stock is likely to be significantly higher than this valuation.

**Justification for the Discrepancy (Market vs. Calculated Value):**

The market's valuation of ARMK is likely based on significantly more aggressive growth and margin assumptions, particularly in the Terminal Value calculation, which accounts for the vast majority of the calculated Enterprise Value.

1.  **Lower Discount Rate (WACC):** The market may be using a lower cost of capital (Discount Rate) than the conservative 9.0% assumption. A lower WACC significantly increases the NPV. *For example, an 8.0% Discount Rate with a 2.0% Maturity Rate would increase the Terminal Value by over 40%*.
2.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** A small increase in the Perpetual Growth Rate has a massive impact. The market may be expecting long-term growth closer to 3.0% or 3.5%, reflecting the company's strong net new business pipeline and ability to consistently secure new contracts (even above organic growth).
3.  **Higher Margin Trajectory:** The market is likely pricing in a faster and higher realization of the guided AOI margin expansion. The management's focus on cost discipline and supply chain efficiencies suggests a runway for substantial profitability improvement. My conservative assumption of only 15 basis points of Net Income Margin expansion may be far too low compared to market expectations, especially as the high-margin Uniform Services business has been spun off, leaving the core FSS business poised for potential margin scale.
4.  **Deleveraging Focus:** Management has a stated goal to reduce the leverage ratio below 3.0x by the end of fiscal 2026. Successful deleveraging would reduce future interest expense, directly increasing Net Income (my cash flow proxy) and reducing the total debt in the final calculation, both of which would raise the Fair Value.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF model suggests that the market is valuing Aramark not just on its immediate guidance but on a strong conviction that the company's margin expansion initiatives will continue long past 2030, and that its robust revenue growth engine (Net New Business) is structurally durable and will continue to grow at a high-single-digit pace for a longer period of time, warranting a lower risk/discount rate and a higher long-term growth rate.
