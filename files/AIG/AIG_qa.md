## Business Summary

AIG operates primarily as a global insurance provider, collecting regular payments (premiums) from a highly diversified customer base that includes major corporations worldwide seeking coverage for complex risks (B2B) and individual consumers purchasing life insurance and retirement products. The company’s core model relies on two strategies: successful underwriting, which means accurately pricing risk so that collected premiums exceed claims paid out; and robust investment management, where AIG generates significant income by investing the vast pool of premiums (known as the "float") until those claims need to be settled. Revenue is generally divided between General Insurance (covering corporate property, casualty, and specialized liabilities) and Life & Retirement Services (providing products for long-term financial security).

## Business Model Risk

The most immediate risk is underwriting failure, which occurs when unexpected, large-scale catastrophic events (such as major hurricanes or industrial accidents) cause claims to significantly exceed the premiums collected, immediately harming quarterly earnings. A persistent, long-term threat stems from AIG's massive investment portfolio: if financial markets suffer a severe downturn or if interest rates remain low for prolonged periods, the returns generated from the invested premiums may be insufficient to cover future policyholder obligations, weakening the company's financial foundation. Historically, AIG faced a near-collapse in 2008 due to massive losses related to complex investment products, proving that poor investment risk management is a systemic danger. Today, this concern is amplified by increasing regulatory scrutiny and the rising frequency and cost of natural disasters linked to climate change, making it extremely difficult for AIG to accurately price risks and maintain market position.

## Company History

This history lesson will guide you through the journey of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), from a small agency in China to a major global insurer, focusing on simple, jargon-free explanations.

---

### **A History of American International Group, Inc. (AIG)**

#### **I. The Inception (1919) and Original Goal**

1.  **The Founding Location and Year:** AIG was founded in 1919, not in New York, but in Shanghai, China, by an American named Cornelius Vander Starr.
2.  **The Original Goal:** Starr's initial company, the American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), was set up to sell insurance to foreign businesses and American expatriates living in the growing international trade hub of China.
3.  **Early Innovative Approach:** Starr’s vision was truly global from the start, a unique focus at the time that allowed him to tap into international markets and opportunities that other insurers missed.

#### **II. Growth, Expansion, and Early Tailwinds**

1.  **Geographic Expansion (The Initial Tailwind):** The company expanded rapidly, taking advantage of favorable global trends to open offices across Southeast Asia, and in 1926, its first office in the United States.
2.  **Post-War Opportunity:** After World War II, a major tailwind was the expansion into countries like Japan and Germany, where the company provided insurance for U.S. military personnel stationed overseas.
3.  **Innovative Business Structure:** In the 1960s, under new leadership, the company began selling policies through independent brokers rather than salaried agents, an innovative cost-cutting strategy that allowed them to be more competitive on price.
4.  **Formal Incorporation:** The various insurance businesses and subsidiaries were formally brought together and incorporated as American International Group, Inc. (AIG) in 1967.

#### **III. Mid-Century Headwinds and The Drive for Profit**

1.  **Political Headwinds:** In the 1970s, AIG faced a major headwind when political changes forced it to curtail or cease operations in the Middle East and parts of Southeast Asia.
2.  **The Solution Through Specialization:** To deal with these shutdowns, AIG focused on specializing, developing complex insurance products for niche industries like energy, shipping, and transportation.
3.  **Early Warning Sign (Accounting Scandal):** In the early 2000s, AIG faced a significant problem, having to pay large fines and address an accounting scandal related to unlawful practices.

#### **IV. The Great Crisis of 2008 and the Biggest Headwind**

1.  **Risky Side Business:** Before the 2008 financial crisis, AIG created a division that ventured far from core insurance into complex financial products, including **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**.
2.  **The Jargon-Free Problem (CDS):** A Credit Default Swap was essentially a promise, or "insurance policy," AIG sold to banks, agreeing to pay them if certain risky investments—like bundles of subprime home mortgages—failed or defaulted.
3.  **The Headwind Hits:** AIG was highly rated, which meant it was allowed to sell billions of dollars in these "insurance policies" without keeping enough cash in reserve to pay the claims. When the housing market collapsed and those home loans failed, AIG was suddenly facing claims for hundreds of billions of dollars, and it did not have the cash to fulfill its promises, leading to the brink of bankruptcy.
4.  **The Government Solution (Bailout):** Because AIG's failure would have triggered a catastrophic chain reaction across the entire global financial system ("too big to fail"), the U.S. government stepped in with a massive $182 billion bailout.
5.  **A Unique Outcome:** The government became the majority owner of AIG and managed the firm's stability. Through a massive effort, AIG repaid the U.S. government loan in full, plus interest, and the assistance program ultimately generated a profit for the taxpayers.

#### **V. Restructuring and Innovative Present-Day Solutions**

1.  **The Restructuring Solution:** To pay back the debt, AIG underwent a dramatic overhaul, cutting its size nearly in half by selling off major, non-core assets like its successful Asian and global life insurance units (e.g., AIA and ALICO).
2.  **Focus on Core Business (The New Goal):** Today, AIG has completed its transformation, becoming a leaner organization focused primarily on its **General Insurance** segment—insuring property, casualty, and specialty risks for large corporations and individuals globally.
3.  **Modern Risk Solution (Re-Underwriting):** The company aggressively improved its pricing and risk selection—known as "re-underwriting"—which involved raising the price for risky policies and setting stricter limits to reduce the possibility of massive, unforeseen losses.
4.  **Technology as an Innovation:** AIG has adopted cutting-edge solutions like Artificial Intelligence (AI) to speed up and improve its core insurance decisions. This technology helps underwriters assess new policy submissions and risks faster and with greater accuracy, allowing the company to avoid bad bets and improve its financial health.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of American International Group (AIG) is primarily built upon its vast global network, specialized underwriting expertise for complex risks, and a commitment to data-driven operational excellence.

***

### Analysis of the AIG Moat

#### What Makes AIG Different from Competitors and the Reason for its Growth

1.  **Unique Global Network and Scale:** AIG's most significant competitive edge is its extensive operational network, which serves clients in approximately 190 countries and jurisdictions. This scale is nearly impossible for most competitors to replicate quickly, making AIG the insurer of choice for multinational corporations that require consistent, worldwide coverage.

2.  **Specialization in Complex Risks:** The company differentiates itself by focusing on sophisticated, specialty commercial insurance products, such as professional liability, marine, aviation, and political risk. This expertise allows them to underwrite and price complex exposures that many standard insurers avoid, which was a key driver of its early and sustained growth.

3.  **Historical First-Mover Advantage:** AIG was founded in Shanghai, China, in 1919, and its original success came from being one of the first to build a meaningful international distribution system outside of the United States. This early focus on global market development allowed them to secure a dominant worldwide presence that persists today.

#### Pricing Power and Special Position in the Market

1.  **Specialized Pricing Power:** AIG has a degree of pricing power that comes from the unique nature of its specialty products and the customized solutions it provides to its clients. This is particularly true in niche areas like its Private Client Group or specific commercial casualty lines, where coverage is bespoke and not easily commoditized.

2.  **Disciplined Underwriting and Risk Management:** The company has implemented a strategic shift toward strict underwriting discipline, which is evidenced by its significantly improved combined ratio and consistent underwriting profit in recent years. This financial rigor, combined with sophisticated risk modeling, enables them to manage their book of business more profitably than less disciplined competitors.

3.  **Strategic Reinsurance as a Margin Protector:** AIG's heavy use of reinsurance is a strategic advantage that provides predictability and volatility containment for major losses. By transferring a portion of its risk, the company protects its margins, especially when general market rates decline, a benefit that competitors with higher self-retention may lack.

#### Displacement Risk and Customer/Contract Stickiness

1.  **Difficulty of Displacement:** While any insurer can be displaced with enough capital, AIG's displacement is exceptionally difficult due to its global licensing and regulatory structure in numerous jurisdictions. Building a comparable, globally compliant network and the deep, decades-long expertise for specialized risk is a time-consuming and expensive barrier for new entrants.

2.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** Contracts for large commercial and specialty risks are generally very sticky and recurring. Switching insurers for a multinational corporation involves significant administrative friction, especially when the policy is a customized program that includes advanced risk consulting and global claims handling.

3.  **No Strong Network Effect (Traditional):** Insurance does not have a classic "network effect" like a social media platform, where each new user makes the product more valuable to every existing user. However, AIG's comprehensive global network acts as a powerful **distribution advantage** that continually attracts large multinational clients who need integrated, global services.

#### Moat-Building Activities (Past and Present)

1.  **Investment in Technology and Data:** The company is aggressively investing in and deploying advanced technology, including **AI, data analytics, and GenAI**, to enhance its moat. This technology is focused on improving the precision and efficiency of its core business, underwriting, and on streamlining its claims management process.

2.  **Constant Innovation for Specialized Solutions:** AIG must constantly innovate to maintain its edge, not by creating an entirely new product category, but by developing tailored solutions for evolving and complex risks like cyber security and political instability.

3.  **Strategic Focus and Divestiture:** The company has strengthened its focus by divesting non-core businesses, most notably spinning off its life and retirement division, Corebridge Financial. This realignment makes AIG a more focused property and casualty insurer, allowing for better deployment of capital and further concentration on its profitable specialty commercial lines.

4.  **Growth in Net Investment Income (NII)**
    *   Higher global interest rates are increasing the income AIG earns from investing its collected premiums (float), driving overall profitability growth.
    *   Management has noted a significant increase in NII, driven by higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturity securities and short-term investment income.

---

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **The Simplified, Focused "Pure-Play" Insurance Structure**
    *   The multi-year process of separating the Life & Retirement business (Corebridge Financial) is nearing completion, which greatly simplifies AIG's balance sheet and income statement.
    *   Management emphasizes this strategic step positions AIG as a more focused property and casualty (P&C) insurer, reducing the volatility associated with life insurance accounting.
    
2.  **Achievement of Financial Targets and De-risking**
    *   A primary long-term goal mentioned by management is achieving a $\text{10%}$ or greater Return on Common Equity (ROCE), which, if realized, indicates sustained, high profitability.
    *   The company's use of robust reinsurance and a conservative approach to catastrophe risk helps stabilize results and improves its credit ratings, which supports long-term growth confidence.
    
3.  **Disciplined Growth in Commercial Lines**
    *   AIG is focusing on targeted, profitable growth in its Global Commercial Lines, with record new business and strong client retention.
    *   Management sees "multiple avenues for expansion in casualty and specialty" while maintaining disciplined risk-adjusted returns, which is key for sustainable long-term earnings.

## Management Record

This analysis focuses on the management of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), with a particular emphasis on its current leadership and the multi-year transformation for investors.

### I. Current CEO and Management: Peter Zaffino

1.  **CEO Background and Credentials:** Peter Zaffino has over 30 years of insurance and reinsurance industry experience, including executive roles at Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC), where he served as CEO of Marsh and President & CEO of Guy Carpenter.
2.  **Ascension and Tenure:** Zaffino joined AIG in 2017 as Global Chief Operating Officer (COO) under then-CEO Brian Duperreault, was promoted to CEO in March 2021, and became Chairman of the Board in January 2022.
3.  **Core Management Team:** The current executive team, which has an average tenure of around 3.3 years, is considered stable and aligned with Zaffino's transformation strategy, focusing on underwriting discipline and operational excellence.

### II. Track Record and Delivery of Promises (Zaffino Era)

4.  **Strategic Deliverables (Key Decisions):** Zaffino’s signature achievement is the successful separation of AIG’s Life and Retirement business, which was completed through the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Corebridge Financial in 2022, a major step in transforming AIG into a focused General Insurance company.
5.  **Shareholder Value Creation:** Since Zaffino became CEO, the combined market capitalization of AIG and Corebridge Financial has increased significantly, outperforming the S&P 500 and demonstrating successful execution of a complex multi-year strategy.
6.  **Underwriting Turnaround:** Management has successfully restored AIG’s underwriting profitability through a data-driven approach, reducing the General Insurance combined ratio from 117.3% in 2017 to 91.8% in 2024, a critical measure of underwriting excellence.
7.  **Risk and Volatility Reduction:** A key success has been a major reduction in volatility; AIG’s share of industry catastrophe losses dropped significantly, and the company has become one of the most predictable companies in its peer group.
8.  **Financial and Capital Discipline:** The company has executed a disciplined capital management plan, returning substantial capital to shareholders, including $8.1 billion in 2024 through share repurchases and dividends.
9.  **Expense Management:** Management has delivered on the "AIG Next" initiative, achieving over $530 million in annual run rate expense savings ahead of schedule.

### III. History and Management Changes

10. **Post-Crisis Legacy:** AIG’s history is marked by a tumultuous period following the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a $182 billion U.S. government bailout and over a decade of restructuring and multiple CEO changes.
11. **Greenberg's Departure:** A critical turning point came in 2005 when long-time CEO Maurice "Hank" Greenberg was forced to resign due to investigations into accounting irregularities, which began a period of instability.
12. **The Duperreault-Zaffino Transition (2017-2021):** Brian Duperreault, an industry veteran, was hired in 2017 to begin the turnaround, focusing on underwriting discipline and structural reorganization; he hired Zaffino as his COO and set the stage for Zaffino's ultimate promotion to CEO, which was an expected succession plan.
13. **Strategic Rationale for Change:** The multi-CEO turnover since 2005 was primarily aimed at streamlining operations, improving its risk profile, and restoring AIG's reputation after the government bailout and shedding its "Systemically Important Financial Institution" (SIFI) designation, which Duperreault achieved in 2017.

### IV. Future Strategy and Vision

14. **Vision and Strategic Focus:** AIG's primary vision is to be a top-performing, modern, and client-centric global General Insurance company, essentially a near pure-play specialty insurer after the Corebridge spin-off.

## Management Incentive

### American International Group, Inc. (AIG) Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

The analysis is based on the most recent publicly available information, primarily AIG's 2024 Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), which details the management's compensation structure and beneficial ownership.

#### Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors

1.  **Low Aggregate Ownership:** The combined beneficial ownership of all current directors and executive officers as a group (24 individuals) is less than **one percent (\*%)** of AIG's common stock as of January 31, 2024. This is generally considered a low level of direct insider ownership in absolute terms.
2.  **Individual CEO Ownership:** The CEO, Peter Zaffino, directly owns 0.11% of the company's shares. (Note: The CEO's shares subject to options, if exercised within 60 days, would be significantly higher).
3.  **Conclusion on Ownership (Higher the Better):** The *direct* beneficial ownership by the management and the board is very low in percentage terms, suggesting a lack of significant personal capital-at-risk compared to large institutional shareholders.

#### Executive Compensation Structure

1.  **High-Risk/High-Reward Pay Mix:** The compensation for the Named Executive Officers (NEOs), especially the CEO, is heavily weighted toward variable, performance-based pay, with a very small base salary component. For the CEO, 100% of his 2023 incentive-based compensation was in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs) and stock options.
2.  **Short-Term Incentive (STI) Metrics:** The annual cash incentive (STI) payouts are based on a combination of quantitative financial objectives and individual performance goals.
3.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Metrics and Vehicles:** The LTI program utilizes Performance Share Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and Stock Options with a typical three-year vesting period.
    *   **Performance Metrics:** Key performance-based metrics are used for PSUs, with the goal of aligning executive focus with long-term shareholder value. The LTI program's core metrics focus on financial results and long-term growth, with **Growth in Book Value per Share** serving as the basis for a metric and the company working toward an **Adjusted Return on Common Equity target of 10% plus**.
4.  **Stock Ownership Guidelines (Key Alignment Feature):** A strong mechanism exists to enforce "owner mentality." The CEO is required to hold stock valued at **five times (5x) their base salary**, and other executive officers at three times (3x). Executives must retain 50% of the net shares received from equity awards until they meet this substantial ownership threshold, which forces them to accumulate and hold significant value in company stock.
5.  **Risk Mitigation Policies:** The company enforces anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies, preventing executives from offsetting or gambling on the value of their AIG stock, which is a strong corporate governance practice that locks in their exposure to shareholder returns.

#### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

AIG's incentive and compensation structure is **designed to align management's interests with those of the shareholders** through a clear pay-for-performance model.

1.  **Alignment with Shareholders (Yes, Sufficient Incentive):** The structure largely incentivizes management to act in the shareholders' interest because the vast majority (over 90%) of executive compensation is **variable and at-risk**, contingent on achieving multi-year financial goals like improved profitability (underwriting performance), efficient expense management, and growth in Book Value/Return on Equity.
2.  **Mitigation of "Lining Their Own Pockets" (Mitigated):** While the low aggregate direct ownership is a weakness, the high **5x base salary stock ownership requirement** for the CEO and the requirement to retain shares until that level is met acts as a long-term retention and alignment tool, effectively forcing them to "act like owners" and linking a significant portion of their total wealth to the performance of AIG's stock price. The multi-year vesting for LTIP awards and anti-hedging policies further discourages short-term manipulation of financial results.

## Long Thesis

AIG has successfully completed its painful, decade-long transformation. It is now a much simpler, highly focused company specializing in insuring complex, hard-to-cover risks for global corporations. In the near term, the stock will be boosted because management is using profits, higher interest income, and proceeds from asset sales to aggressively buy back shares. In the long term, the company is expected to become a consistent, top-performing insurer due to improved data and technology that allows them to price risks far more accurately than competitors. This disciplined approach leverages AIG's unique global reach and specialty expertise, leading to stable, high profits and achieving the management's target of a 10% or greater return on equity.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumptions are that management maintains its strict discipline, avoiding the risky, non-core ventures that led to past failures. It is also assumed that global interest rates remain high enough to support strong investment income from AIG's massive cash reserves. Critically, the company must accurately predict and manage catastrophic losses (like major hurricanes or cyber attacks), ensuring that claims paid do not exceed the collected premiums, thereby preserving the current profitable underwriting results.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the potential holes and faults in the bullish thesis for American International Group, Inc. (AIG), forming the basis for a bearish counter-argument.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

#### 1. Over-reliance on Catastrophe (CAT) Management and High Volatility
*   **Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The thesis assumes the company can "accurately predict and manage catastrophic losses." However, recent results show that even after de-risking, AIG remains highly susceptible to significant, single-event volatility.
*   **Corroborating Fact:** A single major event, such as the California wildfires, caused a substantial spike in catastrophe-related charges ($525 million in one recent quarter) which directly resulted in a 59% drop in General Insurance underwriting income year-over-year. This underscores that major catastrophe losses are an immediate and severe threat to the company's profitability and can derail the narrative of achieving "stable, high profits."

#### 2. Risk of Reintroducing Complexity Through Investment Strategy
*   **Thesis Assumption Flaw:** The thesis assumes "management maintains its strict discipline, avoiding the risky, non-core ventures that led to past failures," and emphasizes AIG as a "simpler, highly focused company."
*   **Corroborating Fact:** To boost investment income, AIG has announced plans to significantly increase the allocation of its General Insurance investment portfolio to **private assets**, specifically private credit (from 8% to 12%-15%) and private equity (from 5% to 6%-8%). This move into less liquid, more complex investment categories could be viewed as a return to greater complexity and risk appetite outside of core underwriting, which runs counter to the "simpler, highly focused" narrative.

#### 3. Transient Nature of Technology/Data Competitive Advantage
*   **Thesis Flaw:** The thesis posits that the company will achieve "top-performing" status due to a unique competitive advantage from "improved data and technology."
*   **Corroborating Fact:** While AIG is heavily investing in AI and data analytics and has a partnership with Anthropic, the search results clearly state that the shift toward digital transformation and AI is a **competitive imperative** for the entire insurance industry, with "peer companies" also increasingly deploying InsurTech solutions. This suggests that AIG's technological advancements are likely necessary for parity, not a source of a long-term, unassailable competitive advantage over peers in the specialty insurance market.

#### 4. Unsustainable Dependency on Capital Management for EPS Growth
*   **Thesis Flaw:** The near-term stock boost is attributed to aggressive share repurchases, but the long-term thesis relies on "consistent... stable, high profits."
*   **Corroborating Fact:** AIG returned $8.1 billion in capital in a recent year, with $6.6 billion through massive share repurchases, substantially reducing the share count. While this mechanically boosts Earnings Per Share (EPS), it raises the question of whether AIG can generate the necessary *underlying* business growth to sustain a 10%+ Return on Equity (ROE) once the excess capital is exhausted or if a large portion of the recent EPS growth is simply a one-time benefit from de-consolidation proceeds being spent on buybacks.

### Bear Case Thesis

The bear case thesis holds that AIG’s transformation is real, but its premium valuation is unwarranted because the company's core profitability remains highly exposed to volatility and its "competitive advantages" are not unique or sustainable.

1.  **Underwriting Volatility Remains a Systemic Risk:** Despite a reduced risk profile, AIG’s underwriting results are still prone to significant quarter-to-quarter volatility from large catastrophic losses, as evidenced by a recent Q1 underwriting income drop of 59% due to one-time CAT events. This instability makes the "consistent, top-performing insurer" target unreliable.
2.  **Investment Strategy Undermines Simplicity:** The strategic increase in allocation to less liquid, private credit and equity assets to chase higher investment income reintroduces complexity and potential illiquidity risk to the balance sheet, contradicting the post-transformation narrative of a simpler, highly focused entity.
3.  **Lack of Differentiated Edge in Specialty Insurance:** The company's touted data and technology improvements are an industry-wide trend and will not provide a *unique* advantage over sophisticated global competitors who are making similar, necessary investments. This will force AIG to compete primarily on price in a cyclical market, pressuring long-term underwriting margins.
4.  **Capital Return Overstates Core Growth:** Recent EPS growth is heavily skewed by the immediate mechanical benefit of aggressive share repurchases funded by asset sales (like Corebridge Financial deconsolidation). Once this excess capital is deployed, the stock will struggle to grow without consistently stronger underlying premium growth and underwriting results, which the persistent CAT volatility and aggressive competition make difficult to achieve.
5.  **Return on Equity (ROE) Targets are Fragile:** The 10%+ ROE target is highly susceptible to being missed due to increased severity and frequency of CAT events (which industry losses continue to show are increasing), or by adverse development in prior-year loss reserves (a persistent historical issue for AIG).

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis already completed, the next steps should focus on quantifying AIG's transformation success, specifically by benchmarking its performance against its closest peers and gaining clarity on the long-term sustainability of its financial targets and capital structure.

Here are the most important questions and areas to investigate next:

### **I. Quantitative Benchmarking: Is AIG's Performance Truly Best-in-Class?**

1.  **Peer Comparison on Underwriting Profitability:**
    *   **Question:** How does AIG's key operational metric, the General Insurance Accident Year Combined Ratio, as adjusted (**AYCR of 87.8% - 88.4%** in Q1/Q2 2025) compare to its direct specialty and commercial insurance rivals (e.g., Chubb, Travelers, Cincinnati Financial, AXIS Capital)?
    *   *Why it matters:* This ratio (which excludes prior-year development and cat losses) is the purest measure of underwriting skill. If AIG's ratio is average, its "specialization" moat is weaker than claimed.

2.  **Valuation Relative to Peers (The "Is it Cheap?" Test):**
    *   **Question:** How do AIG's current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and Price-to-Book Value (P/B, or Adjusted Tangible Book Value) ratios stack up against its peer group?
    *   *Why it matters:* Analysts have a "Moderate Buy" to "Hold" consensus with an average target of around **\$87-\$88**. A low valuation (e.g., low P/B or P/E) would support the Long Thesis that the market has not yet recognized the full value of the turnaround.

### **II. Risk Management and Capital Sustainability**

3.  **Detailed Scrutiny of Private Asset Allocation:**
    *   **Question:** What is the precise, current (as of the most recent filing) percentage allocation of the General Insurance investment portfolio to **Private Credit and Private Equity**? The bear case hinges on this re-introduction of complexity and illiquidity risk.
    *   *Why it matters:* While management has stated plans to increase this allocation, verifying the current amount and getting an investor presentation on the risk-mitigation strategy for this illiquid asset class is crucial for assessing the long-term risk appetite.

4.  **Sustainability of Share Repurchase Program:**
    *   **Question:** After the majority of the proceeds from the Corebridge Financial spin-off have been deployed for buybacks (AIG's ownership is now 21%), what is the new, organic source of capital to fund the substantial share repurchases and dividend increases that are boosting the stock?
    *   *Why it matters:* If future buybacks rely solely on core earnings (which are exposed to CAT volatility), the future EPS growth from capital management will slow down significantly, pressuring the stock price.

### **III. Underwriting Volatility and Future Growth**

5.  **Quantifying Catastrophe Volatility (The Bear Case Driver):**
    *   **Question:** What is the company's stated, forward-looking guidance (in dollars or as a percentage of the combined ratio) for expected annual catastrophe losses, and how does this exposure compare to its peer group?
    *   *Why it matters:* The Q1 2025 combined ratio was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses, proving this is still the greatest risk. The analysis needs a better understanding of the *expected* volatility under the new, de-risked structure.

6.  **Specific Growth Drivers by Line of Business:**
    *   **Question:** Which specific lines of business within Global Commercial (e.g., Cyber, U.S. Excess Casualty, Marine) are delivering the highest profitable growth in Net Premiums Written (NPW) and are expected to continue driving this growth over the next 12-24 months?
    *   *Why it matters:* AIG's overall NPW growth is strong (8-10% in Commercial), but the long-term thesis relies on growth in the *most profitable, specialized* segments, which must be identified and verified.
