## Business Summary

Hertz primarily operates as a major car rental company, generating revenue by renting out a massive fleet of vehicles for short periods, usually at airport locations and neighborhood branches globally. Its customer base is split between leisure travelers (tourists) and corporate clients (business travelers), with operations focused heavily in North America and Europe. The core business model relies on continually buying new vehicles, renting them out for a few months or years, and then selling them as used cars, meaning profitability hinges on managing the cost of the fleet and accurately predicting the price they can get when they resell the vehicles.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk to Hertz is residual value risk, which is the unpredictable fluctuation in the price they receive when selling their used rental cars. If the market for used cars declines quickly, as it has during past economic downturns, the company suffers major losses on every vehicle they sell. Currently, a substantial concern is the integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs); Hertz has faced high costs related to EV damage, complex repairs, and rapid depreciation of these assets, forcing them to take large financial write-downs. Long-term risks include intense competition, especially from low-cost rivals and ride-sharing services that limit Hertz’s ability to raise rental prices, and the risk that rising interest rates make it increasingly expensive for the company to finance the hundreds of thousands of vehicles needed to maintain its fleet.

## Company History

Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) is one of the world's largest vehicle rental companies, with a history that spans over a century, marked by pioneering innovations and dramatic financial challenges.

### The Inception and Founding Goal (1918-1920s)

1.  **Founding Vision:** The company was founded in 1918 in Chicago by a 22-year-old entrepreneur named Walter L. Jacobs, who started a small car rental operation called "Rent-a-Car Inc."
2.  **Initial Goal:** His goal was simple: to offer accessible transportation to the public by providing them with a way to drive a car without the burden of owning one, starting with a modest fleet of a dozen Ford Model T cars.
3.  **The Name Change:** The business was a success, expanding to 600 cars within five years, which drew the interest of John D. Hertz, who was already the owner of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Hertz purchased the company in 1923 and renamed it the Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, though Jacobs remained the CEO.

### Early Innovations and Growth (1920s–1950s)

4.  **Pioneering Solutions:** Early on, the company introduced innovative services that were crucial to the industry's growth, such as the first rental car charge card in 1926.
5.  **Capitalizing on Air Travel (Tailwind):** Hertz was one of the first companies to recognize the growth of air travel as a major tailwind, opening the nation's first airport car rental office at Chicago's Midway Airport in 1932. This strategic move connected air passengers directly with ground transportation.
6.  **The One-Way Trip Solution:** In 1933, the company solved a major customer problem by introducing the first one-way rental option, allowing people to rent a car in one city and drop it off in another, which greatly increased the flexibility and use of car rentals.
7.  **Corporate Flips (Headwind/Opportunity):** The company navigated several ownership changes early on, being acquired by General Motors in 1926, repurchased by John Hertz in 1953, and then going public in 1954, demonstrating its resilience and constant repositioning.

### Modern Expansion and The Big Crisis (1960s–2021)

8.  **Global Expansion:** Hertz continued its global expansion throughout the mid-20th century and, by the 1980s, had nearly 400,000 cars and trucks operating in 120 countries, establishing itself as a dominant worldwide brand.
9.  **The COVID-19 Headwind:** A major headwind hit the company in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented, sharp decline in global travel and rental demand. This sudden, severe lack of revenue, combined with a heavy debt load, forced Hertz to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020.
10. **The Great Reset (Innovative Solution):** The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, receiving over $\$5.9$ billion in new capital and significantly restructuring its finances by reducing corporate debt. This action was a major reset, allowing Hertz to start fresh and focus on future investments.

### Present-Day Challenges and Strategic Pivot (2022–Present)

11. **The EV Gamble (Headwind/Problem):** Post-restructuring, Hertz launched a major new strategy—a large commitment to electric vehicles (EVs) with plans for a significant fleet, hoping to capture the growing trend toward sustainable mobility. However, this proved to be a severe headwind as the vehicles experienced higher-than-expected maintenance costs and faster depreciation in value than traditional cars.
12. **The Strategic Pivot (New Solution):** In 2024, Hertz reversed this strategy, deciding to sell off tens of thousands of EVs and reinvesting the money into more traditional, gasoline-powered vehicles to better align with customer demand and manage fleet costs.
13. **Current Goal and Business Model:** Today, the core business remains a global mobility solutions provider, operating its namesake brand along with Dollar and Thrifty. Their current strategic focus, the "Back-to-Basics Roadmap," emphasizes disciplined fleet management—the "Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right" strategy—to maximize the value of their vehicles and return to financial stability.
14. **Revenue Diversification:** A key part of the current model is maximizing the vehicle lifecycle; besides rental fees, the company also generates substantial revenue through *Hertz Car Sales*, where they sell their used rental cars directly to consumers.

## Moat Analysis

The "moat" of a car rental company like Hertz is not based on a unique, secret technology but on its massive scale and decades-long investment in a global physical network. The business is fundamentally capital-intensive and operations-focused, which creates high barriers to entry.

***

### Analysis of Hertz's Competitive Moat and Differentiation

#### **1. Core Moat: Global Network and Brand**

*   **Global Footprint:** Hertz's most significant advantage is its extensive network of rental locations worldwide, particularly at major airports, which are prime, difficult-to-acquire real estate spots.
*   **Brand Recognition:** The company's nearly century-old, globally recognized brand name provides a level of trust and familiarity for both business and leisure travelers that newer competitors cannot easily replicate.
*   **Scale and Purchasing Power:** As one of the largest players, Hertz buys vehicles in bulk (billions of dollars worth annually), giving it significant negotiating leverage with car manufacturers for favorable pricing and terms.

#### **2. Differentiation and Special Position in the Market**

*   **Product Differentiation is Low:** The core product—renting a car—is very similar across major competitors like Avis and Enterprise, which means the rivalry in the industry is often intense and based on price.
*   **Targeted Segments:** Hertz differentiates itself by targeting the premium, frequent-traveler segment, while also operating cost-conscious brands like Dollar and Thrifty to appeal to other customer segments.
*   **Customer Experience Innovation:** Differentiation is achieved through features that save frequent customers time, such as the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program and the Hertz Ultimate Choice, which allows members to skip the counter and choose their own vehicle.

#### **3. Pricing Power and Customer Relationships**

*   **Limited Pricing Power:** Hertz generally has limited pricing power with the average customer, especially leisure travelers, who are highly price-sensitive and can easily compare rates and switch providers.
*   **Recurring/Sticky Customers:** Customer relationships are a mix of one-time and recurring. Frequent travelers who are part of the *Hertz Gold Plus Rewards* program represent sticky, recurring revenue, as the program offers valuable, expedited service and rewards that encourage them to stay.
*   **Corporate Contracts:** Large corporate contracts and long-term partnerships with airlines, hotels, and travel agencies provide a stable, recurring revenue stream and a degree of customer stickiness.

#### **4. Historical Growth and Displacement Difficulty**

*   **Reason for Growth:** Hertz grew into a global giant by being an early mover in establishing an extensive, prime physical network, especially at key airport locations, and consistently investing in its brand reputation over decades.
*   **Displacement Difficulty:** Displacement is difficult but not impossible. The immense barrier is the high capital needed to acquire and maintain a massive, modern fleet (billions of dollars) and the regulatory/logistical challenge of securing high-value airport locations.
*   **Role of Capital:** While a competitor with more capital could theoretically enter, they would face high initial costs and years of effort to replicate the existing operational scale and global footprint of Hertz.

#### **5. Network Effects, R&D, and Innovation**

*   **Network Advantage (Scale, not Digital Network Effect):** The primary advantage is *density* and *scale*, not a classic digital network effect (where each new user makes the product instantly more valuable to every other user). A large number of locations and fleet size makes the service more valuable to travelers by increasing availability and convenience. Partnerships with airlines/hotels act as an *indirect* network by bundling services.
*   **R&D and Innovation:** Hertz does not invest heavily in traditional, product-development R&D. Instead, its focus is on **operational and customer service innovation** to maintain its edge.
*   **Creating the Moat:** The company ensures a solid moat by constantly focusing on:
    *   **Fleet Management:** Quickly rotating its fleet to offer newer, appealing vehicles, which also helps maximize the residual value when the car is sold.
    *   **Technology Investment:** Enhancing its digital platform, mobile apps, and self-service kiosks to simplify the customer's rental experience and streamline operations.
    *   **Loyalty Programs:** Continually investing in its rewards program to keep the most frequent, high-value customers in its ecosystem.

## Catalyst Analysis

Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) is undergoing a significant transformation, with its catalysts primarily focused on improving operational efficiency and fleet management to turn around profitability.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Fleet Depreciation Improvement:** Management is aggressively rotating its fleet to reduce costs, aiming for a "North Star" Depreciation Per Unit (DPU) metric in the low $300 range, a critical financial lever.
2.  **Return to Profitability:** The company is guiding for a financial turnaround, expecting a sizable positive Adjusted Corporate EBITDA profit in the third quarter of 2025, following a positive EBITDA result in Q2 2025—the first in seven quarters.
3.  **Operational Cost Discipline:** Management expects Direct Operating Expenses (DOE) plus Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) unit costs to be flat to down year-over-year in 2025, even with a smaller fleet, indicating better operational efficiency.
4.  **Strategic Used Car Sales:** New partnerships, such as one with Amazon Autos, and the launch of a fully online car-buying marketplace ("Hertz Car Sales") are expected to increase retail vehicle sales and better realize residual values on sold vehicles.

### Long-Term Catalysts (2+ Years)

1.  **Long-Term Profit Target:** Management has explicitly stated its confidence in achieving an Adjusted Corporate EBITDA of **$1 billion by 2027**, driven by its core strategy pillars.
2.  **Sustained Fleet and Cost Targets:** The strategy's foundation is built on achieving and sustaining key targets: DPU below $300, Revenue Per Unit (RPU) above $1,500, and DOE per day in the low $30s, which management believes can unlock the $1 billion EBITDA goal.
3.  **Revenue and Demand Optimization:** The company is focusing on "sweating the assets" to increase utilization, driving a greater mix of high Revenue Per Day (RPD) segments, and leveraging technology for dynamic pricing of value-added services.
4.  **Benefits of New Leadership:** The recent appointment of new leadership is seen as a driver for transformation and a renewed focus on "getting back to the basics: operational excellence and unmatched customer service," which are the springboards for value creation.

### Management Strategy and Commentary (from Recent Earnings Calls)

Management's strategy is based on three building blocks: **Fleet, Revenue, and Cost Management.**

*   **CEO Gil West** emphasizes that "our priority is getting back to the basics, operational excellence and unmatched customer service, and using these springboards for value creation and earnings growth." He also stresses that the transformation is a "gradual progression" but remains "incredibly bullish about the future of Hertz."
*   **CFO Scott Haralson** highlights that the core progress is driven by "disciplined fleet management, revenue optimization and rigorous cost management," which are the "fundamentals for long-term durable profitability."
*   The goal for fleet management is simple: "to limit the difference between what we buy a car for and what we sell it for," with the North Star DPU metric being the ultimate measure of success.

## Management Record

The management of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) has been characterized by significant turnover and bold, high-risk strategic decisions in recent years, particularly following its emergence from bankruptcy.

### 1. Current CEO and Recent Management Transition

1.  **Current CEO Background and Appointment:** Gil West assumed the role of CEO on April 1, 2024, replacing Stephen Scherr. West's background is strongly operational, including previous roles as Chief Operating Officer at Delta Air Lines and GM's Cruise autonomous vehicle unit, suggesting a focus on execution and efficiency.
2.  **High Management Turnover:** The company has experienced instability at the top, with Gil West becoming the fifth CEO in seven years, and the company also replacing its Chief Financial Officer multiple times in a short period since exiting bankruptcy in 2021.

### 2. Previous CEO Performance and Track Record (Stephen Scherr)

1.  **Leadership & Background:** Stephen Scherr, who led Hertz from 2022 until March 2024, came from a financial background, having spent nearly three decades at Goldman Sachs.
2.  **Key Strategic Decision (EV Bet):** Scherr championed an ambitious expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) strategy, which began with a major order of 100,000 Teslas before his tenure but was significantly expanded under his leadership with orders from General Motors and Polestar.
3.  **Failure to Deliver Value:** The large EV push proved unsuccessful due to higher-than-anticipated repair costs and lower-than-expected demand for EV rentals, culminating in a significant financial reversal. This failure was a major factor in the board's decision to replace him and the company to announce the sale of approximately 20,000 EVs from its U.S. fleet.
4.  **Consequence of the EV Strategy:** The failed EV strategy led to high write-downs and the company reporting its biggest quarterly loss since 2020 shortly before Scherr's departure, suggesting a significant misstep in capital allocation and operational planning.

### 3. Management Changes Post-Bankruptcy

1.  **Bankruptcy Context:** Previous CEO Paul Stone was at the helm when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020, following a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-existing industry slowdowns.
2.  **Emergence and Interim Leadership:** Hertz emerged from bankruptcy in mid-2021 with new funding and subsequently appointed former Ford chief Mark Fields as interim CEO in October 2021. This change was framed as part of a vision to create an "all-new Hertz" by combining its brand strength with new technology.

### 4. Future Strategy and Vision Under New Management

1.  **Strategic Vision:** Hertz's long-term vision is to be the "first-choice brand for vehicle and equipment rental/leasing and total mobility solutions," aspiring to market leadership beyond traditional car rentals.
2.  **Current Strategy Focus ("Back-to-Basics"):** The immediate strategy is a "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" focusing on core operational excellence, including disciplined fleet management, maximizing revenue, and rigorous cost control.
3.  **New Fleet Management Approach:** This includes a "Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right" strategy to optimize fleet composition, balancing traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with a smaller, more disciplined EV adoption, which has already led to a reduction in vehicle depreciation per unit.
4.  **Financial Targets and Modernization:** The new management is targeting a long-term goal of achieving **\$1 billion in adjusted EBITDA by 2027**, supported by investments in digital transformation, including AI-driven sales and modernizing revenue management systems.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.'s (HTZ) most recent compensation and governance disclosures, the management incentive and compensation structure is designed with multiple mechanisms to align the interests of executives with those of the shareholders.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership (Structural Alignment):** A highly concentrated ownership structure exists, with key investment entities (CK Amarillo, associated with Knighthead Capital and Certares Management) beneficially owning approximately 59% of the common stock as of early 2025. This large block of ownership by affiliated directors/investors inherently creates a strong incentive for long-term value creation.

2.  **Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines (High Target):** Hertz maintains robust stock ownership guidelines for its Named Executive Officers (NEOs), requiring the CEO to hold shares valued at **5 times** (5x) their annual base salary and other Executive Vice Presidents to hold **3 times** (3x) their base salary.

3.  **Restriction on Stock Sales (Holding Period):** Until the executive meets their target ownership level, they are generally restricted from selling more than 50% of the net shares they receive upon the vesting or exercise of equity awards. This strongly encourages executives to maintain a significant, long-term stake in the company.

4.  **Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy (Risk Alignment):** The company's Insider Trading Policy explicitly prohibits employees and directors from pledging company shares or entering into any type of arrangement that hedges against a decrease in the market value of the common stock. This prevents managers from insulating themselves from poor stock performance, ensuring they bear the same market risk as other shareholders.

5.  **Performance-Based Compensation Metrics (Balanced Focus):** Executive compensation is tied to a mix of financial, operational, and stock-based metrics. Key measures used for incentive compensation include **Adjusted Corporate EBITDA** (financial profitability), **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** (stock price performance), **DOE & SGA Per Transaction Day** (cost/operational efficiency), and **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** (customer satisfaction).

6.  **Long-Term Incentive Structure (Sustained Stock Price):** A significant portion of the compensation is delivered through long-term equity, such as performance-based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) for the CEO, which are earned only if the company's stock price achieves a sustained level (e.g., a 90-day volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, exceeding a specific target) and is subject to a three-year vesting schedule. This requires *sustained* stock performance, not just a short-term spike.

### **Conclusion**

**Hertz's management has sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

The overall compensation and governance structure is strongly weighted toward shareholder alignment. The mandatory high-level of insider stock ownership (5x and 3x salary), combined with the prohibition on hedging or pledging shares, forces executives to have their personal wealth tied directly to the long-term stock performance. Furthermore, tying both short- and long-term incentives to metrics like *Adjusted EBITDA, cost efficiency*, and *Total Shareholder Return* ensures that compensation rewards the creation of both operational and market value for the shareholders. The presence of a major, concentrated ownership group also acts as an external check, reinforcing management's focus on long-term stock value.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of recent stock data and technical indicators for Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ), here is a summary of its price history and current technical standing:

1.  **52-Week Low Calculation:** With a 52-week low of **\$2.77** and a recent closing price of approximately **\$5.10**, the stock is currently trading around **84.1%** above its 52-week low.
    *   *(Calculation note: (\$5.10 - \$2.77) / \$2.77 $\approx$ 0.841, or 84.1%). One source phrased this as the current price being 184.12% "away" from the 52-week low.*

2.  **Recent Price Trend (Big Drop):** HTZ experienced significant negative momentum in the few months leading up to the end of October 2025, with the stock price dropping by approximately **29.9%** over the three-month period.

3.  **Explanation for Drops:** The company's financial struggles and stock volatility are historically linked to a strategy that included buying expensive vehicles during the pandemic and a major commitment to electric vehicles (EVs), which ultimately "backfired" and contributed to a massive overall decline of over 90% from its all-time high in 2021.

4.  **Significant Stock Jumps:** The stock has seen occasional surges, such as a **50% year-to-date rally** noted in April 2025, which was driven by what was reported as strong earnings and a financial turnaround at the time. A more recent jump occurred when Hertz announced a partnership with **Amazon Autos** to sell its pre-owned rental vehicles online.

5.  **Technical Analysis and "Trading Low":** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for HTZ is around **44**, which technically suggests a **neutral reading**, meaning the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. However, given the substantial **30% drop** over the last three months, the stock is currently in a downtrend from its recent highs, which some investors might view as "trading low" compared to its 52-week high of **\$9.39**.

6.  **Analyst Consensus:** The overall consensus rating from analysts remains generally cautious, with the average recommendation being a **"Hold,"** based on a mix of Buy, Hold, and Sell ratings.

## Long Thesis

Hertz is executing a rapid turnaround following the failed, costly electric vehicle (EV) experiment. The new leadership has pivoted to a disciplined, 'back-to-basics' strategy focused on maximizing the value of its massive fleet. Near term, selling off expensive EVs and optimizing the purchase and resale of traditional cars will drastically lower depreciation costs—the company's main financial drain—leading to a return to core profitability in 2025. Long term, Hertz leverages its critical assets: a century-old brand and an irreplaceable global network of prime airport locations. By focusing on operational efficiency, disciplined capital spending, and using better technology for dynamic pricing, the company is poised to achieve its goal of generating $1 billion in core earnings by 2027, unlocking significant value from its dominant market position.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the new CEO and management team can flawlessly execute the operational turnaround, hitting aggressive cost-cutting targets like consistently lowering vehicle depreciation per unit. Second, the thesis requires a stable or growing global travel market; the bull case falls apart if a major recession drastically reduces both leisure and business travel demand. Finally, the used car market must remain strong enough to allow Hertz to consistently sell its rental vehicles for high resale prices, which is essential to lock in its long-term profitability targets.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and points of failure in the bull thesis for Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ), leading to the following bear case.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **I. Execution and Leadership Risk**

1.  **High Leadership Instability and Execution Risk:** The assumption of a "flawlessly execute" turnaround is highly speculative, given Hertz has had five CEOs in seven years, with the new CEO, Gil West, only appointed in March 2024. A complex, multi-year "operational transformation" is a major undertaking, and frequent leadership change increases the risk of inconsistent strategy and delayed results.
2.  **Turnaround Timeline is Extended, Not Immediate:** The thesis claims a "return to core profitability in 2025," but the company's own guidance and analyst consensus point to a significant net loss for the full year 2025 (projected loss of over $400 million). The turnaround is expected to be "substantially completed by the end of 2025," implying a delayed and challenging path to true profitability.

#### **II. Financial and Depreciation Challenges**

3.  **Magnitude of Current Losses:** The company's financial hole is deeper than implied, with a GAAP net loss of $2.9 billion for the full year 2024 and an adjusted corporate EBITDA loss for both Q3 and Q4 of 2024. This scale of loss indicates structural issues beyond just the EV experiment, requiring an aggressive and sustained reversal to achieve the $1 billion core earnings target by 2027.
4.  **Depreciation Target is a Steep Climb:** The goal of drastically lowering depreciation relies on reducing Depreciation Per Unit (DPU) to under $300, but the DPU was $537 as recently as Q3 2024. This large gap in a core operating metric introduces significant risk that the company will miss its cost-cutting targets, preventing a return to core profitability.
5.  **Rising Operational Costs and Debt:** Despite the EV sell-off, other costs are increasing, including direct operating expenses due to higher insurance costs and lease expenses. Furthermore, the fleet refresh strategy that is central to the turnaround requires maintaining "high levels of indebtedness," which is a structural financial risk not addressed in the bull case.

#### **III. Market and Competitive Headwinds**

6.  **Uncertainty in the Used Car Market:** The core assumption that the used car market will "remain strong enough" for high resale prices faces a future headwind: more off-lease vehicles are expected to flood the market in late 2025 and 2026, increasing competition for the fleet vehicles Hertz needs to sell at a profit. This could suppress residual values, further straining depreciation costs.
7.  **Service Quality and Competition:** A "back-to-basics" focus is undermined by a key challenge in the car rental industry: high employee turnover (over 80%) and a notable decline in customer satisfaction due to a heavy reliance on self-service digital tools. This risks squandering the "century-old brand" asset and losing market share to rivals who provide better customer service.
8.  **Softer Near-Term Travel Demand:** While the long-term global travel forecast is strong, near-term (2025) growth in the crucial U.S. market is modest, with international inbound travel projected to decline. This modest demand environment will intensify pricing pressure and make it extremely difficult to maximize Revenue Per Unit (RPU) and hit aggressive revenue targets.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ)**

Hertz's ambitious turnaround is an **unproven, highly leveraged gamble** on new leadership flawlessly executing a multi-year operational overhaul against significant macroeconomic and competitive headwinds. The massive financial strain from the EV debacle, evidenced by the $2.9 billion FY 2024 net loss, is a structural hole far deeper than a simple "pivot" can quickly fix. The company faces a triple threat: execution risk from a new, fifth CEO in seven years, continued high depreciation costs that make the path to core profitability in 2025 unlikely, and a high likelihood of residual value pressure from a normalizing used car market in 2026. Coupled with high debt and rising operating expenses (like insurance), the company is more likely to enter a prolonged period of modest, capital-intensive recovery that fails to generate the aggressive $1 billion core earnings by 2027, making the stock a value trap with elevated risk.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the core conflict has shifted from *cost control/survival* to *top-line growth/profitability sustainability*. Your work strongly validates the Long Thesis's **cost-cutting** success (DPU below target, operational improvements) but highlights the **revenue** and **financial structure** as the major remaining headwinds.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further, focusing on the future of Revenue Per Unit (RPU) and Net Income.

### **Key Unanswered Questions and Next Steps**

1.  **Investigate the Sustainability of Depreciation (DPU) Success:**
    *   **Question:** How severe is the projected 230% surge in off-lease **used EV supply** in 2026, and will this create a **wholesale market shock** that negatively impacts the resale value of Hertz's *entire* fleet, not just the small EV portion?
    *   **Action:** Search for analyst models and industry forecasts (Cox, J.D. Power) that quantify the expected drop in average used car prices (residual values) from late 2025 through 2027, explicitly due to the upcoming EV/ICE supply imbalance. This determines if the current low DPU is sustainable.

2.  **Quantify the Revenue Per Unit (RPU) Strategy:**
    *   **Question:** What are the *specific, quantifiable actions* in the "clear commercial strategy" to raise the current RPU of $1,400 to the North Star target of over $1,500, given the current "challenged pricing" environment?
    *   **Action:** Search for details on **dynamic pricing** for value-added services, the revenue impact of the **Amadeus** or other non-Palantir tech partnerships, and any new programs aimed at shifting the customer mix away from low-margin leisure renters towards higher-margin corporate clients.

3.  **Evaluate Corporate Debt and True Profitability (Net Income):**
    *   **Question:** What is the specific impact of the approximately **$6 billion in total corporate debt** and the variable interest rate exposure on the final **Net Income** and the feasibility of the $1 billion Adjusted EBITDA by 2027 goal?
    *   **Action:** Look for recent management commentary on **Total Interest Expense** projections for the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Given the DPU success, the single biggest drag on net income will be interest expense, which is critical for turning positive Adjusted EBITDA into positive EPS/Net Income.

4.  **Validate Customer and Labor Health (Moat Erosion):**
    *   **Question:** Does the reported **11-point Net Promoter Score (NPS) improvement** and lower Direct Operating Expenses (DOE) align with third-party data or commentary on **employee retention** and the *quality* of customer experience?
    *   **Action:** Investigate recent employee reviews (Glassdoor/Indeed sentiment for front-line workers) and specific news/analyst reports on the success or failure of self-service initiatives (like the UVeye damage monitoring) to check the bear case claim of high employee turnover and declining service quality.

5.  **Assess Competitive Response (Avis/Enterprise):**
    *   **Question:** How are key competitors (**Avis Budget Group/CAR** and **Enterprise**) responding to Hertz's successful cost-cutting, and are they engaged in an aggressive **price war** that will permanently cap Hertz's RPU below its target?
    *   **Action:** Search for recent competitor earnings call commentary or analyst notes comparing Hertz's RPU/DPU to Avis/Enterprise's equivalent metrics to understand the current competitive pricing landscape and if Hertz's recovery is coming at the expense of market share or price.
