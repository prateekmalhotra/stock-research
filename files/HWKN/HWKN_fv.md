## 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The business engine is driven by **growth in the Water Treatment segment** (21% growth in Q2 FY2026) through a strategy of **high-margin acquisitions and organic gains**. Management commentary indicates that recent acquisitions have led to increased amortization and interest expense (higher SG&A), which "pinched the bottom line" in the near-term but are expected to **"start boosting the bottom line in fiscal 2027"**.

This commentary forms the basis for the conservative projection:

### A. Revenue Projection (FY2026 - FY2030)

We assume the company's aggressive, acquisition-led growth in Water Treatment will drive above-market revenue growth in the short term, with a deceleration toward a more conservative mid-single-digit growth rate long-term.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue Growth Assumption (YoY) | Justification/Engine Link | Revenue (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Actual)** | N/A | Base Year | \$974.4 |
| **FY2026** | **12.0%** | Conservative estimate, below the Q2 FY2026 TTM growth rate of 14%. Reflects full-year impact of FY2025 acquisitions and partial year of new acquisitions. | \$1,091.3 |
| **FY2027** | **10.0%** | Reflects continued execution of the acquisition-led strategy in the Water Treatment segment, but with a conservative deceleration. | \$1,200.4 |
| **FY2028** | **7.0%** | Further deceleration as the company shifts from acquisition-led to a more normalized organic growth + smaller M&A rate. | \$1,284.4 |
| **FY2029** | **5.0%** | Approaching long-term growth rate. | \$1,348.6 |
| **FY2030** | **4.0%** | Stable long-term growth, reflecting conservative growth in specialty chemicals and water treatment. | \$1,402.5 |

### B. Margin and Net Income Projection

The model uses the TTM Gross Margin of $\approx 23.0\%$ as a base. The Net Income Margin will be initially pressured (FY2026) due to acquisition-related costs (SG&A, amortization, interest) and then improves in FY2027 as the acquisitions start to boost the bottom line, as guided by management.

| Fiscal Year | Gross Margin % | Net Income Margin % | Justification/Engine Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | 23.1% | 8.6% | Based on actuals: \$225.5M Gross Profit / \$974.4M Rev; \$84.0M Net Income / \$974.4M Rev |
| **FY2026** | **23.0%** | **8.2%** | Conservative slight drop from increased SG&A/Amortization due to acquisitions. |
| **FY2027** | **23.5%** | **9.0%** | Management expectation of acquisitions "boosting the bottom line in fiscal 2027" - reflects margin enhancement in the high-margin Water Treatment segment. |
| **FY2028-2030**| **23.5%** | **9.0%** | Stable, normalized margin based on "investing in high-margin business" strategy. |

### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption

The historical Return on Equity (ROE) is approximately $17.5\%$. The rule requires a conservative but reasonable ROIC. Given the company's strong historical performance and focus on high-margin segments, a positive, yet conservative, ROIC is justified for return on *retained* earnings.

*   **Assumed ROIC for Retained Earnings:** **12.0%** (Conservative, below historical ROE)

### D. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.5%** (Reflects the risk associated with a mid-cap company pursuing an acquisition-heavy growth strategy and increased leverage.)
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **2.5%** (A conservative perpetual growth rate, slightly above long-term inflation).

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Cash Flow (NCF) for the DCF is calculated as:
$$
\text{NCF}_{\text{Year } n} = \text{Net Income}_{\text{Year } n} + (\text{ROIC} \times \sum \text{Net Income}_{\text{Years } < n})
$$
The first year's cash is the starting point, and net income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year.

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2026 | FY2027 | FY2028 | FY2029 | FY2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | \$974.4 | \$1,091.3 | \$1,200.4 | \$1,284.4 | \$1,348.6 | \$1,402.5 |
| **Net Income Margin %** | 8.6% | 8.2% | 9.0% | 9.0% | 9.0% | 9.0% |
| **Net Income** (A) | \$84.0 | **\$89.5** | **\$108.0** | **\$115.6** | **\$121.4** | **\$126.2** |
| **Previous Retained Earnings** (B) | N/A | \$84.0 | \$173.5 | \$281.5 | \$397.1 | \$518.5 |
| **ROIC on Retained** (B * 12.0%) (C) | N/A | \$10.1 | \$20.8 | \$33.8 | \$47.7 | \$62.2 |
| **NCF** (A + C) | N/A | **\$99.6** | **\$128.8** | **\$149.4** | **\$169.1** | **\$188.4** |
| **Discount Factor (10.5%)** | 1.000 | 0.905 | 0.819 | 0.741 | 0.671 | 0.607 |
| **NPV of NCF** | N/A | **\$90.1** | **\$105.5** | **\$110.7** | **\$113.4** | **\$114.4** |

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Forecasted Cash Flows (2026 - 2030):**
$$
\text{NPV}_{\text{Forecast}} = \$90.1 + \$105.5 + \$110.7 + \$113.4 + \$114.4 = \mathbf{\$534.1 \text{ million}}
$$

### Terminal Value Calculation (End of 2030)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{NCF}_{\text{FY2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$188.4 \times (1 + 0.025)}{(0.105 - 0.025)} = \frac{\$193.11}{0.080} = \mathbf{\$2,413.9 \text{ million}}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**
The Terminal Value is discounted back to the present (end of 2025/start of 2026).
$$
\text{NPV}_{\text{Terminal}} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{(\text{Discount Factor}_{\text{FY2030}})} = \frac{\$2,413.9}{0.607} = \mathbf{\$1,497.1 \text{ million}}
$$

### Total Fair Value of Equity

$$
\text{Total Fair Value of Equity} = \text{NPV}_{\text{Forecast}} + \text{NPV}_{\text{Terminal}} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}
$$
$$
\text{Total Fair Value of Equity} = \$534.1 \text{M} + \$1,497.1 \text{M} + \$10.42 \text{M} - \$279.0 \text{M} = \mathbf{\$1,762.6 \text{ million}}
$$

## 4. Fair Value Per Share and Conclusion

### Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Diluted Shares Outstanding}}
$$
$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$1,762.6 \text{ million}}{20.85 \text{ million}} = \mathbf{\$84.54 \text{ per share}}
$$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$84.54** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$130.46** |
| **Difference** | **-35.19%** |

### Justification of Difference between Fair Value and Market Price

The calculated Fair Value of **\$84.54** is **35.19% lower** than the current market price of **\$130.46**. This significant difference suggests that the market is making much more aggressive assumptions about Hawkins, Inc.'s future growth and/or profitability than this conservative DCF model.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions (Why the Market is $\sim$50% Higher):**

1.  **Higher Sustained Growth Rate (Acquisition-Heavy Engine):** The market is likely pricing in a longer-term, higher rate of revenue growth, assuming the company will maintain its aggressive M&A strategy for much longer than the 5-year forecast period. While my model uses a conservative deceleration from 12.0% to 4.0%, the market might be expecting a perpetual growth rate in the range of **5.0% - 6.0%** (a 5.5% maturity rate would yield a value much closer to the current market price).
2.  **Quicker and Higher Margin Expansion:** The market is likely more optimistic about the pace and magnitude of the margin expansion. While I project Net Income Margin to improve from 8.2% to a stable 9.0% from FY2027 onward, the market may expect:
    *   Faster relief from acquisition costs in FY2026.
    *   A higher stable Net Income Margin, perhaps **10.0% or greater**, based on the successful integration of high-margin Water Treatment acquisitions.
3.  **Lower Cost of Capital:** A lower perceived risk, resulting in a lower **Discount Rate** (WACC). The market might be using a WACC closer to **9.0%** to account for the stability and critical nature of the specialty chemicals/water treatment business.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

My valuation is a **conservative estimate** designed to meet the prompt's rules, specifically the requirement for conservative assumptions regarding the business engine, ROIC, and discount rates. The lower fair value signals that the stock is highly valued based on the expectation that the Water Treatment segment's rapid, acquisition-fueled growth will translate to sustained, higher net profits than I have conservatively modeled post-2027. Investors are betting heavily on the execution of the M&A strategy and the successful conversion of those new businesses into long-term, high-margin cash flows, justifying the current premium.
