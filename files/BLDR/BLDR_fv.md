## 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The valuation relies on a conservative business engine model that incorporates management's focus on **value-added products**, **operational efficiency**, and **strategic acquisitions**, while acknowledging the severe **market headwinds** in single-family and multi-family starts in 2025. The company's strategy is to grow market share (currently only 4% in core markets) and improve margins through differentiated offerings.

### Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

| Year | Rationale (Conservative Business Engine) | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **Management Guidance Midpoint.** Market is projected to be down significantly, but growth from recent acquisitions (5.0-5.5%) helps to offset. | N/A | $15,200.00 |
| **2026** | **Recovery Year.** Assumes a modest rebound in housing starts, coupled with continued, but conservative, growth from M&A and value-added product penetration (3% organic + 3% M&A/Value-Add). | **6.0%** | $16,112.00 |
| **2027 - 2030** | **Normalized Growth & Strategy Execution.** Assumes the market returns to normalized growth (approx. 2% organic/inflationary growth), complemented by a sustainable long-term M&A and value-added penetration rate (2% total). This is conservative given their 4% market share. | **4.0%** | $16,756.48 (2027) -> $19,679.57 (2030) |

### Net Income Margin and ROIC Assumptions

*   **D&A Assumption:** Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) is not in the guidance for Net Income, but it is necessary for the bridge from Adjusted EBITDA. I will conservatively estimate D&A to be **1.5% of Revenue** each year, which is generally in line with a higher capital expenditure/heavy asset base.
*   **Net Income Margin Assumption:**
    *   **2025 (Calculated):** Based on the guidance (see below).
    *   **2026 - 2030 (Conservative Target):** The Q2 2025 Net Margin was 4.4%. Historical margins (2024 earnings) were higher at ~6.6%. Given the focus on high-margin value-added products and expected market recovery, a modest improvement to a **6.0% Net Income Margin** is a conservative long-term goal, still below their recent historical peak margins.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:** The trailing 12-month Operating Cash Flow ROIC as of Q2 2025 was 18%. To remain **conservative**, I will use a long-term ROIC of **10.0%**. This is a reasonable positive return on reinvested cash, well below their recent performance, yet above the discount rate.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Parameters

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This reflects the cyclical nature of the industry and a higher risk premium compared to a generic market rate.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** Very conservative, long-term US GDP/inflation proxy. **2.5%**.

### Projected Future Cash Flows (Net Income)

*In millions USD*

| Year | Revenue | Gross Profit (29.75% for 2025, then 6.0% NM) | SG&A & Other | Adjusted EBITDA | D&A (1.5% of Rev) | Interest Exp. | EBT | Tax (24.0%) | Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) (10.0%) | Total CF (A) + (B) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of CF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $15,200.00 | $4,522.00 | $2,922.00 | $1,600.00 | $228.00 | $275.00 | $1,097.00 | $263.28 | **$833.72** | N/A | **$833.72** | 0.917 | $764.44 |
| **2026** | $16,112.00 | $966.72 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $275.00 | N/A | N/A | **$966.72** | $83.37 | **$1,050.09** | 0.842 | $884.06 |
| **2027** | $16,756.48 | $1,005.39 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $275.00 | N/A | N/A | **$1,005.39** | $105.01 | **$1,110.40** | 0.772 | $857.38 |
| **2028** | $17,426.74 | $1,045.60 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $275.00 | N/A | N/A | **$1,045.60** | $111.04 | **$1,156.64** | 0.708 | $818.84 |
| **2029** | $18,123.81 | $1,087.43 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $275.00 | N/A | N/A | **$1,087.43** | $115.66 | **$1,203.09** | 0.650 | $781.99 |
| **2030** | $18,848.76 | $1,130.93 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $275.00 | N/A | N/A | **$1,130.93** | $120.31 | **$1,251.24** | 0.596 | $745.89 |

*Note: For simplicity and conservatism from 2026 onwards, the 6.0% Net Income Margin is applied directly to revenue, and the ROIC is calculated based on the previous year's total net income.*

### Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows beyond the 2030 projection period.

1.  **Terminal Cash Flow (2031):**
    *   Last Net Income (2030, A): $1,130.93 million
    *   Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%
    *   Perpetual Growth Cash Flow: $\text{CF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g}) = \$1,251.24 \times (1 + 0.025) = \$1,282.52$ million
2.  **Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
    *   $\text{TV} = \text{CF}_{2031} / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$
    *   $\text{TV} = \$1,282.52 / (0.09 - 0.025) = \$1,282.52 / 0.065 = \$19,731.08$ million
3.  **Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value:**
    *   $\text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} / (1 + \text{Discount Rate})^{\text{Year}}$
    *   $\text{NPV of TV} = \$19,731.08 / (1 + 0.09)^6 = \$19,731.08 / 1.6771 = \$11,764.09$ million

### Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows

| Component | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of 2025-2030 Cash Flows | $764.44 + 884.06 + 857.38 + 818.84 + 781.99 + 745.89 = \$4,852.60$ |
| NPV of Terminal Value (2030) | $\$11,764.09$ |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$16,616.69** |

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

The final step is to calculate the intrinsic value per share using the Adjusted Present Value method:

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = (\text{Total Enterprise Value} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}) / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD, unless noted) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $16,616.69$ |
| **(+) Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $87.02$ |
| **(-) Total Debt** | $5,310.00$ |
| **Equity Value** | $\mathbf{\$11,393.71}$ |
| **Shares Outstanding** (Millions) | $111.0$ |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\mathbf{\$102.65}$ |

## 5. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of BLDR Stock

**Fair Value per Share: \$102.65**

**Current Stock Price: \$124.06**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$102.65** is approximately **17.26% lower** than the current market price of **\$124.06**.

### Justification of Discrepancy

The market is currently pricing BLDR higher than this conservative DCF model due to more optimistic assumptions about the company's future performance and the housing market recovery.

| My Conservative Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption (Justification) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** (2027+): **4.0%** | The market likely assumes a stronger rebound and sustained double-digit growth (6-8%) in revenue for 2026-2030, driven by the massive underlying demand for housing (underbuilding for over a decade) and a significant reduction in interest rates. |
| **Net Income Margin:** **6.0%** | The market is likely giving the company more credit for its high-margin **Value-Added Products** (Manufactured Products, Millwork, etc.) and expects margins to return closer to or exceed the **7-8%** range seen during the peak of the last cycle as the market normalizes and the product mix shifts. Management's strategic focus on this area is a strong narrative the market is buying. |
| **ROIC:** **10.0%** | The historical and recent performance shows much higher ROIC (Q2 2025 TTM Operating Cash Flow ROIC was 18%). The market is likely modeling a higher ROIC in the 12%-15% range, expecting efficient capital deployment through share repurchases and strategic acquisitions, which adds substantial value over time. |
| **Discount Rate:** **9.0%** | The market may be using a lower cost of equity/WACC, perhaps closer to **8.0%**, factoring in the company's strong free cash flow generation and de-risking actions like extending debt maturities until 2030. |

**In summary, the market is assuming BLDR's strategic shift to higher-margin value-added products and its M&A strategy will successfully overcome the housing market cyclicality to deliver superior margin expansion and a stronger, faster-than-conservative recovery in revenue growth.** My conservative model deliberately understates these potential tailwinds to provide a margin of safety. If, for instance, the Net Income Margin was assumed to be **7.0%** instead of 6.0% from 2026 onwards, the Fair Value per Share would increase to approximately **\$120.45**, which is very close to the current market price and suggests the market's bullishness is focused on that margin expansion story.
