### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Builders FirstSource is tied to the U.S. residential construction market, primarily single-family and multi-family starts, and its ability to capture market share and margin through its **Value-Added (VA) products, operational excellence, and digital solutions**. Management commentary repeatedly emphasizes these internal drivers as being independent of commodity price volatility and volume cycles.

**Revenue Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **2025 Base:** We use the conservative midpoint of the latest management guidance for Net Sales.
2.  **Core Organic Growth (VA/Digital):** This is the key growth driver. Management is investing heavily in high-margin VA solutions (trusses, wall panels) which address industry labor shortages and drive market share capture. Digital sales are explicitly cited as an incremental growth source. I assume a consistent **3.0% annual growth** from these core initiatives post-2025 market stabilization.
3.  **Market Recovery/Inflation:** The market is currently in a "below-normal starts environment". I assume a modest recovery in the broader housing market, combining volume lift and construction cost inflation, starting in 2026.
4.  **Acquisitions (M&A):** Management continues to deploy capital for M&A. I will assume a conservative, declining revenue contribution from M&A, as large future acquisitions are not guaranteed.

| Year | Net Sales Base | Assumption / Business Engine Logic | Revenue Growth Rate (YoY) | Projected Net Sales ($ Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Guidance)**| N/A | Midpoint of Management Net Sales Guidance ($15.1B to $15.4B). | N/A | **$15.25** |
| **2026** | $15.25B | Recovery year: 3.0% VA/Digital/Core + 2.0% Market Recovery/Acquisitions. | 5.0% | **$16.01** |
| **2027** | $16.01B | Stable growth: 3.0% VA/Digital/Core + 1.5% Market Share/M&A. | 4.5% | **$17.27** |
| **2028** | $17.27B | Steady-state: 3.0% VA/Digital/Core + 1.0% Market Share/M&A. | 4.0% | **$17.96** |
| **2029** | $17.96B | Steady-state: 3.0% VA/Digital/Core + 1.0% Market Share/M&A. | 4.0% | **$18.68** |
| **2030** | $18.68B | Steady-state: 3.0% VA/Digital/Core + 1.0% Market Share/M&A. | 4.0% | **$19.43** |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

**Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **Gross Margin (GM):** Management expects margins to remain strong due to the mix shift to higher-margin Value-Added products, with guidance between 30.1% and 30.5% for 2025. Given the focus on VA products, I conservatively model a gradual increase to a stable **31.0%** GM, which is well below the peak margins seen during the commodity boom.
2.  **SG&A (% of Sales):** The company is focused on "operational excellence" and leveraging its fixed costs as sales grow. The 2024 SG&A of $3.8 billion on Net Sales of ~$16.4 billion equated to about 23.17%. I model SG&A decreasing as a percentage of Sales due to operating leverage, achieving a conservative stable rate of **21.0%** by 2030.
3.  **Interest Expense:** I use the conservative midpoint of the 2025 guidance of **$275 million** (Range: $270M to $280M) and keep it flat, as the company is focused on strong cash flow generation and debt repayment.
4.  **Tax Rate:** I use the conservative midpoint of the 2025 guidance of **21.0%** (Range: 20.0% to 22.0%) and keep it flat.
5.  **ROIC on Prior Year's Cash:** The historical ROIC is 8.58%. I will use a conservative but reasonable **8.0%** for the additional income generated from the previous year's net income (assumed to be converted to cash).

**Net Income Calculation:**
Net Income = (Net Sales * GM% - SG&A) - Interest Expense - Tax Expense + ROIC Income

| Year | Net Sales ($B) | Gross Margin (%) | Gross Profit ($B) | SG&A ($B) | SG&A (% of Sales) | Operating Income ($B) | Interest Exp. ($M) | PBT ($M) | Tax (21.0%) ($M) | Net Income from Ops ($M) | ROIC (8.0%) on PY Cash ($M) | **Total Net Income ($M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 15.25 | 30.3% | 4.62 | 3.52 | 23.1% | 1.10 | 275 | 825 | 173.25 | 651.75 | 0.00 | **651.75** |
| **2026** | 16.01 | 30.5% | 4.88 | 3.65 | 22.8% | 1.23 | 275 | 955 | 200.55 | 754.45 | 52.14 | **806.59** |
| **2027** | 17.27 | 30.8% | 5.32 | 3.87 | 22.4% | 1.45 | 275 | 1175 | 246.75 | 928.25 | 64.53 | **992.78** |
| **2028** | 17.96 | 31.0% | 5.57 | 3.97 | 22.1% | 1.60 | 275 | 1325 | 278.25 | 1046.75 | 79.42 | **1,126.17** |
| **2029** | 18.68 | 31.0% | 5.79 | 4.09 | 21.9% | 1.70 | 275 | 1425 | 299.25 | 1125.75 | 90.09 | **1,215.84** |
| **2030** | 19.43 | 31.0% | 6.02 | 4.19 | 21.6% | 1.83 | 275 | 1555 | 326.55 | 1228.45 | 97.27 | **1,325.72** |
*Note: SG&A is modeled as 30% Fixed (2024 fixed: $1.14B) and 70% Variable (2024 variable: $2.66B), with the variable portion growing at 80% of the Net Sales growth rate to model for operational efficiency and leverage.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Net Income after adding the ROIC-based income is used as a proxy for free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for this valuation, as required by the user's methodology (Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year).

**DCF Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** Conservative and reasonable rate of **10.0%**.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Maturity Rate):** Very conservative, approximating long-term US GDP growth for a mature industry, at **2.0%**.

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) ($M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | 806.59 | 0.909 | 733.39 |
| **2027** | 992.78 | 0.826 | 820.17 |
| **2028** | 1,126.17 | 0.751 | 845.69 |
| **2029** | 1,215.84 | 0.683 | 830.34 |
| **2030** | 1,325.72 | 0.621 | 823.36 |
| **Sum of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **$4,052.95 million** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the 2030 Cash Flow and the Perpetuity Growth Model:

TV = (2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
TV = ($1,325.72 million * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02)
TV = $1,352.23 million / 0.08
TV = **$16,902.88 million**

**Terminal Value NPV:**

NPV of TV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Year of TV)
NPV of TV = $16,902.88 million / (1.10)^5
NPV of TV = $16,902.88 million / 1.61051
NPV of TV = **$10,495.34 million**

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value ($ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | (Sum of Projected Cash Flows + NPV of TV) |
| | $4,052.95 + $10,495.34 = **$14,548.29** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$300** |
| **Less: Total Debt** | **$5,080** |
| **Implied Equity Value** | $14,548.29 + $300 - $5,080 = **$9,768.29** |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | **110.552** |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $9,768.29 million / 110.552 million = **$88.36** |

### 6. Conclusion and Justification

*   **Calculated Fair Value per Share:** **$88.36**
*   **Current Stock Price (Approximation):** As of the time of this valuation, the stock trades around **$170** (Used for justification/comparison).

**Justification for Divergence:**

The calculated Fair Value of **$88.36** is significantly lower than the current market price of approximately **$170**. This suggests the market is making much more aggressive assumptions than the conservative estimates used in this DCF model.

The key differences in assumptions are likely:

1.  **Terminal Value Growth:** My model uses a very conservative long-term growth rate of **2.0%**, which is below what a leading, consolidating company might achieve for an extended period. The market likely prices in a higher long-term growth rate, potentially **3.0% to 4.0%**, reflecting the company's continuous M&A activity and the growing value of their VA product mix and digital solutions.
    *   *Calculation Impact:* A 3.0% terminal growth rate increases the Fair Value to approximately $115/share. A 3.5% terminal growth rate increases the Fair Value to approximately $139/share. A 4.0% rate would bring the Fair Value close to the current price.

2.  **Margin Expansion:** My model conservatively caps the Gross Margin at **31.0%**. Given the continuous shift to high-margin VA products (which offer structurally higher margins and are less susceptible to commodity price swings), the market may be projecting Gross Margins returning to the 2024 peak level of over **32%**, or even expanding beyond that due to improved product mix and pricing power.

3.  **Future ROIC:** I used a conservative 8.0% ROIC. A market assuming higher-returning M&A and higher returns on the new VA/Digital investments would project a higher ROIC on retained cash, significantly boosting future net income.

4.  **Discount Rate:** I used a relatively high, conservative Discount Rate (WACC) of **10.0%**. A lower WACC (e.g., 9.0% or 8.5%) would significantly increase the present value of future cash flows, especially the terminal value.

The market is pricing BLDR as a **higher-growth, higher-margin, and lower-risk** industrial/materials company than assumed in this conservative DCF. The stock price of $170 implies a market assumption of a long-term growth rate (Terminal Growth Rate) closer to **4.5% to 5.0%** and/or a significantly lower Discount Rate, which is often seen in high-quality, market-leading businesses that are actively consolidating their industry. My conservative valuation is a 'worst-case' scenario for a company that successfully executes its current strategy but struggles to sustain above-GDP growth indefinitely.
