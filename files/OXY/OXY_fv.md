### Part 2: OXY Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

OXY's business engine is driven by three segments: 1) **Oil and Gas (O&G)**, 2) **OxyChem** (Chemicals), and 3) **Midstream and Marketing (M&M)**, with **Low Carbon Ventures (LCV)** as an emerging growth catalyst. The main revenue driver is O&G production volume and realized commodity prices.

#### A. O&G Production and Price Deck (Revenue Engine)

Management's commentary focuses on stable production guidance coupled with capital and operational efficiency gains, strong Permian Basin performance (including CrownRock assets), and international stability (Oman extension). The strategy is to prioritize debt reduction and shareholder returns over aggressive, high-growth production.

**Assumptions:**

1.  **Base Production (2025):** 1.44 million BOE per day (Mboed). This is a conservative midpoint, consistent with Q4 2024's 1.46 Mboed record and Q3 2025 guidance of 1.42-1.46 Mboed.
2.  **Production Growth (2026-2030):** A **conservative 1.0% CAGR** is assumed. This reflects OXY's stated focus on capital discipline and de-leveraging while still capturing incremental growth from Permian efficiencies and new projects like the Oman extension.
3.  **Oil Price (Revenue Driver):** A conservative, long-term oil price deck is used to dampen the impact of commodity volatility, especially considering management noted lower realized prices in H1 2025. WTI prices are a proxy for realized crude prices.

| Year | Production (Mboed) | **O&G Production (Mboed/yr)** | WTI Price (USD/bbl) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | 1.44 | 525,600 | $65.00 |
| **2026** | 1.454 | 530,856 | $64.00 |
| **2027** | 1.468 | 536,165 | $63.00 |
| **2028** | 1.483 | 541,527 | $62.00 |
| **2029** | 1.498 | 546,942 | $61.00 |
| **2030** | 1.513 | 552,412 | $60.00 |

*Note: O&G revenue is simplified as Production (Mboed/yr) x WTI Price to represent the scale of the oil component. This is a very conservative approach to project an oil company's volatile revenue.*

#### B. OxyChem and M&M (Ancillary Revenue/Income)

These segments provide more stable, non-commodity-linked income.

*   **OxyChem Pre-tax Income (2025):** Management guided to a lowered range of $800M - $900M due to margin compression. A conservative **$800 million** is used, with **0% growth** for all future years, assuming cyclical margin compression offsets volume growth.
*   **M&M Pre-tax Income (2025):** Management raised guidance due to optimization and strong Q2 2025 performance. A conservative **$1,000 million** is used for 2025, which is an estimate above the midpoint but conservative given the guidance increases. This is held flat through 2030.
*   **LCV (Low Carbon Ventures):** Management expects **$1 billion in incremental pre-tax FCF from non-O&G sources by 2026**. This includes LCV's STRATOS DAC, which has most volumes contracted through 2030 and is on track to start capturing CO2 in 2025. We will conservatively phase this in: $250M (2026), $500M (2027), and $1,000M (2028-2030) as *incremental* pre-tax income added to the M&M line.

#### C. Consolidated Revenue Projection

| Year | **O&G Revenue (M)** | OxyChem Rev. Proxy (M) | M&M Rev. Proxy (M) | LCV Rev. Proxy (M) | **Total Estimated Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $34,164 | $800 | $1,000 | $0 | **$35,964** |
| **2026** | $33,975 | $800 | $1,000 | $250 | **$36,025** |
| **2027** | $33,778 | $800 | $1,000 | $500 | **$36,078** |
| **2028** | $33,575 | $800 | $1,000 | $1,000 | **$36,375** |
| **2029** | $33,363 | $800 | $1,000 | $1,000 | **$36,163** |
| **2030** | $33,145 | $800 | $1,000 | $1,000 | **$35,945** |

### Part 3: Net Income and Margin Projection

#### A. Margin & Expense Assumptions

1.  **Historical Margin:** OXY's Q1 2025 gross profit margin was around 63.3%. Net income margin is highly volatile due to commodity prices.
2.  **Net Income Margin (Starting Point):** Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders for Q2 2025 was \$288M, or 4.46% of the \$6,460M Revenue. We will use a conservative **10.0%** net margin as a base for 2025 to reflect the expectation of *sustained* operational efficiencies (domestic LOE at \$8.55/BOE) and lower interest expense (repaying $7.5B in debt saving \$410M in annual interest).
3.  **Tax Rate:** A conservative and steady **20%** tax rate is assumed on pre-tax income.
4.  **ROIC (Reinvestment):** The rule requires a conservative but reasonable ROIC. Given the company's focus on high-return, short-cycle assets in the Permian, and a debt reduction focus leading to low capital intensity, a conservative **5.0% ROIC** is applied to the prior year's Net Income (reinvested cash).

#### B. Net Income Projection (2025-2030)

| Year | Total Estimated Revenue (A) | Pre-Tax Margin % (B) | Pre-Tax Income (C = A x B) | Tax (20%) (D) | NI from Operations (E = C - D) | ROIC Income (5.0% on Prior NI) (F) | **Total Net Income (E + F)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $35,964 | 10.0% | $3,596 | $719 | $2,877 | $0 | **$2,877** |
| **2026** | $36,025 | 10.5% | $3,783 | $757 | $3,026 | $144 | **$3,170** |
| **2027** | $36,078 | 11.0% | $3,969 | $794 | $3,175 | $158 | **$3,333** |
| **2028** | $36,375 | 11.5% | $4,183 | $837 | $3,346 | $167 | **$3,513** |
| **2029** | $36,163 | 12.0% | $4,339 | $868 | $3,471 | $176 | **$3,647** |
| **2030** | $35,945 | 12.0% | $4,313 | $863 | $3,450 | $182 | **$3,632** |

*Note: The Net Income Margin (B) is increased slightly each year to conservatively account for the full run-rate benefit of the recurring \$410M annual interest expense savings, the \$350M in 2025 cash impact from efficiency gains, and the ramp-up of the high-margin LCV business.*

### Part 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### A. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative (high) discount rate is used to reflect the inherent volatility and price risk of the Energy sector.
    *   **Assumption: 9.0%**
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** A very conservative, long-term, below-inflation growth rate is assumed for cash flow beyond the projection period.
    *   **Assumption: 2.0%**

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Year 1)** | $2,877 | 0.917 | $2,638 |
| **2026 (Year 2)** | $3,170 | 0.842 | $2,669 |
| **2027 (Year 3)** | $3,333 | 0.772 | $2,575 |
| **2028 (Year 4)** | $3,513 | 0.708 | $2,489 |
| **2029 (Year 5)** | $3,647 | 0.650 | $2,371 |
| **2030 (Year 6)** | $3,632 | 0.596 | $2,165 |
| **Sum of Projected Cash Flows (NPV)** | | | **$14,907** |

#### C. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

1.  **Terminal Value (TV):** (2030 Cash Flow \* (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    *   TV = (\$3,632 \* (1 + 0.02)) / (0.09 - 0.02)
    *   TV = \$3,705 / 0.07 = **$52,929 million**
2.  **NPV of Terminal Value:** TV \* Discount Factor for 2030
    *   NPV of TV = $52,929 \* 0.596 = **$31,547 million**

#### D. Total Enterprise Value (EV)

*   **Total Enterprise Value = NPV of Projected Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value**
*   Total EV = $14,907 + $31,547 = **$46,454 million**

### Part 5: Fair Value Calculation and Justification

#### A. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Enterprise Value (EV) | $46,454 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $2,326 |
| Less: Total Debt | ($23,775) |
| **Equity Value** | **$25,005** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 984.44 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$25.40** |

#### B. Fair Value Conclusion

The calculated Fair Value of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) stock is **$25.40 per share**.

The Current Market Price is approximately **$40.81 per share**.

#### C. Justification for Difference

The calculated Fair Value of **$25.40** is substantially lower than the current market price of **$40.81**, implying that the market's assumptions about the company's future are significantly more optimistic than the conservative assumptions used in this DCF analysis.

**Market's Optimistic Assumptions (Explaining the Higher Market Price):**

1.  **Higher Commodity Prices:** The market is likely pricing in a **higher, sustained, long-term WTI oil price** (e.g., $70-$80/bbl) than the declining price deck of $65 down to $60 used in this analysis. A $10/bbl increase in oil price can drastically raise the valuation for an exploration and production company.
2.  **Higher Production Growth Rate:** The market may be assuming that OXY will accelerate its production growth beyond the conservative 1.0% CAGR used here, capitalizing on the high-quality Permian and CrownRock assets. For instance, a 3-5% annual growth rate would significantly increase the projected terminal cash flow.
3.  **Significant LCV Value (The "WACC" Factor):** The market is assigning a substantial premium to the **Low Carbon Ventures (LCV)** segment, particularly the Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology and its contracted volumes through 2030. LCV is essentially a chemical company selling carbon removal credits, a business with a much higher growth rate and potentially higher future net margins than traditional O&G. The market is likely applying a much **lower WACC (discount rate)** to the cash flows generated by the LCV segment (e.g., 6-7%) and a higher perpetual growth rate to the overall business (e.g., 3-4%) to reflect this transformation, which our model's conservative 9.0% WACC and 2.0% maturity rate did not capture.
4.  **Berkshire Hathaway's Investment:** Warren Buffett's large ownership stake provides a "Buffett premium," signaling market confidence in the long-term value of the company and its LCV transition, which may temporarily keep the stock price elevated relative to a fundamental DCF based purely on current commodity price forecasts.

**Conclusion:** The DCF model, strictly following the rules of conservative oil price assumptions, low growth, and a high discount rate, suggests the stock is overvalued. The market's valuation reflects a strong belief in **higher long-term oil prices, successful execution of the high-growth LCV strategy, and a lower-risk profile** (thus a lower WACC) due to the company's aggressive debt reduction and operational efficiencies.
