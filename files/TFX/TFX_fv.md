### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

#### Business Engine Analysis

Teleflex is a diversified medical device company focused on critical care and surgery. Its portfolio includes vascular access, interventional, surgical, anesthesia, and interventional urology products.

The core driver for the future valuation is the announced plan to divest its **Acute Care, Interventional Urology, and OEM businesses** (referred to as "NewCo") for a total of approximately **\$2.0 billion**, expected to close in the second half of 2026. The remaining company, "RemainCo," will focus on higher-growth, higher-margin assets.

*   **Divestiture Impact (NewCo):** These businesses will be moved to discontinued operations after Q4 2025, and the sale proceeds are expected to be used for debt reduction and share repurchases.
*   **Post-Divestiture Core (RemainCo):** The focus will be on the "high-growth" portfolio, which includes products like **MANTA, EZ-IO, Barrigel, OnControl, PICCS, and hemostatic products**, along with the "durable core" products. The acquired Vascular Intervention business is also a key growth area, anticipated to grow by over 6% from 2026.

#### Revenue Projection Assumptions

The valuation will be performed on the basis of the entire company, with the divestiture cash flows incorporated. However, revenue growth post-divestiture must be based on the smaller, faster-growing "RemainCo" business.

| Year | Revenue Rationale & Calculation | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **Management Guidance:** Use the midpoint of the Q3 2025 adjusted revenue guidance. | **\$3,312.5** |
| **2026** | **Divestiture Impact:** Assume the \$2.0B divestiture is completed mid-year 2026, meaning half of the divested revenue is included for 2026. **Estimate NewCo 2025 Revenue:** Assuming NewCo is $\sim$25% of 2025 revenue for a conservative estimate (based on the sale of three segments for a large amount, and the full year 2024 GAAP revenue of \$3,047.3M). Divested Revenue = \$3,312.5M * 25% = \$828.1M. **Remaining Revenue:** \$3,312.5M - (\$828.1M / 2) = \$2,900.2M. | **\$2,900.2** |
| **2027** | **"RemainCo" Growth:** Post-divestiture, the core "RemainCo" business is expected to be higher growth. I will assume a conservative organic growth rate of **6.0%** for the remaining revenue base of $\sim$\$2,484.4M (i.e., \$3,312.5M - \$828.1M). \$2,484.4M * 1.06 = \$2,633.5M. | **\$2,633.5** |
| **2028** | **Growth Continuation:** Conservative 5.5% growth (mid-single digit growth is the management goal for the core). \$2,633.5M * 1.055 = \$2,778.4M. | **\$2,778.4** |
| **2029** | **Growth Slows:** Conservative 5.0% growth. \$2,778.4M * 1.05 = \$2,917.3M. | **\$2,917.3** |
| **2030** | **Growth Plateaus:** Conservative 4.5% growth. \$2,917.3M * 1.045 = \$3,048.5M. | **\$3,048.5** |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

#### Margin Assumptions

The sale of the Acute Care, Interventional Urology, and OEM segments is expected to improve the overall margin profile as the remaining business focuses on higher-growth, higher-margin products (e.g., MANTA, Barrigel).

*   **Gross Margin (GM):** 2024 GAAP GM was 55.9%. 2025 Adjusted GM guidance is 59.0%. A conservative assumption is that the divestiture will drive a moderate, continued expansion in Gross Margin.
*   **Net Income Margin (NIM):** 2024 GAAP Net Income was \$1.49 EPS * 46.366M shares = \$69.1M (2.27% NIM). The 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance of \$14.10 suggests a much higher underlying profitability. Given the low GAAP NIM in 2024 due to large non-cash adjustments (e.g., goodwill impairment charges of \$512.0M in the first nine months of 2025), the Adjusted EPS provides a better view of operating cash flow. We will assume a conservative, improving Net Income Margin post-divestiture.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Gross Margin % | Gross Profit | Net Income Margin % | Net Income (B) | ROIC % | ROIC Income (C) | Total Cash Flow (B+C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$3,047.3 | 55.9% | \$1,702.7 | 2.3% (GAAP) | **\$69.1** | - | - | - |
| **2025** | \$3,312.5 | 59.0% (Adj. G.) | \$1,954.4 | **12.5%** | **\$414.1** | 6.0% | - | \$414.1 |
| **2026** | \$2,900.2 | 60.0% | \$1,740.1 | **13.5%** | **\$391.5** | 6.0% | \$24.8 | \$416.3 |
| **2027** | \$2,633.5 | 61.0% | \$1,606.4 | **14.5%** | **\$381.9** | 6.0% | \$24.9 | \$406.8 |
| **2028** | \$2,778.4 | 61.5% | \$1,708.0 | **15.0%** | **\$416.8** | 6.0% | \$24.4 | \$441.2 |
| **2029** | \$2,917.3 | 62.0% | \$1,808.7 | **15.5%** | **\$452.2** | 6.0% | \$26.5 | \$478.7 |
| **2030** | \$3,048.5 | 62.5% | \$1,905.3 | **16.0%** | **\$487.8** | 6.0% | \$28.8 | \$516.6 |

*   *Note on 2025 Net Income:* The 2025 Adj. Diluted EPS of \$14.10 * 46.366M shares = \$653.0 million of Adjusted Net Income. To be **conservative**, I use a Net Income Margin of 12.5% of projected revenue (i.e., \$414.1M), which is a significant discount to the adjusted figure, acknowledging potential non-cash addbacks and conservative GAAP assumptions.
*   *Note on ROIC:* I assume a **conservative ROIC of 6.0%** on the previous year's retained cash (Net Income) starting in 2026. This is a low-to-mid single-digit return, representing conservative reinvestment. (ROIC is calculated on the previous year's total cash flow).

---

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### Assumption Justification

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** I use a **10.0%** discount rate. This is a conservative assumption, higher than a typical cost of capital for a stable medical device company, to account for the execution risk related to the divestiture/spin-off.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** I assume a very conservative perpetual growth rate (terminal growth rate) of **2.0%**. This is a low rate for a medical device company and reflects long-term economic inflation and cautious growth for a mature, specialized RemainCo.

#### Calculations

**Terminal Value (TV) at EOY 2030:**

TV = (Year 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
TV = (\$516.6M * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02)
TV = (\$526.9M) / 0.08
**TV = \$6,586.3 million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows (2025-2030):**

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (CF) | Discount Factor (1/(1.10)^t) | Discounted Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$414.1 | 0.909 | \$376.8 |
| **2026** | \$416.3 | 0.826 | \$344.0 |
| **2027** | \$406.8 | 0.751 | \$305.5 |
| **2028** | \$441.2 | 0.683 | \$301.3 |
| **2029** | \$478.7 | 0.621 | \$297.3 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | \$516.6 | 0.564 | \$291.3 |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | \$6,586.3 | 0.564 | \$3,714.6 |
| **Sum of Discounted CF & TV** | | | **\$5,630.8 million** |

**Total Enterprise Value (EV) from DCF:** **\$5,630.8 million**

---

### V. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value** = EV + Cash from Divestiture - Net Debt

1.  **Enterprise Value (EV from DCF):** \$5,630.8 million
2.  **Cash from Divestiture (NewCo Sale):** The company expects to receive approximately **\$1.8 billion** in after-tax proceeds in 2026. I will discount this back to the present.
    *   *Discounted Cash from Divestiture:* \$1,800M * (1 / (1.10)^1.5) $\approx$ \$1,564.0 million (Assuming mid-2026 close, discounted for 1.5 years).
3.  **Net Debt:** \$2,290.2 million
    *   *Note:* The company expects to use the proceeds for "stock repurchases and debt reduction". Since the debt is subtracted from the total value, and the cash is added, the cash from the sale effectively nets out the debt reduction plan.

**Total Equity Value** = \$5,630.8M + \$1,564.0M - \$2,290.2M
**Total Equity Value** = **\$4,904.6 million**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

Fair Value Per Share = \$4,904.6 million / 46.366 million shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$105.78**

---

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is \$105.78**.
The **Current Market Value Per Share is \$105.36** (as of February 4, 2026).

The calculated fair value is almost perfectly aligned with the current market price (a difference of only 0.4%).

#### Justification for Fair Value and Market Alignment

The market's current valuation of **\$105.36** is rational and reflects the assumptions used in this conservative DCF model:

1.  **Consensus on Restructuring:** The market is fully pricing in the anticipated value of the successful restructuring and divestiture. The valuation inherently acknowledges the sale of "NewCo" (Acute Care, Interventional Urology, and OEM businesses) for approximately **\$2.0 billion**, which provides a significant cash injection to pay down debt and/or repurchase shares, thereby increasing equity value.
2.  **Conservative Growth and Margin Expansion:** The model assumes that the core "RemainCo" will be a mid-single-digit grower (5.0%-6.0% after the divestiture), which is a reasonable and relatively conservative outlook for a medical device portfolio, aligning with management's commentary on the future high-growth areas. The projected Net Income Margin expansion (from 12.5% to 16.0%) reflects the expected improved profitability post-divestiture of lower-margin assets.
3.  **Conservative Discount Rate:** The use of a **10.0%** discount rate is conservative, suggesting the market's required rate of return is also high, factoring in the inherent risk of executing a complex spin-off/sale transaction and integrating a major acquisition (Vascular Intervention).

The close alignment between the calculated fair value and the market price suggests that the market has adopted a similar, rational, and conservatively grounded view of the company's prospects, particularly the successful execution of its divestiture and the subsequent growth profile of the remaining business.

**Final Valuation:**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **\$105.78** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$105.36** |
| **Valuation Conclusion** | The stock is fairly valued. |
