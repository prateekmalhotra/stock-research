### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

Teleflex is a diversified medical device company. Its business engine is driven by its focus on two main strategies: the high-growth **Interventional** and **Vascular Access** product categories, and managing its core/durable businesses. A significant upcoming event is the planned separation of the company into two independent publicly traded companies (RemainCo and NewCo), which is expected to position the "RemainCo" with a stable portfolio and the "NewCo" (likely Interventional Urology/UroLift and potentially others) with a pure-play, high-growth focus.

Management's guidance for 2025 is very conservative, suggesting a period of transition or caution, especially following a **2025 adjusted constant currency revenue growth guidance of only 1% to 2%** and an announced acquisition of BIOTRONIK Vascular Intervention business in Q1 2025.

**Revenue Engine Assumptions:**

*   **2025:** I will use the high end of the constant currency revenue guidance of **2.0%** to account for the impact of acquisitions like BIOTRONIK Vascular Intervention business (announced Feb 2025) and Palette Life Sciences. I will assume foreign exchange headwinds will net to zero over the long run, but apply a 1.8% headwind in 2025 as guided by management in the Q4 2024 call.
    *   *Base Growth:* 2.0% (Management Guidance)
    *   *FX Headwind:* -1.8%
    *   *Net Revenue Growth:* **0.2%**
*   **2026 - 2030:** Following the slow 2025, I project an accelerated growth driven by the strategic focus on high-growth segments like Interventional and Vascular Access (which saw 14.8% and 7.3% adjusted constant currency growth in 2024, respectively), geographic expansion (Asia is a key driver), and the potential re-acceleration of the Interventional Urology business with new product launches (e.g., Eurlift3) and the clearing of the Italian payback measure. The proposed company separation is also expected to unlock value and focus on growth for both resulting entities.
    *   I will assume a conservative constant currency growth of **5.0%** for 2026, building on the underlying strength, and then linearly declining to a sustainable, conservative long-term growth rate of **4.0%** by 2030.

| Year | 2024 Revenue (Est., M) | Constant Currency Growth | FX Impact | Net Revenue Growth | Projected Revenue (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,143.14 | N/A | N/A | N/A | **$3,143.14** |
| **2025** | $3,143.14 | 2.0% | -1.8% | 0.2% | **$3,149.42** |
| **2026** | $3,149.42 | 5.0% | 0.0% | 5.0% | **$3,306.89** |
| **2027** | $3,306.89 | 4.75% | 0.0% | 4.75% | **$3,464.39** |
| **2028** | $3,464.39 | 4.5% | 0.0% | 4.5% | **$3,620.28** |
| **2029** | $3,620.28 | 4.25% | 0.0% | 4.25% | **$3,773.91** |
| **2030** | $3,773.91 | 4.0% | 0.0% | 4.0% | **$3,924.87** |

### **III. Margin and Net Income Projections**

**Margin Assumptions:**

*   **Gross Margin (GM):** Management guided 2025 adjusted GM to 60.25% to 61%. I will use the high end, **61.0%**, as the base, reflecting the benefits from the termination of the MSA, acquisitions, and cost improvement initiatives. I will assume a slight expansion to **61.5%** by 2030 as the company continues its portfolio optimization and integration of higher-margin businesses.
*   **Operating Margin (OM):** Management guided 2025 adjusted OM to 26.6% to 27.0%. I will use the midpoint, **26.8%**, for 2025. I will project an increase to **27.5%** by 2030, driven by operating leverage on higher revenue and continued efficiency gains (restructuring impact).
*   **Net Interest Expense:** Q3 2024 net interest expense was $18.8M. Management expects $78M for full year 2024. This is a good approximation for future years, assuming stable debt levels and interest rates. I'll use a conservative figure of **$75.0M** per year.
*   **Tax Rate:** The Q3 2024 adjusted tax rate was 13.6%. To be conservative and account for the impact of global tax reforms, I will use a **15.0%** effective tax rate.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Based on the past performance and the steady profitability of the medical device industry, I will assume a conservative but reasonable ROIC of **8.0%**.

**Net Income Calculation ($ in millions):**

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (A)** | $3,149.42 | $3,306.89 | $3,464.39 | $3,620.28 | $3,773.91 | $3,924.87 |
| **Gross Margin %** | 61.0% | 61.1% | 61.2% | 61.3% | 61.4% | 61.5% |
| **Operating Margin %** | 26.8% | 27.0% | 27.1% | 27.2% | 27.3% | 27.5% |
| **Operating Income** | **$844.04** | **$892.86** | **$939.81** | **$984.71** | **$1,030.07** | **$1,079.34** |
| Less: Net Interest Exp. | $75.00 | $75.00 | $75.00 | $75.00 | $75.00 | $75.00 |
| **Pre-Tax Income (B)** | $769.04 | $817.86 | $864.81 | $909.71 | $955.07 | $1,004.34 |
| Less: Tax Expense (15.0%) | $115.36 | $122.68 | $129.72 | $136.46 | $143.26 | $150.65 |
| **Net Income (C)** | **$653.68** | **$695.18** | **$735.09** | **$773.25** | **$811.81** | **$853.69** |
| **+ ROIC on Prev. NI (D)** | $0.00 | $52.30 | $55.61 | $58.81 | $61.86 | $65.26 |
| **Cash Flow to Equity (C + D)** | **$653.68** | **$747.48** | **$790.70** | **$832.06** | **$873.67** | **$918.95** |

*   *ROIC on Prev. NI (D)* is calculated as (Net Income from prior year) * 8.0%. This implements the rule: "net income for next year = net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year." Since the valuation starts in 2025, no prior year's Net Income is assumed to have generated ROIC in 2025.

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

**DCF Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** Given the relatively stable, essential nature of the medical device industry, but also the moderate leverage and the planned corporate separation, a conservative but reasonable WACC is appropriate. I will use **8.0%**.
*   **Terminal/Maturity Growth Rate:** A very conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting a mature company growing slightly faster than inflation due to its presence in growing healthcare markets. I will use a **3.0%** perpetual growth rate.

| Year | Cash Flow to Equity (M USD) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $653.68 | 0.9259 | $605.10 |
| **2026** | $747.48 | 0.8573 | $640.83 |
| **2027** | $790.70 | 0.7938 | $627.46 |
| **2028** | $832.06 | 0.7350 | $611.51 |
| **2029** | $873.67 | 0.6806 | $594.57 |
| **2030** | $918.95 | 0.6302 | $579.13 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | $31,507.03 | 0.6302 | $19,856.88 |
| **Total Equity Value** | N/A | N/A | **$23,815.48** |

*   *Terminal Value Calculation (2030):* [2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
    *   TV = [$918.95M * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.08 - 0.03) = $946.52M / 0.05 = **$18,930.40 million.**
    *   *Correction to TV calculation based on Net Income being used as FCFE:* The Terminal Value should capture the ongoing value. A slightly more conservative approach often used for the final cash flow is: [2030 Net Income * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate).
    *   *Revised TV Calculation:* [$853.69M * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.08 - 0.03) = $879.30M / 0.05 = $17,586.00 million.

    *   *Final Cash Flow to Equity (2030)* is $918.95M. Using the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) perpetuity formula:
    *   TV = [FCFE(2030) * (1 + g)] / (r - g) = [$918.95M * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.08 - 0.03) = **$18,930.40 million.**

*   *Total Equity Value:* Sum of all NPVs ($605.10 + $640.83 + $627.46 + $611.51 + $594.57 + $579.13 + $18,930.40) = **$22,589.00 million.**

### **V. Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (NPV)** | $22,589.00 |
| Less: Total Debt | $1,758.421 |
| Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents | $317.478 |
| **Fair Market Value of Firm** | **$21,148.057** |
| Shares Outstanding (in millions) | 46.366 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$456.12** |

### **VI. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: $456.12**

The current market price of Teleflex Incorporated (TFX) stock is not provided, but for the sake of comparison, assuming a historical price range, the fair value is likely significantly higher than the current market price (which often sits around \$200 - \$240).

**Justification for Discrepancy (Market Value vs. Fair Value):**

The calculated fair value of **$456.12** is significantly higher than the typical market value of TFX stock. The main reasons for this discrepancy are rooted in the model's assumptions versus the market's perception:

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative Nature of the DCF):** An **8.0%** discount rate is likely low for a publicly traded, mid-cap company, particularly one undergoing a significant restructuring and facing international risks (e.g., the Italian payback measure) and currency headwinds. The market typically incorporates a higher cost of equity, which would drastically lower the Net Present Value.
2.  **ROIC Assumption:** The model assumes an **8.0% ROIC** on retained Net Income, which aggressively compounds the projected cash flow and significantly boosts the final NPV, especially in the Terminal Value. The market is unlikely to price in such a high rate of return on retained earnings, preferring a more conservative assumption of all Net Income being distributed or reinvested at a lower or non-existent incremental return.
3.  **Terminal Growth Rate and Value:** The **3.0%** perpetual growth rate is high for a mature medical device company. Any decline in this rate to a truly conservative 1.0% or 2.0% would substantially reduce the Terminal Value, which accounts for over 80% of the total calculated value.
4.  **2025 Transition and Uncertainty:** The company's very low **0.2%** net revenue growth guidance for 2025 and the forthcoming **separation into two publicly traded companies** introduce significant market uncertainty. The market tends to heavily discount future cash flows when a major, complex corporate action is pending, as this introduces execution risk and the potential for a non-optimal division of assets.
5.  **Softness in UroLift:** The management commentary on "softness in the UroLift business" (a key growth driver) suggests that the high-growth segment's performance is currently below expectations, which would temper the market's long-term growth expectations for the whole company, especially for the "NewCo" (Interventional Urology business).

**My Conservative/Reasonable Case:**

The model is built on the most optimistic interpretations of management guidance for margins (high-end of ranges, expanding thereafter) and a very favorable assumption for the compounding effect of an $8.0\%$ ROIC. While the revenue growth is modest after 2025 (4-5%), this is the core of the disagreement. The market is signaling that it does not believe TFX can sustain a $\text{Net Income / FCFE}$ growth that warrants a $3.0\%$ perpetual growth rate and an $8.0\%$ discount rate, especially given the transition risks and the current headwinds in UroLift. The market is valuing TFX based on:

*   **Higher Discount Rate (e.g., 9.5% - 10.0%)** due to M&A/restructuring risk.
*   **Lower Terminal Growth Rate (e.g., 2.0% - 2.5%)** due to recent underperformance in key growth drivers.
*   **Lower ROIC** assumption for reinvestment.

The valuation suggests that **if** Teleflex executes its restructuring plan perfectly, overcomes the current UroLift softness, and achieves the implied margin expansion and ROIC, the stock is deeply undervalued. However, the market is currently pricing TFX as a company facing more uncertainty and having lower future growth/return prospects than my model assumes.
