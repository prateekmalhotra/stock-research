### II. The Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

#### A. Business Engine Analysis

DENTSPLY SIRONA's core business revolves around providing dental professionals with a comprehensive portfolio of products, including Consumables, Equipment & Instruments, and Digital Solutions.

**Core Drivers of Future Revenue ("Business Engine"):**
1.  **Digital Adoption:** The company is focusing on its "DS Core" digital platform, which is showing growing engagement (50,000 unique users) [cite: 7 in step 2, 5 in step 2]. This platform connects its hardware (CAD/CAM, Imaging) and software solutions, driving demand for both high-margin consumables and equipment upgrades.
2.  **Strategic Focus Areas:** Management is prioritizing growth in **SureSmile** (clear aligners) and **Wellspect Healthcare** (urology/bowel care) [cite: 9 in step 2, 17 in step 2].
3.  **Operational Transformation:** The ERP modernization, supply chain transformation, and SKU optimization initiatives are primarily aimed at *margin expansion* and operational efficiency, which supports the top-line by freeing up resources for innovation [cite: 4 in step 2, 5 in step 2].

**Significant Headwinds and Conservatism:**
1.  **Immediate-Term Weakness:** The 2025 outlook is a net sales decline of 4.0% to 2.0% in constant currency, including a 2% negative impact from the **Byte** clear aligner business [cite: 2, 4 in step 2, 6 in step 2]. This indicates that underlying growth in the core business is barely offsetting the Byte decline and external macro-pressures, particularly in the U.S. CTS and OIS segments [cite: 1 in step 2, 5 in step 2].
2.  **Impairment and Tariffs:** The significant goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and an increase in the annualized tariff impact to \$80 million signal persistent competitive and macro pressures in key segments (OIS and CTS) [cite: 5 in step 2, 6 in step 2].
3.  **Long-Term Target Revision:** The previously stated target of **4-6% normalized organic growth starting in 2025** is clearly contradicted by the 2025 guidance (midpoint decline of 3.0% on constant currency, or 1.0% excluding Byte) [cite: 2, 4 in step 2, 10 in step 2]. This necessitates a conservative delay and reduction of the long-term growth rate.

#### B. Revenue Projections

| Year | Rationale/Assumption | Revenue (Millions USD) | Year-over-Year Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Baseline)** | FY 2024 Net Sales [cite: 14 in step 2] | \$3,793 | (4.3%) |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | Midpoint of FY 2025 Net Sales outlook (\$3.60B - \$3.70B) [cite: 2, 4 in step 2, 6 in step 2] | **\$3,650** | **(3.8%)** |
| **2026** | Assume a flat year as management focuses on the "Enhance & Sustain Profitability" and "ERP modernization" initiatives to stabilize the core business and fully cycle out the Byte and other restructuring impacts. (Conservative) | **\$3,650** | **0.0%** |
| **2027** | Start of conservative organic growth. Assume the new CEO's focus on "long term sustained profitable growth" [cite: 1 in step 2] and investments in innovation begin to take hold. Growth is projected at the low end of the *long-term dental market* growth expectation. | **\$3,760** | **3.0%** |
| **2028** | Gradual improvement as digital (DS Core) and strategic focus areas (SureSmile, Wellspect) accelerate, but stay below the historical management target of 4-6% due to macro/competitive pressures. | **\$3,873** | **3.0%** |
| **2029** | Stable, conservative growth in-line with a diversified dental leader operating in a mature, but growing, market. | **\$3,990** | **3.0%** |
| **2030** | Stable, conservative growth. | **\$4,110** | **3.0%** |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

#### A. Margin Analysis & Assumptions

| Metric | Rationale/Assumption | Projected % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adjusted Gross Margin** | Q2 2025 Adjusted Gross Margin was 55.9%. The margin expansion is a key pillar of management's strategy, driven by supply chain/cost reduction programs [cite: 5 in step 2]. The projection conservatively holds this recent *adjusted* margin constant. | **55.9%** |
| **Net Income Margin (2025 Baseline)** | Based on the 2025 Outlook midpoint: Adjusted EPS of \$1.90 and 204.5M shares outstanding implies Adjusted Net Income of \$388.55M. Revenue midpoint is \$3,650M. Baseline Net Income Margin (Adjusted) = \$388.55M / \$3,650M = 10.64%. The GAAP figures show a net loss, so I will use a conservative **Net Income Margin of 7.5%** for the GAAP-based cash flow model to account for non-recurring/non-cash charges like amortization and impairments that management adjusts out. | **7.5%** |
| **Net Income Margin (2026 - 2030)** | Management is aiming for sustainable profitability and has an "Adjusted EBITDA margin exceeding 19%" target for 2025 [cite: 4 in step 2]. We project a slow, conservative improvement in Net Income Margin as the restructuring and cost-control initiatives pay off, ERP is completed in 2026 [cite: 6 in step 2], and the company realizes operating leverage on a growing top-line. | **+0.5% per year** (up to a cap) |
| **ROIC on Accumulated Cash** | Past performance has been negative due to impairments [cite: 14 in step 2, 1 in step 1], but future projections are positive. A conservative, reasonable positive ROIC for a stable, large-cap medical device company is assumed. | **5.0%** |

#### B. Net Income Forecast & Cash Flow Accumulation

The model assumes: Net Income for the year is added to the cash pile from the previous year. ROIC is then calculated on this new cash pile to generate "Additional Income" for the next year.

| Metric (Millions USD) | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Revenue** | \$3,650 | \$3,650 | \$3,760 | \$3,873 | \$3,990 | \$4,110 |
| **B. Net Income Margin** | 7.5% | 8.0% | 8.5% | 9.0% | 9.5% | 10.0% |
| **C. Net Income** (A x B) | \$273.8 | \$292.0 | \$319.6 | \$348.6 | \$379.0 | \$411.0 |
| **D. Prior Year's Accumulated Cash** | \$0.0 | \$273.8 | \$583.5 | \$931.0 | \$1,332.0 | \$1,786.6 |
| **E. ROIC on Cash** (5.0%) | N/A | \$13.7 | \$29.2 | \$46.6 | \$66.6 | \$89.3 |
| **F. Total Cash Flow (C + E)** | **\$273.8** | **\$305.7** | **\$348.8** | **\$395.2** | **\$445.6** | **\$500.3** |
| **G. Accumulated Cash/Net Income (D + C)** | \$273.8 | \$583.5 | \$931.0 | \$1,332.0 | \$1,786.6 | \$2,296.9 |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

#### A. Discount Rate & Terminal Growth Rate

| Metric | Rate | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate** (g) | **2.0%** | This is a conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above global inflation, representing the maturity of the diversified dental equipment market and reflecting the company's historical performance. |
| **Conservative Discount Rate** (r) | **9.0%** | This represents a reasonable cost of equity for a publicly traded industrial healthcare company that is currently in a turnaround phase and facing headwinds, but has strong long-term market positions. It is a conservative value above the long-term historical S&P 500 return average. |

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Total Cash Flow (Millions) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + r)^n) | Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (n=1) | \$273.8 | 0.9174 | \$251.2 |
| **2026** (n=2) | \$305.7 | 0.8417 | \$257.3 |
| **2027** (n=3) | \$348.8 | 0.7722 | \$269.4 |
| **2028** (n=4) | \$395.2 | 0.7084 | \$280.0 |
| **2029** (n=5) | \$445.6 | 0.6499 | \$289.6 |
| **2030** (n=6) | \$500.3 | 0.5963 | \$298.3 |
| **Sum of NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030):** | | | **\$1,645.8** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value (TV) is calculated as the Perpetuity with Growth in 2030.
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{Cash Flow_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g}$$
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\$500.3 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$510.3}{0.07} = \$7,290.0 \text{ Million}$$

#### D. Terminal Value Present Value

$$PV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$7,290.0 \text{ Million} \times 0.5963 = \text{\$4,345.5 Million}$$

#### E. Total Enterprise Value (TEV)

$$\text{TEV} = \text{Sum of NPV of Cash Flows} + \text{PV of Terminal Value}$$
$$\text{TEV} = \$1,645.8 \text{ Million} + \$4,345.5 \text{ Million} = \text{\$5,991.3 Million}$$

---

### V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The Fair Value is calculated using the following formula:
$$\text{Fair Value} = \frac{\text{TEV} + \text{Total Cash \& Cash Equivalents} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | \$5,991.3 |
| **+ Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$359.0 |
| **- Total Debt** | (\$2,402.0) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$3,948.3** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 204.5 (Millions) |
| **FAIR VALUE PER SHARE** | **\$19.31** |

### Fair Value of XRAY Stock: **\$19.31**

The fair value of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. stock, based on this conservative DCF analysis, is **\$19.31 per share**.

#### Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated Fair Value of **\$19.31** is significantly *higher* than the recent market price of approximately **\$13.68** (as of August 6, 2025, pre-earnings) [cite: 5 in step 2].

**The Market's Assumptions vs. My Assumptions:**

| Factor | My Conservative DCF Assumption | Market Implied Assumption (Lower Value) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Turnaround Success** | Turnaround is successful, resulting in a slow, but positive, **3.0%** organic growth rate (below historical target of 4-6%) by 2027. Net Income Margin improves from 7.5% to 10.0% by 2030. | The current challenges (Byte, tariffs, U.S. weakness, leadership changes) are more persistent, leading to a long-term organic growth rate closer to **1-2%**, or sustained margin pressure. |
| **Cost of Capital/Risk** | A relatively high **9.0%** discount rate is used, reflecting moderate risk. | The market is likely discounting future cash flows at a *significantly higher* rate (e.g., 10-11%+), reflecting major uncertainty surrounding the new CEO's ability to execute a successful turnaround, the severity of the U.S. market slump, and the risk of future goodwill impairments/write-offs. |
| **Terminal Value** | Assumes a long-term growth rate of **2.0%**. | The market is likely pricing in a **Terminal Growth Rate of 0-1%** due to the headwinds, or using a much higher discount rate, which severely lowers the terminal value component. |

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The primary reason for the higher calculated fair value is the assumption of a successful, albeit conservative, turnaround that restores a decent level of profitability and growth by 2027. The market is expressing a deep skepticism about DENTSPLY SIRONA's ability to execute on its "Enhance & Sustain Profitability" and "Win in High Growth Categories" strategic pillars [cite: 7 in step 2]. The market is demanding a higher risk premium (higher discount rate) and is likely projecting lower top-line growth and margin expansion than the $19.31 valuation implies, pricing the stock for a scenario where the turnaround either fails or delivers minimal results. The valuation of **\$19.31** represents a baseline **Intrinsic Value** assuming a successful, conservative execution of the current strategic plan.
