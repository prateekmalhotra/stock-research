## 1. Baseline Financial Data (As of October 3, 2025)

The following data is sourced from Enovis Corporation's most recent SEC filings (Q3 2025 10-Q and associated press releases).

| Metric | Value | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $33.617 | Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of Oct 3, 2025 |
| **Total Debt** | $1,360.000 | Total debt as of Q3 2025 |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 57.19 million | As of October 31, 2025 |
| **Full Year 2025 Revenue Guidance (Midpoint)** | $2,255.000 | Midpoint of $2.24B - $2.27B range |
| **Full Year 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance (Midpoint)** | $3.175 | Midpoint of $3.10 - $3.25 range |

**Notes on Initial Data:**
*   The "cash" value represents cash and cash equivalents, which are liquid and immediately available.
*   The GAAP net income is not used as a starting point due to a significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $548 million in Q3 2025, which caused a large GAAP net loss. The valuation is therefore built on the company's *adjusted* performance metrics and guidance, which management has consistently provided to reflect underlying operating trends.

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

The business engine is driven by two segments: Reconstructive (Recon) and Prevention & Recovery (P&R). Management commentary consistently highlights Recon as the high-growth driver due to new product introductions and acquisitions (like Lima), while P&R provides stability.

**Engine Assumptions:**

| Metric | 2025 Baseline/Guidance | 2026 Assumption | 2027 Assumption | 2028 Assumption | 2029 Assumption | 2030 Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue (2025E)** | $2,255.000 | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Organic Growth (Total)** | 6.5% (Midpoint) | 6.0% | 5.0% | 4.0% | 3.0% | 2.5% |
| **Rationale for Growth Taper** | Start near guidance, conservatively tapering due to: 1) Medical technology is an ex-growth market, 2) Competition, and 3) Lima integration benefits normalizing. This is a very conservative growth trajectory for a "high-growth medtech company." |

**Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030):**

| Year | Revenue Calculation | Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | *Midpoint of Guidance* | **$2,255.000** |
| **2026** | $2,255.000 x (1 + 6.0%) | **$2,390.300** |
| **2027** | $2,390.300 x (1 + 5.0%) | **$2,509.815** |
| **2028** | $2,509.815 x (1 + 4.0%) | **$2,610.208** |
| **2029** | $2,610.208 x (1 + 3.0%) | **$2,688.514** |
| **2030** | $2,688.514 x (1 + 2.5%) | **$2,755.727** |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

**Margin Assumptions:**

Management commentary indicates consistent adjusted gross margin expansion (up 90 bps in Q2 2025) and improved Adjusted EBITDA margins due to favorable product mix and operational excellence (EGX initiatives). To be conservative, we will use a **Net Income Margin** that is lower than the implied current adjusted net margin and only allow for very modest expansion.

1.  **2025 Baseline Net Income:**
    *   Adjusted EPS Midpoint: $3.175
    *   Shares Outstanding: 57.19 million
    *   2025 Adjusted Net Income (Base) = $3.175 x 57.19 = **$181.564**
    *   2025 Net Income Margin (Base) = $181.564 / $2,255.000 = **8.05%**

2.  **Future Net Income Margin:** We will use a conservative expansion of the net income margin, reflecting the efficiency gains mentioned by management, but only by a very small amount.

| Year | Net Income Margin Assumption | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 8.05% | Derived from 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance |
| **2026** | 8.35% | Modest 30 bps expansion due to scale and cost controls |
| **2027** | 8.65% | Modest 30 bps expansion |
| **2028** | 8.95% | Modest 30 bps expansion |
| **2029** | 9.25% | Modest 30 bps expansion |
| **2030** | 9.50% | Modest 25 bps expansion (tapering improvement) |

## 4. Cash Flow and DCF Calculation

**ROIC Assumption:**

The company's GAAP Net Income is negative due to non-cash items, making historical ROIC non-representative of the operating business. A common long-term conservative ROIC for a stable business is 5% to 8%. Given ENOV is an "innovation-driven, medical technology growth company", we will use a **conservative 5.0% ROIC** on retained earnings, which is a low estimate for a growing medtech business.

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Parameters:**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.0%** (This is below the long-term US GDP average, reflecting a conservative, long-term, inflation-adjusted growth rate).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** **9.0%** (A standard conservative rate for a medical technology company with a healthy debt load).

**Projected Net Income / Cash Flow:**

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Net Income from Operations (C) = A x B | Accumulated Net Income from Prior Year (D) | ROIC Income (E) = D x 5.0% | **Total Cash Flow (F) = C + E** | Discount Factor @ 9.0% | **NPV of Cash Flow** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2,255.000 | 8.05% | **$181.564** | $0.000 | $0.000 | **$181.564** | 0.917 | **$166.495** |
| **2026** | $2,390.300 | 8.35% | $199.590 | $181.564 | $9.078 | **$208.668** | 0.842 | **$175.698** |
| **2027** | $2,509.815 | 8.65% | $217.109 | $390.232 | $19.512 | **$236.621** | 0.772 | **$182.723** |
| **2028** | $2,610.208 | 8.95% | $233.513 | $626.853 | $31.343 | **$264.856** | 0.708 | **$187.575** |
| **2029** | $2,688.514 | 9.25% | $248.683 | $891.709 | $44.585 | **$293.268** | 0.650 | **$190.624** |
| **2030** | $2,755.727 | 9.50% | $261.794 | $1,184.977 | $59.249 | **$321.043** | 0.596 | **$191.248** |
| **Terminal Value** | - | - | - | $1,506.020 | - | **$349.567** | 0.596 | **$208.615** |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flow** | | | | | | | | **$1,302.978** |

**Calculation of Terminal Value (TV):**
*   TV in 2030 = (2030 Cash Flow) x (1 + Maturity Rate) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV in 2030 = $321.043 x (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02)
*   TV in 2030 = $327.464 / 0.07 = **$4,678.057**
*   NPV of TV = $4,678.057 x 0.596 (2030 Discount Factor) = **$2,790.281**

**Sum of NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** $1,302.978
**NPV of Terminal Value:** $2,790.281

**Total Equity Value (NPV of All Future Cash Flows):** $1,302.978 + $2,790.281 = **$4,093.259**

| **Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $33.617 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $1,360.000 |
| **Calculated Fair Value of Equity** | **$2,766.876** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 57.19 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $2,766.876 / 57.19 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$48.38** |

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **$48.38** |
| **Current Market Price (Hypothetical)** | *Assume: $55.00* |

**Justification for Fair Value Difference:**

In this hypothetical example where the market price is $55.00 and the calculated fair value is **$48.38**, the stock appears **overvalued** by the market relative to this conservative DCF model.

**Why the Market Assumptions May Differ:**

The market is likely incorporating a significantly **higher growth trajectory and/or a higher profitability margin** based on the success of the Reconstructive segment and the impact of the Lima acquisition.

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** The market may assume a maturity rate of **3.0% - 3.5%** (closer to long-term nominal GDP/inflation for medical device spending) instead of the conservative 2.0%. A 3.0% terminal growth rate would drastically increase the NPV.
2.  **Faster Margin Expansion:** The market may project a faster and higher Net Income Margin. If the company continues to execute on its "EGX" operational excellence initiatives and the higher-margin Recon business outgrows P&R, the net margin could reach **11-12%** by 2030.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** Given the stability and recession-resistant nature of medical technology, the market may perceive a **lower WACC (e.g., 8.0%)** for ENOV, reflecting a lower-risk profile.

**Conclusion on Conservatism:**

The difference of $6.62 per share ($55.00 vs $48.38) is likely due to the highly conservative assumptions used in this model: a rapidly tapering growth rate, a very modest margin expansion, and a low ROIC and terminal growth rate. The DCF suggests that for the market price to be justified, investors must be expecting one or more of the following: a long-term revenue growth rate above $2.5\%$, a net income margin consistently above $9.5\%$, or a lower cost of capital, all of which are plausible given management's focus on organic growth and operational improvement in a stable medtech market. The **$48.38 Fair Value** represents a justifiable conservative baseline for the stock.
