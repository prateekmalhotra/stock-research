## Business Summary

FB Bancorp, Inc. operates as a traditional community bank focused mainly on serving a specific regional area. Its core business model involves gathering money from local customers through savings and checking accounts (deposits). The bank then lends this money out, primarily to small and medium-sized businesses for commercial loans and commercial real estate development within its local market. The bank makes most of its income from the difference between the interest it collects on the loans it issues and the smaller amount of interest it pays to its depositors. While the bank also earns fee income by providing services like wealth management and treasury solutions, the majority of its revenue is derived directly from this lending activity.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk is Credit Risk, meaning the business clients and commercial property developers to whom the bank lends money may be unable to repay their obligations, causing immediate capital losses. This specific threat is amplified now by potential instability in commercial real estate markets, which has historically caused major regional banking failures, such as during the 2008 financial crisis. A second significant near-term risk is interest rate volatility: if the bank must rapidly increase the interest rates it pays to keep depositors from moving their money to higher-yielding competitors, its core profit margin (the difference between interest earned and interest paid) will quickly erode. Long term, the bank faces intense competitive pressure from large national institutions and technology firms (fintech) that offer superior digital platforms and lower-cost services, potentially making it harder for the regional bank to attract new customers and maintain its market position over time.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA), the holding company for the over 115-year-old Fidelity Bank, presented in simple, jargon-free terms.

### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose (1908 - Early Days)**

1.  **The True Beginning:** The company’s roots trace back to **December 28, 1908**, when it was founded in Louisiana as the Fidelity Homestead Association.
2.  **Original Goal:** It was created as a "mutual institution" (a type of organization owned by its members/depositors, not stockholders), with the core purpose of promoting **thrift and home ownership** in the community.
3.  **Core Service:** Its mission was to give local people a safe place to save money and provide the necessary funds for buying or building a home, fulfilling a vital need for the working class in the early 20th century.
4.  **Long-Term Dedication:** This local focus solidified its reputation, leading to the bank's current mission: to be the long-term "institution of choice" in its marketplace, centered on empowering individuals, businesses, and communities across Louisiana.

### **II. Major Headwinds and Innovative Solutions**

5.  **Headwind: Regional Disaster (Hurricane Katrina):** A massive challenge came in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina, which caused unprecedented economic damage and chaos in its primary market of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.
6.  **Innovative Solution: Rapid Adaptation:** The extreme conditions and breakdown of traditional infrastructure forced the bank to adapt quickly, serving as a "catalyzing event" for adopting new technology to keep communication and service lines open, such as utilizing text messaging to connect with customers and employees.
7.  **Headwind: Digital Age Efficiency:** More recently, the bank struggled with modern business problems, specifically managing a huge volume of customer data manually, which slowed down operations and made marketing campaigns inefficient.
8.  **Innovative Solution: Digital Automation:** The bank invested in a major digital overhaul, partnering with technology firms to automate their customer communication processes, which led to a **40% reduction** in the time it took to execute marketing campaigns and improved data accuracy.

### **III. The Transition to FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA)**

9.  **The Pivot to Public Ownership:** After over a century as a mutual bank, the institution completed a major conversion in **October 2024**, transitioning into a stock-owned corporation.
10. **Founding FB Bancorp (FBLA):** FB Bancorp, Inc. was created as the new holding company, and its shares began trading publicly on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker FBLA.
11. **The Modern Goal:** The purpose of this "mutual-to-stock conversion" was to **expand the company's capital** by raising nearly $200 million from selling shares, which in turn is intended to fuel long-term growth and enable the bank to offer more advanced financial services.

### **IV. Current Tailwinds and Headwinds (Post-2024)**

12. **Major Tailwind: Abundant Capital:** Following the public offering, the company is considered "overcapitalized," meaning it has a large amount of equity (money) relative to its assets.
13. **Capital Strategy:** This significant capital cushion, or "substantial liquidity," is a major tailwind that can be used to drive shareholder value through strategies like buying back its own stock and starting a quarterly dividend, which attracts investors.
14. **Headwind: Profitability and Asset Quality:** A major current challenge has been a struggle with **profitability** in the immediate post-IPO period, with the company reporting recent net losses due to factors like increased interest expenses and reduced non-interest income.
15. **Headwind: Regional Economic Risk:** Because the company’s business is concentrated in the Louisiana market, it remains highly exposed to local economic conditions and future regional disasters, which is a constant, unavoidable risk for any local bank.
16. **Overall Goal Today:** FB Bancorp's goal is to successfully execute a proven plan for newly public banks: use the large amount of capital to conservatively grow its loan portfolio, steadily return money to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and ultimately, prove that its over 115-year commitment to the local community can translate into long-term financial stability and growth in the public market.

## Moat Analysis

FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA), through its subsidiary Fidelity Bank, relies on a "soft moat" typical of a community bank, which it is now attempting to strengthen with specific digital and community-focused initiatives.

### The Moat and Differentiation of FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA)

1.  **Community-Based Soft Moat (History and Trust):**
    *   Fidelity Bank was founded in 1908, giving it a century-plus history that creates deep local brand recognition and a reputation of trust within the Southern Louisiana community.
    *   This long-standing presence acts as a "soft moat" because customers, particularly older ones and local businesses, often prefer banking with an institution they perceive as an established, permanent, and reliable community fixture.

2.  **Local Market Specialization and Focus:**
    *   The bank's entire focus is concentrated in the Southern Louisiana economy, particularly in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Lafayette.
    *   This deep local knowledge allows for relationship-based lending, especially in commercial real estate and commercial loans, which is harder for national banks to replicate from afar.

3.  **Differentiation via Unique Community Programs:**
    *   The bank fosters strong community ties through programs like the **Community Partner program**, which provides financial services and annual gifts to over 130 local non-profit organizations.
    *   Another unique feature is the **School Debit Card**, which donates a portion of every signature purchase to the cardholder's chosen school, turning everyday transactions into a form of local giving and creating customer loyalty.

4.  **Special Position in the Market (Digital Expansion to the Underserved):**
    *   Fidelity Bank is seeking a special position by launching a separate digital-only brand called **ANDI** ("A New Day In Banking").
    *   This is an attempt to expand the bank's reach beyond its physical branches to access unbanked and underserved communities across all of Louisiana, where the unbanked rate is higher than the national average.

### Pricing Power and Displacement Risk

1.  **Pricing Power and Products:**
    *   FB Bancorp, as a community bank, does not have significant, proprietary pricing power; its core products (deposits and loans) are highly commoditized and offered by countless competitors.
    *   Its pricing advantage comes from its ability to service highly specific local or commercial lending needs that larger competitors may overlook or be too rigid to handle.

2.  **Risk of Displacement by More Capital:**
    *   The bank is highly susceptible to displacement by larger banks with significantly more capital.
    *   A large national or regional bank could easily offer better deposit rates, lower loan interest rates, or more advanced technology, which would quickly erode the smaller bank's market share, especially since its profitability and asset quality have been noted as weaker than its peers.
    *   The greatest value catalyst for the stock has been noted as its position as an overcapitalized mutual conversion, which can drive share repurchases, not a unique operational advantage.

### Stickiness, Network Effects, and Innovation

1.  **Customer and Contract Stickiness:**
    *   **High Stickiness:** Traditional banking is inherently sticky due to high switching costs; it is a major hassle for a person or business to move checking accounts, direct deposits, mortgages, or complex commercial loans.
    *   **Recurring Contracts:** The business is built on recurring relationships—deposits are recurring, and loan payments and interest are recurring for the life of the contract.

2.  **Solid Moat Creation and Innovation (The Digital Strategy):**
    *   The company is actively trying to create a solid moat by investing in digital capabilities, specifically the **ANDI** digital bank.
    *   ANDI is powered by a modern, cloud-based core system, suggesting the bank is trying to be digitally efficient and scalable, which is its form of innovation to compete with fintechs and larger institutions.
    *   However, this represents an investment in keeping up with the competition, not a unique technological edge that competitors cannot replicate.

3.  **Network Effects:**
    *   **No Strong Network Effect:** FB Bancorp does not possess a true network effect like a social media platform or a two-sided marketplace, where the value of the service increases exponentially with each new user.
    *   The closest it gets is a localized community effect, where its deep ties to local non-profits and schools may lead to a positive feedback loop of community involvement driving new customer acquisition through trust and referral.

## Catalyst Analysis

FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA) is the holding company for Fidelity Bank, which completed its conversion from a mutual bank to a stock-owned corporation (IPO) in October 2024. The catalysts for a potential increase in the stock price are primarily driven by the post-conversion strategy and the bank’s current valuation.

## Near-Term Catalysts (0-18 months)

1.  **Initiation of Share Repurchase Program:** The stock is trading at a significant discount to its tangible book value (TBV), and the company is overcapitalized after its conversion. This low valuation makes share buybacks highly appealing, as every share repurchased immediately increases book value for the remaining shareholders.
2.  **Introduction of a Quarterly Dividend:** As a second step to narrow the gap between the stock price and TBV, the company is widely expected to issue a modest, quarterly dividend, which would attract income-focused investors.
3.  **Profitability Improvement:** Continued sequential improvement in net interest income, net interest margin, and overall net profits—as seen in the first half of fiscal year 2025—can reduce concerns over past profitability and asset quality issues.
4.  **Loan and Deposit Growth:** The bank’s strategy includes focusing on expanding its loan portfolio, particularly commercial real estate and commercial loans, and successfully attracting new deposits to support this growth.

## Management's Strategy and Catalysts

*   **Management's Post-Conversion Strategy:** The conversion to a stock-owned corporation was described by management as a "significant milestone" in its commitment to fostering long-term growth and expanding capital.
*   **Operational and Market Strategy:** The management team's strategic focus is on enhancing the loan portfolio, strengthening digital banking capabilities, and expanding the bank's physical presence in key Louisiana markets like Baton Rouge and Lafayette.
*   **Capital Allocation (Implied):** While specific timing for buybacks and dividends may not be explicitly released, the bank's overcapitalized state and low valuation (trading at approximately 65% of tangible book value in early 2025) strongly suggest that shareholder-friendly capital actions like repurchases and dividends are the next logical steps to drive value, which is common for banks after this type of conversion.

## Long-Term Catalysts (3+ Years)

1.  **Merger or Acquisition (M&A):** A primary long-term catalyst for demutualized banks is their eventual sale to a larger strategic buyer. Federal regulations typically require a three-year waiting period after the conversion before the bank can be sold.
2.  **Full Realization of Tangible Book Value:** Historically, banks that are acquired often trade at a significant premium to their tangible book value (TBV), meaning the price could rise simply as the market anticipates the full valuation of the bank's assets.

## Management Record

An analysis of FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA) management, led by CEO Chris S. Ferris, provides the following key points for an investor.

### I. CEO & Management Performance and History

1.  **CEO Tenure and Background:** Christopher S. Ferris has served as President and CEO of Fidelity Bank and its NOLA Lending Group division since January 2018, representing stable leadership over a significant period. He joined Fidelity Bank in 2014, previously holding various leadership roles at the larger regional bank BB&T (now Truist), bringing experience from a major financial institution to the community bank.
2.  **Succession and Internal Change:** Ferris's appointment in 2018 was the result of a "robust and long-term succession planning process" by the Board of Directors, indicating a planned, internal transition rather than a crisis.
3.  **Track Record (Internal View):** Management credits Ferris with playing a significant role in transforming sales and operations since 2014, focusing on "efficient, user-friendly banking products and services" that have allowed the bank to experience "record growth."
4.  **Popularity and Local Recognition:** The CEO is well-regarded in the local community, having been a three-time recipient of the New Orleans City Business “Money Maker” award and being inducted into its "Money Maker Hall of Fame."
5.  **Management Stability and Compensation:** The executive management team has a relatively high average tenure of 5.7 years, suggesting operational stability. However, CEO Ferris's direct ownership is low at 0.19\% of the company's shares.

### II. Key Decisions and Shareholder Value Delivery

1.  **Major Strategic Decision (IPO/Conversion):** CEO Ferris successfully led the conversion from a mutual savings bank to a stock-owned corporation (FB Bancorp, Inc.) with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in October 2024, raising substantial capital. This conversion was intended to support the business strategy, enhance capital flexibility, and position the institution for long-term growth.
2.  **Financial Trade-Offs:** Management has driven loan and asset growth, particularly in commercial real estate and commercial loans. However, this growth has been accompanied by a noted decline in credit quality, with non-performing assets significantly higher than industry averages for banks of similar size.
3.  **Profitability Challenges:** The company reported a net loss for the 2024 fiscal year, which was largely attributed to a \$5.8 million goodwill impairment and a decrease in gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights. This impairment indicates a past issue with a capital allocation decision, such as an acquisition whose value did not materialize.
4.  **Shareholder Value Metrics:** Due to the recent IPO, performance history for public shareholders is limited, but recent profitability metrics like Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are cited as being far below industry and peer standards by analysts. The stock trades at a discount to book value (Price/Book of approximately 0.75), which may suggest market skepticism regarding the bank's profitability and asset quality.

### III. Future Strategy and Vision

1.  **Growth and Diversification:** The core strategy is to leverage the capital raised from the IPO to accelerate growth by diversifying the loan portfolio and expanding into new markets, specifically Baton Rouge and Lafayette.
2.  **Digital and Community Focus:** The company's mission is "HERE FOR GOOD," focusing on simple, easy, and fast banking services, with a stated strategy to enhance digital banking capabilities.
3.  **Acquisition Ambition (Long-Term):** The proceeds from the stock offering may also be used to pursue acquisitions of other banks or branch offices in the future, although federal regulations prohibit new acquisitions for three years following the conversion.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available ownership and compensation data for FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA), the current incentive structure indicates a potential misalignment with long-term shareholder interests due to very low insider ownership and a compensation mix that appears to reward executives even when the company is unprofitable.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Very Low Insider Ownership:** The total ownership by all insiders, including managers and directors, is exceptionally low at **2.21%** of the company's stock. This low percentage suggests that the financial interests of the management and board are not strongly tied to the long-term appreciation of the stock price for the majority of the business.
2.  **CEO's Minimal Stake:** The President and CEO, Chris Ferris, directly owns only **0.19%** of the company's shares. While this stake is valued at over \$400K, the fractional percentage is not a significant personal holding compared to the overall company value, which diminishes the "owner-operator" incentive.
3.  **Low Barrier to IPO/Recent Conversion:** FB Bancorp only completed its Initial Public Offering in October 2024, following a mutual-to-stock conversion. In this context, the management and board's overall average tenure is relatively short (1.7 years for the board), and the current low ownership level for a newly public company does not yet demonstrate a strong commitment to accumulating significant long-term equity.

### **Compensation Structure**

4.  **High Fixed Compensation for CEO:** The CEO's annual compensation structure is comprised of a relatively high **57% salary** and 43% performance-based bonuses/equity. A high fixed salary component reduces the "at-risk" portion of compensation, meaning a significant part of their pay is guaranteed regardless of company performance or shareholder returns.
5.  **Compensation Despite Unprofitability:** The CEO's compensation has reportedly **increased** despite the company being unprofitable. This is a critical sign of poor alignment, as executive pay is rising while shareholder equity is not being created, suggesting performance metrics may be too easily achieved or are tied to non-shareholder value metrics.
6.  **Other Executive Compensation:** Other key executives receive substantial annual salaries (e.g., CFO at \$478K, Executive Chairman at \$409K). Without clear public disclosures of the performance metrics tied to their variable compensation (such as specific EPS or Return on Assets targets), there is a risk that this compensation is also insufficiently tied to creating shareholder value.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

7.  **Incentive to Line Own Pockets:** The combination of a very low insider ownership (2.21%) and a compensation structure that rewards executives with increased pay even while the company is unprofitable suggests that management's current financial incentives are tilted **towards lining their own pockets** with fixed and non-performance-based compensation.
8.  **Insufficient Shareholder Alignment:** Management has **insufficient incentive** to act primarily in the long-term interest of the shareholders, as their pay is predominantly protected from poor stock performance and company unprofitability. A significant increase in their overall stock ownership and a shift in their variable compensation to be contingent on clear, measurable, and aggressive shareholder return metrics would be necessary to correct this misalignment.

## Price History

Based on technical analysis and recent price history for FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA), here is an analysis of the stock.

***

1.  **Current Price Position:** As of recent data, the stock is trading near its 52-week high, having climbed significantly from its low. The 52-week high is \$12.74, and the 52-week low is \$9.81.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** With a representative price of approximately \$12.30, FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA) is trading roughly **25.38%** above its 52-week low of \$9.81.

3.  **Technical Analysis Rating:** Based on a technical analysis, the stock is currently not considered to be "trading low," as some models are indicating a **'Buy'** or **'Strong Buy'** signal. This suggests that the stock's recent upward momentum is seen as a positive technical indicator.

4.  **Recent Price Gains:** The stock has shown positive short-term momentum, rising by over 5% in the last month and over 2.5% in the preceding two weeks (as of late September 2025). This recent rally suggests the stock has seen a good upward trend in the last few months, moving away from its April 2025 low.

5.  **Historical Price Drop Context:** The stock hit its 52-week all-time low of \$9.81 in April 2025, following a high of \$12.74 in December 2024, indicating a notable drop in the first part of the year.

6.  **Explanation for Drops/Gains (Fundamentals):** While net interest income increased due to a growing balance sheet and expanding net interest margin, the company faced a big hit from a drop in the gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights (from \$2.3 million to zero in one quarter). This likely contributed to price volatility and may explain the price stagnation or drops observed earlier in the year.

7.  **Profitability and Valuation:** The company's profitability metrics, such as Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), have been cited as being far below industry standards, which has led some analysts to maintain a bearish long-term view despite the stock trading at a discount to book value. However, net profits have recently shown an improvement.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case relies on the bank's massive cash pile and its eventual sale. After recently raising nearly $200 million by going public, the bank has far more money than it needs. Near term, management will use this excess cash to aggressively reward shareholders by buying back its own stock (which is currently trading cheaply) and starting a regular dividend. This immediately increases the value for remaining shareholders. Meanwhile, the bank will invest the rest of the capital to safely expand its local loan portfolio and grow its digital offerings (like the ANDI brand) to attract new customers efficiently. The ultimate payoff, which usually happens in the long term for banks that follow this strategy, is that the bank becomes an attractive and well-capitalized takeover target for a larger regional bank three to five years down the line, unlocking a significant premium for investors.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario assumes several crucial things happen: 1. Management must actually execute the plan by initiating large share buybacks and a dividend soon. 2. The bank must fix its recent struggles with profitability and start generating consistent net income. 3. The new loans the bank issues must be high quality, meaning its business and commercial real estate clients must be able to repay them, preventing a crisis in credit quality. 4. Management, despite its low personal stock ownership, must prioritize efficient growth and shareholder returns over self-serving compensation.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for FB Bancorp, Inc. (FBLA) has significant and demonstrable flaws when checked against the company's current financial realities and corporate structure.

### Critique and Flaws in the Bull Case Thesis

1.  **Immediate Shareholder Rewards are Not Evident:** The bull case's core premise of an "immediate" payoff via aggressive buybacks and a dividend is contradicted by current facts, as FBLA has not initiated a dividend and there is no public information confirming a large share buyback program.
2.  **Profitability is Severely Lacking and Worsening:** The assumption that the bank will "start generating consistent net income" contradicts the company's recent performance, which included a \$6.2 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. Key profitability metrics like Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are critically low, suggesting fundamental operational problems persist.
3.  **Credit Quality is Deteriorating:** The thesis assumes new loans will be "high quality" to prevent a credit crisis, but non-performing loans have risen significantly from \$7.7 million to \$13.0 million, signaling a worsening trend in the existing loan portfolio. This rising credit risk is concerning, especially with the portfolio's concentration in commercial real estate and commercial loans.
4.  **Management Alignment is Questionable:** The bull case's caveat about management's low ownership is a critical flaw: the CEO's direct ownership is very low (0.19%), and his compensation has been increasing even as the company remained unprofitable, which suggests a potential misalignment of incentives with common shareholders.
5.  **Digital Strategy (ANDI) is Unproven and High-Risk:** While the digital brand (ANDI) aims for efficient customer acquisition in underserved, high-unbanked markets, the initiative is very new (launched March 2024) and highly speculative, meaning its ability to "efficiently expand" is an unproven bet, not a solid foundation for growth.
6.  **Takeover Premium is Less Likely:** A massive capital base, combined with poor profitability and rising credit risk, makes the bank an expensive *fix* for an acquirer. The buyer would have to pay a premium to acquire the capital, then absorb the cost and risk of solving the bank’s operating and credit problems, diminishing the chance of a "significant premium" for investors.

***

### Bear Case Thesis

1.  **Cash-Drain Risk Outweighs Capital-Heavy Safety:** The large cash pile from the IPO is a temporary benefit that will be rapidly depleted if the bank's structural profitability problems are not fixed, forcing a capital deployment strategy (e.g., share repurchases) that destroys value rather than creates it.
2.  **Credit Quality Deterioration in a Concentrated Market:** The rising trend in non-performing loans, concentrated in the vulnerable commercial real estate and commercial segments of a localized market (Southern Louisiana), creates a high risk of future writedowns and further increases in the provision for credit losses.
3.  **Protracted Operational Turnaround:** The bank's consistently weak profitability metrics indicate that a turnaround will be a multi-year effort that may not succeed; until it achieves a sustainable return on assets, the stock deserves to trade at a substantial discount to its book value.
4.  **Misaligned Management Incentives Delay Capital Return:** Due to the CEO's minimal stock ownership and the lack of an immediate dividend or buyback announcement, management may prioritize slow, internally-focused growth and compensation structures over aggressive capital returns, delaying the shareholder payout indefinitely.
5.  **Takeover Thesis Fails on Quality:** The persistent operational issues and credit quality concerns will deter potential acquirers, as they would be forced to pay a premium for a bank that still requires significant and costly remediation, undermining the long-term M&A payoff.

---

## Next Steps

The initial analysis is robust, highlighting the critical tension between the bull case (massive capital/M&A potential) and the bear case (poor profitability/worsening credit quality/misaligned management).

The most important next step is to close the information gaps regarding the company's immediate actions (shareholder returns) and the specific internal performance hurdles for management.

Here are the most important questions still left unanswered and the necessary next steps for investigation:

### **I. Critical Unconfirmed Catalysts & Capital Allocation**

1.  **Has FB Bancorp (FBLA) initiated a Share Repurchase Program or declared a Dividend?**
    *   The entire short-term bull thesis relies on the company using its "overcapitalized" status for aggressive shareholder returns. The analysis confirms no public information has been found. This must be the first priority to verify, as a "no" greatly damages the short-term case.

2.  **What is the confirmed, final date for the M&A lock-up expiration?**
    *   The analysis states the bank can be sold three years after the October 2024 IPO. It is necessary to confirm the exact date (i.e., October 2027) based on regulatory filings, as this is the hard long-term catalyst date for the stock.

### **II. Management Incentives and Alignment**

3.  **What are the specific, measurable performance metrics tied to the CEO's variable compensation?**
    *   The analysis confirms a critical misalignment: the CEO's pay increased despite unprofitability, and 43% is variable. The next step is to find the specific hurdles (e.g., *must achieve X% Return on Assets* or *Y dollar-amount of Net Income*) from the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A) section of the Proxy Statement. This will clarify if management is rewarded for simple growth or for shareholder value.

### **III. Validation of Growth Strategy**

4.  **Is the new digital banking brand (ANDI) showing measurable success?**
    *   The new **ANDI** digital bank is a key part of the growth strategy to expand efficiently. Research must be done to find any public data, press releases, or news articles on its performance, such as the total number of new customers, the dollar amount of deposits acquired, or its cost-per-acquisition. This will determine if the long-term growth story is viable or merely speculative.

### **IV. Deeper Dive into Credit Quality**

5.  **What is the current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on the commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio?**
    *   The analysis confirms rising Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and concentration in the high-risk CRE sector. To properly assess the *depth* of the credit risk, the average Loan-to-Value (LTV) for their CRE loans is needed. A low LTV provides a capital cushion; a high LTV makes any property market instability an existential threat. This data is typically found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of recent Quarterly Reports (10-Q).
