## TKO Group Holdings, Inc. (TKO) Stock Valuation

This valuation uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on financial data from TKO Group Holdings, Inc.'s SEC filings and management guidance from earnings call transcripts. The model projects Net Income as a proxy for unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCF) for simplicity, with an adjustment for cash generated from existing assets (ROIC), and is designed to be conservative in its assumptions as required.

### II. Business Engine and Revenue/Margin Projection Justification

The core of TKO's business engine consists of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), both of which generate significant revenue through long-term, high-margin media rights contracts.

*   **Key Revenue Drivers (The Business Engine):**
    1.  **Media Rights Escalators:** Management highlights that key multi-year media rights deals for UFC and WWE provide a "multi-year high-margin contractual revenue stream with annual escalators". This provides high revenue visibility and stability.
    2.  **Live Event & Expansion:** WWE's revenue growth is driven by the expansion of Premium Live Events (PLEs) (e.g., SummerSlam) and increasing site fees. UFC continues to see strong underlying trends despite event timing fluctuations. Both brands are focused on global expansion into new, lucrative markets.
    3.  **Margin Expansion:** The high-margin media rights revenue is expected to drive "meaningful margin expansion". The core segments, UFC and WWE, exhibit high Adjusted EBITDA margins (51-52%).

*   **Conservative Projection Assumptions:**
    *   **Revenue Growth (2026-2030):** I will project a **6.0%** Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from the midpoint of 2025 guidance. This is a conservative assumption, as it's slightly above the typical contractual media rights escalator (often 4-5%) but is justified by:
        *   The combined company's increased negotiating power.
        *   The organic growth from ticket sales and sponsorship for an expanded live event calendar.
        *   The global expansion of both brands.
    *   **Net Income Margin (2025-2030):** I will be highly conservative with the Net Income Margin to account for high Non-Controlling Interest, Debt Interest, D&A, and Taxes, as TKO is a recent merger.
        *   **2025 Margin:** Projecting a conservative **10.0%** Net Income Margin (NI/Revenue) for 2025.
        *   **Margin Expansion:** Due to management's guidance on "meaningful margin expansion" from the long-term, high-margin contractual revenue, I will conservatively allow the Net Income Margin to increase by **0.5%** per year, topping out at **12.5%** by 2030.
    *   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** I will use a conservative **5.0%** for the additional income generated from the prior year's retained cash (Net Income) to project the incremental income for the following year. This is close to the reported past ROIC of 4.73% and is reasonable for a stable, intellectual property-heavy business.

### III. Projected Income Statement and Cash Flow (in millions)

| Year | Revenue Projection | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income | + ROIC Income (5.0%) | Total Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | \$4,705.00 | 10.0% | \$470.50 | \$0.00 | \$470.50 |
| **2026** | \$4,987.30 (+6.0%) | 10.5% | \$523.67 | \$23.53 | **\$547.20** |
| **2027** | \$5,286.54 (+6.0%) | 11.0% | \$581.52 | \$26.18 | **\$607.70** |
| **2028** | \$5,603.73 (+6.0%) | 11.5% | \$644.43 | \$29.08 | **\$673.51** |
| **2029** | \$5,940.00 (+6.0%) | 12.0% | \$712.80 | \$32.22 | **\$745.02** |
| **2030** | \$6,296.40 (+6.0%) | 12.5% | \$787.05 | \$35.65 | **\$822.70** |

*   *Note: Projected Net Income for the next year assumes Net Income from the current year goes straight to cash, and that cash is used to generate additional income at a conservative ROIC of 5.0%. Total Cash Flow = Projected Net Income + ROIC Income.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Discount Rate Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **8.5%**
    *   *Justification: A conservative rate reflecting the company's moderate debt level, combined with the low-risk, high-visibility cash flows from media rights deals.*
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%**
    *   *Justification: A very conservative rate for a mature entertainment business to capture long-term GDP and inflation-aligned growth.*

| Year | Total Cash Flow (millions) | Discount Factor (8.5%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$547.20 | 0.9217 | \$504.48 |
| **2027** | \$607.70 | 0.8495 | \$516.24 |
| **2028** | \$673.51 | 0.7829 | \$527.18 |
| **2029** | \$745.02 | 0.7216 | \$537.47 |
| **2030** | \$822.70 | 0.6650 | \$547.11 |
| **Sum of Projected NPVs (2026-2030)** | | | **\$2,632.48** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**

Terminal Value (TV) = [2030 Cash Flow * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
TV = [\$822.70M * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.085 - 0.02)
TV = \$839.15M / 0.065
TV = **\$12,909.99 million**

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

NPV(TV) = TV / (1 + WACC) ^ 5
NPV(TV) = \$12,909.99M / (1.085 ^ 5)
NPV(TV) = \$12,909.99M / 1.5037
NPV(TV) = **\$8,585.83 million**

**Total Enterprise Value (TEV):**

TEV = Sum of Projected NPVs + NPV of Terminal Value
TEV = \$2,632.48M + \$8,585.83M
TEV = **\$11,218.31 million**

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | \$11,218.31 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$861.40 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$3,759.00 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$8,320.71** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**

Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Total Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$8,320.71 million / 197.91 million shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$42.04**

---

### VI. Conclusion and Justification of Difference

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is \$42.04**.

**Comparison with Market Value:**
Assuming the current market price is approximately **\$100.00**, the calculated fair value is significantly lower than the market price.

**Justification for the Difference:**

The difference of over 138% indicates that the market is currently making much more aggressive assumptions about TKO's future growth and profitability than the conservative model outlined above.

1.  **Market Assumptions (What the Market is Pricing In):**
    *   **Higher Long-Term Growth (g):** The market is likely pricing in a perpetual growth rate significantly higher than the 2.0% used here, possibly 3.5% to 4.5%, reflecting the global growth potential of the UFC and WWE brands, which are still expanding into new markets and platforms.
    *   **Accelerated Margin Expansion:** The market is factoring in a much faster and more significant conversion of the high Adjusted EBITDA (33.5% in 2025) into Net Income, possibly projecting a Net Income Margin exceeding 18-20% within the next five years, which would reflect a successful realization of "meaningful margin expansion".
    *   **Massive Media Rights Uplift:** The market is likely predicting a substantial multiple increase on the next round of media rights renewals (post-2028), assuming a double-digit percentage increase due to the scarcity of premium, year-round live content.
    *   **Lower Discount Rate:** Given the contracted nature of a large portion of TKO's revenue, the market might be using a lower WACC (e.g., 7.0% or less), viewing the cash flows as lower risk.

2.  **Conservative Model (Why the Model is Different):**
    *   **Conservative Growth Rate:** The 6.0% revenue growth for a period where major new media rights deals are already factored in is purposefully conservative.
    *   **Aggressive Margin Discount:** The Net Income Margin expansion is slow (10.0% to 12.5%). TKO has substantial non-controlling interest, interest expense from debt, and significant D&A, which will depress the GAAP Net Income compared to Adjusted EBITDA. The market often focuses on the higher Adjusted EBITDA figure for media/entertainment companies, while this DCF is strictly tied to Net Income as a conservative, owner-earnings proxy.
    *   **High Discount Rate:** The 8.5% WACC and the low 2.0% perpetual growth rate intentionally create a very conservative Terminal Value, prioritizing the near-term contracted cash flows over speculative long-term growth.

**Conclusion:** The market is assigning a significant premium to TKO based on the expectation of continuous, successful, and *accelerated* negotiation of media rights uplifts and a much higher conversion of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income due to operating synergies not fully accounted for in this conservative valuation. The gap between the Fair Value (\$42.04) and the Market Price (\$100.00) represents the market's bullishness on the scarcity value of TKO's content and its growth potential from global expansion and operational synergies derived from the merger.
