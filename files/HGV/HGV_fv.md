### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

HGV's business engine is driven primarily by: 1) **Contract Sales** of Vacation Ownership Intervals (VOIs), and 2) **Recurring Revenue** from Resort Operations, Club Management, and Financing. The primary growth driver for the near term is the successful integration of the Bluegreen acquisition, which is expected to yield approximately **\$100 million in cost synergies**.

Management has guided for **high single-digit contract sales growth** in 2025 and anticipates achieving **faster bottom-line growth** than top-line growth due to these synergies and operational efficiency.

The revenue projections are built on the following conservative assumptions:

1.  **2025 Revenue:** Based on LTM Revenue of \$4,478 million, I project a conservative 6.0% growth, reflecting a modest increase following the Bluegreen integration, but caution on the high single-digit contract sales growth being fully realized in reported revenue.
2.  **2026-2030 Revenue:** Growth is tapered aggressively. Management projects "low to mid-single-digit tour flow growth in 2026", indicating organic growth moderating after the initial post-acquisition boost. The projection assumes a mature business model with declining growth toward a conservative terminal rate.

| Year | Revenue Base (2024E) | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (in millions USD) | Rationale/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024E** | \$4,478 | N/A | \$4,478 | LTM Revenue Base |
| **2025** | \$4,478 | 6.0% | **\$4,747** | Conservative estimate against "high single-digit" contract sales growth and early synergy capture. |
| **2026** | \$4,747 | 4.5% | **\$4,960** | Moderating growth, reflecting the "low to mid-single-digit tour flow" outlook after the full year of synergy benefits. |
| **2027** | \$4,960 | 3.5% | **\$5,134** | Further maturation of the combined business. |
| **2028** | \$5,134 | 3.0% | **\$5,288** | Stabilization of the core timeshare market. |
| **2029** | \$5,288 | 2.5% | **\$5,420** | - |
| **2030** | \$5,420 | 2.0% | **\$5,528** | Tapering toward the Terminal Growth Rate. |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

HGV's reported Net Income has been historically low (LTM Net Income Margin of 1.19%), heavily impacted by non-cash charges and acquisition-related costs. Management is guiding for faster bottom-line growth, primarily by realizing **\$100 million in cost synergies**.

The goal is to project a **conservative, but improving, Net Income Margin (NI%)** that reflects this synergy realization and improved operational efficiency.

#### Assumptions:

*   **Effective Tax Rate:** **25.0%** (A conservative, normalized tax rate, lower than the LTM 45.04% to reflect tax planning benefits on a more profitable base).
*   **Operating Margin (OM):** The TTM Operating Margin is ~12.37%. Given the full run-rate of synergies (\$100M) and management's guidance for "faster bottom-line growth," I project a gradual improvement in OM to **14.0%** by 2030.
*   **Initial Net Income (NI):**
    *   **Interest Expense:** A high, conservative figure of **\$350 million** (higher than the TTM \$329M) to account for high leverage in a high-rate environment. This is held constant as a conservative assumption.
    *   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Used for "additional income" from prior years' cash. The historical 3-year average ROIC is 5.33%. A conservative, forward-looking rate of **4.0%** will be used.

#### Calculation of Net Income (all values in millions USD):

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Projected Revenue** | **\$4,747** | **\$4,960** | **\$5,134** | **\$5,288** | **\$5,420** | **\$5,528** |
| **B. Operating Margin % (OM)** | 13.0% | 13.2% | 13.5% | 13.7% | 13.9% | 14.0% |
| **C. Operating Income (A * B)** | \$617 | \$655 | \$693 | \$724 | \$753 | \$774 |
| **D. Interest Expense (Assumption)** | (\$350) | (\$350) | (\$350) | (\$350) | (\$350) | (\$350) |
| **E. Pre-Tax Income (C + D)** | \$267 | \$305 | \$343 | \$374 | \$403 | \$424 |
| **F. Tax Expense (25.0%)** | (\$67) | (\$76) | (\$86) | (\$94) | (\$101) | (\$106) |
| **G. Net Income (Projected)** | **\$200** | **\$229** | **\$257** | **\$281** | **\$302** | **\$318** |
| **H. ROIC Income (4.0% of NI from prior year)** | \$0 | \$8 | \$9 | \$10 | \$11 | \$12 |
| **I. Net Income (Total) (G + H)** | **\$200** | **\$237** | **\$266** | **\$291** | **\$313** | **\$330** |

*Note: The assumption that all Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year, and the subsequent income from ROIC, is a direct implementation of the user's specific modeling rule.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The final step is to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected Net Income (Cash Flow to Equity) and the Terminal Value.

#### DCF Parameters:

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **9.0%** (Conservative, reflecting a mature, high-leverage company).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate, g):** **1.5%** (Very conservative, reflecting long-term inflation/GDP growth).

#### 2031 Terminal Value Calculation:

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2031} = \frac{\$330 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.090 - 0.015} = \frac{\$334.95}{0.075} = \$4,466 \text{ million}
$$

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:

The NPV of the Terminal Value is calculated by discounting it back to 2025 (Year 0).

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \frac{\$4,466}{(1 + 0.090)^6} = \frac{\$4,466}{1.677} = \mathbf{\$2,663 \text{ million}}
$$

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$200 | 0.917 | \$183 |
| **2026** | \$237 | 0.842 | \$200 |
| **2027** | \$266 | 0.772 | \$205 |
| **2028** | \$291 | 0.708 | \$206 |
| **2029** | \$313 | 0.650 | \$203 |
| **2030** | \$330 | 0.596 | \$197 |
| **Total NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **\$1,194 million** |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | | | **\$2,663 million** |
| **Total Equity Value (Enterprise Value - Net Debt)** | | | **\$3,857 million** |

### V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The Fair Value of the stock is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value} - \text{Total Debt} + \text{Total Cash}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD, except per share) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (from DCF)** | \$3,857 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$7,200) |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$215 |
| **Implied Equity Value (Formula Based on Rule)** | **(\$3,128)** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 86.635 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **-\$36.10** |

**Note on Valuation Formula:** The custom formula for fair value uses the **Total Equity Value** from the DCF *before* the market-standard adjustment for cash and debt to find the *final* equity value.

**Corrected Fair Value Calculation (Standard DCF Approach - to validate the result):**
*   *Standard DCF:* Equity Value = NPV of Free Cash Flow to Equity. Since our DCF directly uses **Net Income (Cash Flow to Equity proxy)**, the **Total Equity Value of \$3,857 million** is the end result.

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share (Standard DCF)} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$3,857}{86.635} = \mathbf{\$44.52}
$$

**Final Fair Value per Share (Using User's Rule-mandated Formula):**

The user-mandated formula is highly unusual in finance, as the discount rate *already* accounts for the high debt and leverage (via WACC) and the projected Net Income is already net of interest payments. Applying the final debt/cash adjustment **subtracts the entire debt load again** from the already-derived equity value, resulting in a negative valuation.

The implied instruction is to treat the **DCF result (\$3,857 million)** as the **"Enterprise Value"** of the projected cash flows (despite the model using Net Income which is conceptually for Equity Value), or to accept the negative outcome. Sticking strictly to the rule:

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share (Strict Rule)} = \frac{\text{NPV of all future cash flows (Net Income) today} - \text{Total Debt} + \text{Total Cash}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD, except per share) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A. NPV of all future cash flows (Net Income)** | \$3,857 |
| **B. Less: Total Debt** | (\$7,200) |
| **C. Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$215 |
| **D. Implied Equity Value (A - B + C)** | **(\$3,128)** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 86.635 |
| **Fair Value per Share (Strict Rule)** | **-\$36.10** |

### VI. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value per Share (Strict Rule-Mandated Result):** **-\$36.10**

**Current Market Price per Share:** **\$39.74**

#### Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Model

1.  **Fundamental Model Difference:** The negative fair value results from the strict adherence to the required formula: **$\frac{\text{NPV of NI} - \text{Debt} + \text{Cash}}{\text{Shares}}$**. This formula double-counts the debt (since Net Income is already net of interest expense) and inappropriately uses a Net Income-based DCF (which calculates *Equity Value*) and then adjusts for the total Debt, leading to a negative final equity value because HGV's **Total Debt (\$7.2B)** is significantly higher than its projected **Total NPV of Net Income (\$3.86B)**. In a standard DCF, the calculated NPV of Net Income ($\text{FCFE}$) *is* the Equity Value, leading to a share price of **\$44.52**.

2.  **Market's Implied Assumptions (Justification for the Market Price of \$39.74):**
    *   **The Market is pricing in the *Standard DCF*:** The current price of **\$39.74** is very close to the **\$44.52** result from the standard, conceptually correct Net Income DCF. The market, therefore, likely sees HGV's cash flows (or FCF) as a strong proxy for equity cash flows and is discounting them based on growth and a reasonable cost of equity/WACC.
    *   **Higher Growth/Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be projecting slightly higher growth (e.g., 5-6% Terminal Growth Rate) or a lower WACC (e.g., 8.0%) than my conservative assumptions. A $1.5\%$ higher terminal growth (3.0%) would significantly increase the NPV and close the gap.
    *   **De-risking the Debt:** The market is treating the \$7.2B in debt as primarily **non-recourse Timeshare Financing Receivable (TFR) debt** (\$2.5B), which is secured by the TFR assets and largely self-liquidating. The market is likely valuing HGV on its **Corporate Debt** (\$4.7B) rather than the total. The market effectively "writes off" the non-recourse debt against the assets it finances (TFR). My model is more conservative by including the entire liability.

**Justification for Model Difference:** The model's negative result is a **mathematical artifact** of the specified final valuation formula interacting with a company's business model (timeshare, high non-recourse debt) where NPV of Equity Cash Flow is lower than Total Debt. The conceptually sound DCF result of **\$44.52** suggests my conservative assumptions align closely with the market's current valuation, assuming the market is using a standard DCF approach.
