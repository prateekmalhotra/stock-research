## Business Summary

The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), often referred to as Scotiabank, operates by taking money deposited by customers (like savings) and lending it out as loans and mortgages at a higher interest rate; the difference between the two rates is its primary source of profit. Unlike most major Canadian banks, BNS has a strong focus on international markets, deriving significant revenue from countries across Latin America (such as Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Colombia) and the Caribbean, alongside its core business in Canada. Its customers span a wide range, including individuals needing mortgages and credit cards, affluent clients using wealth management services, and large corporations requiring commercial financing. Revenue is generated mainly through collecting interest on these loans and secondarily through various fees charged for managing investments and handling financial transactions.

## Business Model Risk

The bank faces significant near-term credit risk, meaning customers may struggle to repay loans due to high interest rates and a slowing global economy, leading to potential defaults that directly hurt earnings. A second immediate risk is interest rate risk; rapid changes in central bank rates could compress the bank's profit margins if the cost of funding (what they pay depositors) rises faster than what they charge borrowers. A key long-term risk stems from BNS's distinctive international focus. While this strategy offers high growth potential, it exposes the bank to political instability, unpredictable regulatory changes, and the risk of currency devaluation in regions like Latin America. Historically, BNS has faced volatility during economic downturns in these emerging markets, and that threat is amplified today by global inflation and rising geopolitical uncertainty, potentially harming the bank's market position compared to domestically focused competitors.

## Company History

The history of The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), widely known as Scotiabank, is a story of a small, local bank growing into a major global financial institution by strategically looking beyond its borders.

### **The Founding and Core Goal (1832)**

1.  **Inception:** The Bank of Nova Scotia was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1832, making it one of the oldest banks in Canada.
2.  **Founding Purpose (The "Why"):** The bank was established by a consortium of local business owners and citizens who sought a public and more accessible alternative to the exclusive private banks dominating the city at the time.
3.  **Initial Goal:** Its primary goal was to provide currency and credit to support the growing commercial activity in the region, particularly in fishing, lumber, farming, and trans-Atlantic trade.
4.  **Early Challenges (Headwinds):** The early years were marked by intense competition, "currency wars" between different financial institutions, and a period of slow growth. The bank also suffered a major internal crisis in 1870 with the discovery that its Chief Cashier had been stealing money for over 25 years.

### **Expansion and Early Innovation (1880s - 1950s)**

5.  **Innovative Solution (Expansion):** Following the internal scandal, the bank chose to survive and aggressively expand, first by opening new branches across the Maritime provinces and then by moving westward across Canada.
6.  **Pioneering International Strategy:** In 1889, the bank achieved a Canadian first by opening a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, starting its unique, early focus on international markets, mainly to finance the trade of sugar, rum, and fish.
7.  **Strategic Relocation:** To better facilitate its national and growing international network, the bank moved its corporate headquarters from Halifax to the burgeoning financial capital of Toronto in 1900.
8.  **Innovative Solution (Retail Banking):** In the post-WWII economic boom (a key **Tailwind**), the bank introduced the "Scotia Plan Loan" in the 1950s, a pioneering and popular consumer lending product that helped make personal loans more accessible to everyday people.
9.  **The "Gold Bank":** BNS strategically developed a niche in the precious metals market, eventually becoming known as Canada’s leading gold and silver dealer, diversifying its business and earning it the moniker "Canada's gold bank."

### **Navigating Crises and Global Footprint (1960s - 2000s)**

10. **Headwind (Political Risk):** In 1960, the political risk of international operations became clear when the government of Cuba nationalized all banks, forcing Scotiabank to close all eight of its Cuban branches.
11. **Tailwind (Canadian Stability):** The bank, along with the rest of the Canadian banking system, largely avoided the severe consequences of global crises like the **2008 Financial Crisis**, a major long-term *tailwind* attributed to Canada's more conservative regulatory environment.
12. **Innovative Solution (Risk Management):** The bank’s prudent risk management was highlighted during the 2001-2002 economic collapse in Argentina (a major **Headwind**), where it took a large financial loss but made the disciplined decision to withdraw its subsidiary from the chaos, limiting further exposure.
13. **Modern Identity:** In 1975, the bank officially adopted **Scotiabank** as its worldwide brand name to better unify its growing global presence and simplify its identity.

### **Present Day and Future Strategy (2020s)**

14. **Current Vision:** Scotiabank's modern vision is to be its clients' "most trusted financial partner and deliver sustainable, profitable growth."
15. **Major Strategic Shift (2023-2024):** Recognizing that its broad international operations were generating lower profits, the bank initiated a new strategy to focus most of its resources on the "North American Corridor"—Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean.
16. **Strategic Goal (Headwind Response):** This shift is a direct response to the **Headwind** of underperforming Latin American businesses (specifically in Peru, Chile, and Colombia), allowing the bank to focus capital on markets with high trade potential (like Mexico via the USMCA trade agreement).
17. **Four Strategic Pillars:** The new plan is supported by four pillars: 1) **Grow and scale** in its priority markets; 2) **Earn primary client relationships** (meaning clients use Scotiabank for their daily banking); 3) **Make it easy** to do business with the bank; and 4) **Win as one team** (culture/people).
18. **Commitment to Climate Change:** A key part of its new strategy is its commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, including mobilizing \$350 billion in climate-related finance by 2030, reflecting a response to the global **Tailwind** of sustainability investing.

## Moat Analysis

The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), or Scotiabank, has built a solid, long-standing moat primarily through a combination of a protected domestic market and a unique, established international presence that most of its Canadian competitors do not share.

### **Analysis of the Moat (Defensive Advantages)**

1.  **Regulated Oligopoly in Canada (Massive Barrier to Entry):** The most substantial part of BNS's moat is its place as one of the "Big Five" banks within Canada's highly concentrated and strictly regulated banking industry. This regulatory environment acts as an enormous barrier, making it nearly impossible for new players, even those with large capital, to enter and displace a major bank.
2.  **Unique Geographic Diversification (The Scotiabank Difference):** Unlike its peers who focus mainly on North America, BNS is known as Canada's most international bank, with a significant portion of its earnings historically coming from its international operations, primarily in Latin America. This diversification provides an earnings cushion when the Canadian economy slows, acting as a built-in hedge for investors.
3.  **Cross-Border Network Effects and Scale:** BNS has a strong focus on the **Pacific Alliance** countries (Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia), positioning itself as a leader in these higher-growth markets. This deep, established presence allows BNS to offer competitive cross-border financial solutions to corporate clients, a network advantage that is very difficult for competitors to replicate.

***

### **Special Positioning, Pricing Power, and Differentiation**

1.  **Differentiated Market Position:** BNS’s unique position is being the only major Canadian bank with operations in Canada, the U.S., and the Pacific Alliance countries. This strategy targets markets with favorable demographics, lower consumer debt, and higher growth potential than its mature home market.
2.  **Pricing Power through Scale and Local Expertise:** While explicit evidence of higher *prices* is limited, BNS's scale allows it to offer highly competitive products and pricing in the high-growth Latin American markets, which often have higher Return on Equity (ROE) potential than developed markets. Its established local brand and risk management expertise in these specific regions serve as a barrier to smaller, local competitors.
3.  **Hybrid Banking Model:** The acquisition of **Tangerine** (formerly ING Direct) in Canada provides a low-cost, digital-only bank channel alongside its traditional branch network. This dual-brand strategy helps capture both customers who prefer in-person service and those seeking a digital-first, lower-fee experience, giving it a lower-cost deposit advantage over traditional banks.

***

### **Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk**

1.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts:** Banking services are inherently sticky due to high switching costs for customers, such as moving chequing accounts, changing direct deposits and pre-authorized payments, and refinancing mortgages. The revenue is highly **recurring**, tied to loan interest, monthly account fees, and managed assets.
2.  **Hard to Displace by Capital Alone:** While a competitor could have more capital, they would face insurmountable regulatory barriers to acquiring a domestic banking license in Canada that would allow them to compete at the "Big Five" scale. In its international markets, BNS’s deep local knowledge, established branch networks, and brand recognition in countries like Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Colombia would require billions of dollars and many years for a new competitor to build from scratch.

***

### **Historical Growth and Innovation**

1.  **Historical Foundation for Growth:** BNS grew into its current size through a series of key domestic mergers in the early 1900s that established it as a national institution. The subsequent long-term focus has been global, with early expansion into the Caribbean (1889) and, more recently, strategic acquisitions that built its Latin American footprint, such as increasing its stake in the Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat.
2.  **Innovation and R&D Investment:** The banking sector does not have a large R&D budget in the traditional sense, but BNS must **constantly innovate** in technology and digital delivery to compete.
3.  **Digital Strategy:** The company prioritizes **digital transformation** across its footprint. This includes forming innovative partnerships with FinTech startups, especially in Latin America, to gain a competitive edge in product development, improve customer experience, and enhance cybersecurity. This focus on digitizing its service model is how it maintains its relevance and edge in an increasingly tech-driven industry.

## Catalyst Analysis

The following is an analysis of the catalysts for The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), outlining factors that may increase the stock price in the near and long term, based on recent corporate communications and management's strategy.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)**

1.  **Execution of Efficiency and Cost Control Strategy:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The new CEO has explicitly named **expense stabilization** as one of the three core strategic priorities, which includes a strategic overhaul and workforce reductions to enhance business efficiency.
    *   **Catalyst:** Continued disciplined expense management, which has resulted in positive operating leverage for several consecutive quarters, can directly boost profitability and support earnings per share (EPS) growth targets.

2.  **Increased Capital Returns to Shareholders:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The bank announced a return to dividend growth and the launch of a share buyback program (Normal Course Issuer Bid or NCIB) for 20 million shares.
    *   **Catalyst:** The buyback program provides management with "optionality to return capital to our shareholders if our valuation remains depressed" and demonstrates confidence in the bank's strong balance sheet and capital levels (CET1 ratio is 13.3%).

3.  **Positive Earnings Momentum and Guidance Achieved:**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management has reiterated confidence in achieving 5% to 7% EPS growth for fiscal 2025 and is focused on building on momentum into the second half of the year.
    *   **Catalyst:** Meeting or exceeding this short-term EPS growth guidance will validate the multi-year turnaround strategy and likely lead to a positive re-rating of the stock.

4.  **Balance Sheet Repositioning and Net Interest Income (NII) Growth:**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management cited a "substantial balance sheet repositioning" that has set up the bank for better Net Interest Income (NII) growth.
    *   **Catalyst:** An expanding Net Interest Margin (NIM) due to lower funding costs and favorable deposit mix, driven partly by central bank rate cuts, is a direct source of higher revenue.

---

### **Long-Term Catalysts (1-3+ Years)**

1.  **Success of Strategic Organic Growth and Client Deepening:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The second key strategic priority is **organic growth**, centered on increasing the primary client base and deepening client relationships through cross-selling. The bank has added 392,000 net new retail primary clients since the strategy launch.
    *   **Catalyst:** Programs like "Mortgage+" are successfully driving multi-product relationships, a key factor in improving customer lifetime value and long-term, sticky revenue growth.

2.  **Profitability Improvement in International Banking (Pacific Alliance):**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management is focused on a regionalization strategy and has stated that International Banking results are "trending ahead of our investor day commitments," with an improved profitability Return on Equity (ROE) of 15% in Q3 2025.
    *   **Catalyst:** Continued successful execution of the "Pacific Alliance" strategy in core Latin American markets (Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia) will diversify earnings away from the Canadian economy and provide access to higher growth emerging markets.

3.  **Achievement of Medium-Term ROE Target:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The CEO stated the bank is "steadfast in our focus to achieve 14%-plus ROE over the medium-term."
    *   **Catalyst:** Hitting this Return on Equity target, which is significantly higher than recent performance, is the ultimate measure of the strategic turnaround's success and would likely bring the stock valuation in line with top-tier peers.

4.  **Growth from Digital and Payments Transformation:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The third core strategic priority is **payments transformation**, supported by an annual tech investment of \$2.5 billion, with two-thirds focused on growth initiatives like cloud and AI utilization.
    *   **Catalyst:** These technology investments aim to simplify architecture, lower the cost-to-serve, and enhance client experience, which is expected to drive franchise growth and strengthen fee growth trends over time.

## Management Record

The management analysis of The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) is presented below, focusing on the current and previous CEO, key strategies, and shareholder value delivery.

### **I. L. Scott Thomson: Current CEO & Future Strategy (Appointed February 2023)**

1.  **CEO Background and History:** L. Scott Thomson, appointed President and CEO in February 2023, came from a non-banking operational background, having previously served as President and CEO of Finning International Inc., a large heavy equipment dealer. He has prior financial experience, including time at Goldman Sachs, and served on the BNS board as a director since 2016, providing an "outsider-insider" perspective.
2.  **Management Change Context:** His appointment was considered "surprising" and "anomalous" for a Canadian Big Five bank, which typically promote from within, signaling that the board desired a "major shakeup" and "major change" following a period of disappointing total shareholder return.
3.  **Future Strategy and Vision (The "North American Quarter"):** The core strategy, unveiled at the 2023 Investor Day, is to focus investment on the "North American Quarter": **Canada first, U.S. second, and Mexico third**, by allocating approximately 90% of incremental capital to these priority businesses.
4.  **Key Decisions & Strategic Focus:** Thomson is actively redeploying capital from volatile, developing markets to developed, higher-return markets. Key decisions include the merger/consolidation of Latin American assets (Panama, Costa Rica, and Colombia) and acquiring a nearly 15% stake in U.S. regional bank KeyCorp. The goal is to shift from a "volume-led" to a "value-led" approach, emphasizing capital-light businesses like wealth management, and improving the bank's overall efficiency.

5.  **Performance and Delivery:** The CEO has stated the bank is making progress and "did what we said we were going to do" for multiple consecutive quarters, reporting increased Return on Equity (ROE) as an important metric for shareholders. Early results have shown momentum, including improvements in deposit growth and better-than-expected quarterly results, suggesting the strategy is gaining traction.
6.  **Popularity & Investor Perception:** While the appointment was initially a surprise, investor response to the formal turnaround plan has been largely positive, with analysts noting the plan's potential for profitable growth. The strategy of moving away from risky Latin American markets is seen by some investors as a necessary and "great 5 year plan."

### **II. Brian Porter: Previous CEO & Track Record (2013 - January 2023)**

7.  **Previous Tenure and Strategy:** Brian Porter served as CEO from November 2013 to January 2023. His strategy centered on building BNS's presence in the Pacific Alliance countries of Latin America, a move to position the bank as "Canada's most international bank."
8.  **Key Decisions & Track Record:** During his tenure, Porter streamlined the bank's footprint by exiting 25 unrated or sub-investment grade countries and made significant acquisitions to boost wealth management in Canada (Jarislowsky Fraser and MD Financial Management) and international banking (BBVA Chile).
9.  **Shareholder Value Delivery & Management Change:** Despite a long tenure, the bank's stock was "essentially flat" over the latter decade, with the generous dividend being the main source of shareholder return. This underperformance, and recognition that the bank "had not delivered the level of total shareholder return that our shareholders should expect," created the pressure leading to his retirement and the choice of an external successor.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of The Bank of Nova Scotia's (BNS) management incentives and compensation, primarily through its 2024 Management Proxy Circular (the equivalent of a DEF 14A for a Canadian company), here is a summary of the structure and conclusion on management's alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Required Holdings (Alignment Factor: Mixed/High Deferred)**

1.  **Direct Common Share Ownership is Low:** Publicly available aggregate data often shows a low percentage of direct common share ownership by management and directors, which is typical for large, widely held banks.
2.  **Required Ownership is High:** The executive team and directors are subject to rigorous **share ownership guidelines**, which require them to hold a significant multiple of their base salary in BNS equity. For example, the President and CEO has a requirement of 8x his base salary in BNS equity, which he currently exceeds or is on track to meet.
3.  **Equity Includes Deferred Units:** The required holdings include common shares, Deferred Share Units (DSUs), and Performance Share Units (PSUs), meaning a large portion of their personal wealth is directly tied to the bank's long-term stock price performance.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure (Alignment Factor: High)**

1.  **High Variable and Long-Term Weighting:** The executive compensation structure is heavily weighted toward variable and long-term incentives, directly aligning pay with performance. For a Named Executive Officer (NEO), the actual compensation mix is often predominantly made up of long-term equity, such as 64% in Performance Share Units (PSUs) and total variable compensation around 92% of pay.
2.  **Performance Share Units (PSUs) for Long-Term Value:** The long-term incentive plan uses Performance Share Units (PSUs), which vest over a three-year period and pay out based on performance metrics, ensuring executives are rewarded for sustained, multi-year value creation.
3.  **Performance Metrics are Comprehensive:** The metrics for incentive compensation are not limited to just short-term financial results; they incorporate a "business performance factor" that includes strategic goals, risk scorecards, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors like customer score, employee engagement, and strong governance.
4.  **Risk Mitigation and Clawback:** The compensation system includes risk governance oversight, with a mechanism that allows for incentive payouts to be reduced, even down to zero, if the bank's performance is significantly below expectations or if the executive is involved in misconduct.

### **Conclusion: Incentive to Act in the Interest of Shareholders**

The Bank of Nova Scotia's management has a **strong incentive to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders**.

*   The compensation structure is overwhelmingly skewed toward **long-term equity (PSUs)** that have a three-year vesting period and are earned based on multi-year, sustainable performance, including financial and non-financial metrics.
*   The high **required share ownership multiples** mean executives must maintain a significant personal investment in BNS shares (or share-equivalent units) for their tenure, directly linking their personal net worth to the appreciation of the company's stock price.
*   While direct common share ownership is not high, the significant portion of compensation that is restricted or deferred equity provides the necessary alignment to discourage short-term gain at the expense of long-term shareholder value.

## Price History

The price history and technical analysis for The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) reveal the following:

1.  **Current Price Position:** As of the latest available data (October 17, 2025), The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) is trading at a price of **$89.32 CAD** on the TSX.
2.  **Distance from 52-Week Low:** The stock's 52-week low is **$62.57 CAD**. The current price of $89.32 CAD is approximately **42.75%** above its 52-week low, indicating the stock is *not* trading low based on its yearly range.
3.  **Technical Analysis:** Technical indicators present a mixed picture, suggesting BNS is not trading low; one analysis notes the stock is actually trading **near its 52-week high** of $91.47 CAD. While some moving averages show "Bullish" signals, a summary of various indicators often registers a **"Sell"** or **"Strong Sell"** outlook, primarily based on shorter-term moving averages and oscillators like the MACD and RSI.
4.  **Recent Upward Momentum (Big Gains):** The stock has experienced a significant uptrend in recent months, which was notably supported by **strong Q3 2025 financial results**. The bank beat analyst expectations with a 13.5% increase in revenue and 15% higher adjusted earnings year-over-year, which helped put aside less money for loan-loss provisions.
5.  **Past Big Drop:** A notable drop occurred following the **fiscal Q4 2024 earnings release** (around December 2024), where the stock dived by as much as 4.8% intraday due to the earnings missing analyst estimates. The primary reasons for this drop were a **significant $379 million impairment charge** on an investment and an increase in provisions for credit losses on impaired loans.
6.  **Turnaround & Peer Comparison:** The stock had lagged its peers for a decade but is showing signs that new management's restructuring efforts and focus on improving domestic operations and optimizing the balance sheet are starting to be reflected in the price. Despite recent gains, BNS had still lagged some peers over the year (e.g., up 22% vs. TD's 50% as of an earlier report).

---

## Long Thesis

Scotiabank is undergoing a necessary and strategic turnaround led by new management, which will unlock significant shareholder value that has been depressed by years of underperformance. The bull case is that BNS will successfully transform from a scattered global bank into a highly focused, highly efficient institution centered on the profitable North American Corridor (Canada, US, and Mexico). In the near term, aggressive cost cutting, large share buybacks, and stabilizing interest rates will boost immediate profit per share. Over the long term, scaling back volatile international operations and focusing capital on high-growth areas like Mexico, while deepening client relationships in Canada, will drive the bank's core profitability measures (Return on Equity) back up to peer-leading levels (14%+). This improved efficiency, combined with its protected domestic market position, will lead the market to finally recognize its true value, resulting in a strong re-rating of the stock price.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The new management team successfully executes its complex restructuring plan, achieving targeted efficiency gains and expense reductions without disrupting core business functions. Economic stability holds in key international markets, especially Mexico, ensuring continued high growth without significant currency or political crises. Provisions for loan defaults (credit losses) remain manageable and do not negate the gains from cost cutting and revenue growth. Central banks begin to cut interest rates modestly, which stabilizes the bank's funding costs and allows lending margins to expand. Finally, the stock market eventually rewards the achieved targets for profitability and efficiency by valuing the bank similarly to its top-tier Canadian peers.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies holes and faults in the long thesis for The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), leading to a countervailing bear case.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **The Return on Equity (ROE) Target Gap is Massive:** The bull case anticipates a re-rating based on BNS achieving a "peer-leading" ROE of 14%+, but the bank's adjusted ROE of **12.4%** in Q3 2025 remains significantly below top-tier peers, such as Royal Bank of Canada's adjusted ROE of **17.7%** in the same quarter. The size of this performance gap makes achieving "peer-leading" status a multi-year, high-risk undertaking, not a near-term catalyst for a stock re-rating.
2.  **The Interest Rate Assumption is Directly Contradicted by Management's Stance:** The bull case assumes that "Central banks begin to cut interest rates modestly," which would stabilize funding costs and allow margins to expand. However, Scotiabank's CEO has explicitly stated the bank is preparing for a scenario of **"higher for longer"** interest rates, which suggests continued pressure on funding costs and a more challenging environment for net interest income.
3.  **Core Canadian Business Growth is Weak, Undermining the Foundation:** The strategy's primary focus on "deepening client relationships in Canada" has yet to materialize as a reliable growth engine, with the bank's Canadian Banking adjusted earnings actually **slipping 2% year-over-year** in Q3 2025. This signals that the most stable and "protected domestic market position" is struggling to generate the necessary momentum to fund the global restructuring.
4.  **"High-Growth" Mexico Focus is Exposed to Political and Trade Risk:** The thesis touts Mexico as a key high-growth area, yet the bank's management has indicated they are adopting a cautious "wait-and-see" approach on deploying new capital to Mexico due to uncertainty regarding a new administration and looming geopolitical trade tensions. This introduces significant political and economic risk to the bank's central growth driver.
5.  **Execution Risk and Long-Term Timeline are Underestimated:** The bull case anticipates an "immediate" boost from cost cutting and near-term re-rating. However, the CEO described the overhaul as a **"long-term journey"** and confirmed the bank is only seven quarters into a complex, multi-year strategic repositioning. The risk of execution failure, technology integration setbacks, and the difficulty of optimizing a sprawling international footprint will likely continue to create volatility.
6.  **Credit Loss Provisions Remain a Headwind:** While provisions for credit losses (PCL) improved sequentially in Q3 2025, the overall PCL remains substantial at C$1.04 billion, and management is still prepared for higher PCLs going forward. The assumption that credit losses will remain "manageable" may be overly optimistic given the high consumer indebtedness in Canada and the economic uncertainty in their key international markets.

***

### Bear Case Thesis: The Long and Arduous Turnaround

The Scotiabank bull case drastically underestimates the execution risk, time horizon, and macroeconomic headwinds facing its deep-rooted structural issues. A significant, multiple-expanding re-rating will not occur until the bank delivers sustained, peer-level profitability targets, which is a distant and difficult goal.

1.  The bank's attempt to transform into a high-efficiency institution is **seven quarters into a decade-long process**, meaning operational and restructuring costs will continue to weigh on earnings and efficiency ratios, offsetting gains from share buybacks and revenue growth.
2.  BNS will remain a **second-tier Canadian bank** for the foreseeable future, as its current ROE of 12.4% is far below the peer-leading levels (e.g., RBC at 17.7%), which will justify the continuation of its current discount valuation by the market.
3.  The core domestic engine is **faltering**, with Canadian Banking earnings declining, signaling that the promised "deepened client relationships" are not translating into a stable, high-growth foundation to support the volatile international shift.
4.  The key high-growth lever, **Mexico, is a major source of non-financial risk**, as capital deployment is being delayed or slowed due to political uncertainty and trade policy risks, preventing the "highly focused" strategy from generating the promised exponential returns.
5.  A "higher for longer" interest rate environment, which management is preparing for, will **continue to stress margins and drive higher loan loss provisions**, directly contradicting the bull thesis's core assumption of stabilizing rates and delaying any significant profit per share boost.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the debate around Scotiabank's stock (BNS) is now clearly defined by the successful execution of the turnaround versus persistent, multi-year headwinds.

Your next steps should focus on quantifying the specific financial gaps and stress-testing the key pillars of the new strategy to fully address the critiques in the Bear Case.

Here are the important questions left unanswered and the next steps for investigation:

### **Next Steps to Investigate for The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)**

1.  **Quantify the Current Valuation Discount vs. Canadian Peers**
    *   **Question:** What are BNS's current forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and Price-to-Book (P/B) multiples compared to Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), TD Bank (TD), Bank of Montreal (BMO), and CIBC (CM)?
    *   **Why:** The Long Thesis relies on a **"strong re-rating"** of the stock. By calculating the exact discount (or premium) BNS currently trades at, you can quantify the potential upside if the turnaround plan is successful and the bank achieves its target Return on Equity (ROE). BNS's forward P/E was recently reported around 11.0 to 13.52, which is below its historical P/E of 11.7 and the P/E range of its peers, who trade from 13.7x (CIBC) to 19.4x (TD), quantifying the value case.

2.  **Benchmark Credit Quality and Loan Loss Provisions (PCL)**
    *   **Question:** How does BNS’s Provision for Credit Losses (PCL) ratio (55 basis points in Q3 2025) and net charge-off rate compare directly to the average of its Big Five Canadian peers in the most recent quarter?
    *   **Why:** The Bear Case highlights that Credit Loss Provisions remain a headwind, and BNS still has a large exposure to the Canadian consumer. A direct, peer-to-peer comparison of credit metrics will determine if BNS is managing its risk prudently or if its credit quality is structurally weaker than its competitors.

3.  **Analyze the True Status of the Key Growth Market: Mexico**
    *   **Question:** What are the most recent (Q4 2025 or later) political and economic updates coming out of Mexico, and how have recent regulatory or election results influenced the bank's plan to deploy new capital there?
    *   **Why:** The Long Thesis relies heavily on Mexico as a high-growth corridor, while the Bear Case cites *political and trade risk*. Directly investigating the current geopolitical landscape and new administration's policies will confirm or deny the execution delay risk mentioned by management.

4.  **Deep-Dive into the Canadian Banking Segment's Weakness**
    *   **Question:** What is the precise Return on Equity (ROE) for the Canadian Banking segment in Q3 2025, and what were the main drivers for the reported 2% year-over-year earnings slip?
    *   **Why:** The Bear Case argues the "core domestic engine is faltering," which is critical, as this segment should be the most stable. Isolating its ROE and the source of the earnings decline (e.g., lower loan growth, compressed margins, or higher non-interest expenses) is essential to judge the effectiveness of the *client-deepening* strategy.

5.  **Assess Dividend Sustainability and Capital Flexibility**
    *   **Question:** Given the $1.10 quarterly dividend in 2025, what is the *latest* calculated dividend payout ratio, and is this ratio trending up or down?
    *   **Why:** For many investors, BNS is a dividend stock. While the dividend appears sustainable with a robust CET1 ratio of 13.3% and a payout ratio recently reported as low as 47% or as high as 65%, tracking the trend is vital. If the payout ratio creeps up significantly, it signals increased pressure on earnings and could reduce the capital available for the crucial share buyback program.
