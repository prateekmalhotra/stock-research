### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

Fiserv's business engine is driven by two primary segments: **Merchant Solutions** (including the high-growth Clover platform) and **Financial Solutions** (including core banking and payments). The company is currently undergoing a strategic "One Fiserv" action plan, which involves a "critical investment and transition year" in 2026, intended to re-focus on client service, expand high-margin platforms like Clover, and leverage AI/embedded finance for long-term growth. This plan involves sacrificing near-term growth for long-term recurring, high-quality revenue.

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Revenue (Millions USD) | Justification (Based on Management Guidance) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 3.75% | **\$21,228** | Midpoint of the drastically *slashed* 2025 organic revenue growth guidance (3.5% to 4.0%), reflecting a difficult transitional year with a headwind from the Argentina economy and a strategic reset. |
| **2026** | 3.00% | **\$21,865** | Conservative low-end of "low single-digit organic revenue growth" guidance for the "critical investment and transition year." The focus is on *fixing* past competitive/service gaps through CapEx, which dampens immediate revenue. |
| **2027** | 7.00% | **\$23,396** | Projected rebound. Management targets "double-digit adjusted EPS growth starting in 2027". This is driven by organic growth, operating leverage, and buybacks. A 7.0% organic revenue growth is a conservative, but strong, rebound, fueled by the accelerating success of Clover (26% Q3 growth) and the completion of the "transition year" investments. |
| **2028** | 6.50% | **\$24,916** | The high-growth Clover platform moderates its expansion slightly, and Financial Solutions begins to stabilize with new tech platforms, resulting in a moderate step-down. |
| **2029** | 6.00% | **\$26,411** | Growth continues to normalize toward a mature, large-scale, diversified payments provider rate. |
| **2030** | 5.50% | **\$27,864** | Final year of projection, reflecting a healthy, stable growth rate for a leader in the global fintech market. |

### **III. Margin and Net Income Projections**

The company's goal is to achieve double-digit EPS growth through margin expansion and share repurchases. We will use Net Income Margin as the basis for projecting earnings, starting from the 2024 GAAP base.

**Margin and Net Income Assumptions:**

*   **2025 Net Income Margin:** Slight compression to **13.7%** (from ~14.2% in 2024), reflecting the impact of investments and the strategic reset, consistent with the guidance of an adjusted EPS being cut/flat.
*   **2026 Net Income Margin:** Further compression to **13.5%** (20 bps decline) to reflect the explicit "critical investment and transition year" with costs prioritized over short-term earnings, and adjusted EPS expected to be "down modestly."
*   **2027-2030 Net Income Margin:** Assumed annual expansion of **50 bps** per year. This is a conservative measure of the promised operating leverage from the "One Fiserv" plan, new leadership, and AI integration (Project Elevate).
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** **8.0%**. This is a conservative yet reasonable long-term ROIC for a mature, capital-intensive technology and payments company actively allocating capital through share buybacks.

**Projected Net Income Calculation:**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Inc. Margin (B) | Base Net Income (C) = A * B | ROIC from Previous Cash (D) | Total Net Income (E) = C + D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$20,460 | 14.2% | - | - | **\$2,904 (Base)** |
| **2025** | \$21,228 | 13.7% | \$2,908 | (\$2,904 * 8.0%) = \$232 | **\$3,140** |
| **2026** | \$21,865 | 13.5% | \$2,952 | ((\$2,904 + \$3,140) * 8.0%) = \$484 | **\$3,436** |
| **2027** | \$23,396 | 14.0% | \$3,275 | ((\$2,904 + \$3,140 + \$3,436) * 8.0%) = \$758 | **\$4,033** |
| **2028** | \$24,916 | 14.5% | \$3,613 | ((\$2,904 + \$3,140 + \$3,436 + \$4,033) * 8.0%) = \$1,081 | **\$4,694** |
| **2029** | \$26,411 | 15.0% | \$3,962 | ((\$2,904 + \$3,140 + \$3,436 + \$4,033 + \$4,694) * 8.0%) = \$1,457 | **\$5,419** |
| **2030** | \$27,864 | 15.5% | \$4,329 | ((\$2,904 + \$3,140 + \$3,436 + \$4,033 + \$4,694 + \$5,419) * 8.0%) = \$1,890 | **\$6,219** |

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The final step is to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected Net Income (used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow as per the model rules) and the Terminal Value.

**Valuation Parameters:**

*   **Discount Rate (r):** 9.0% (A conservative, mid-range Cost of Equity for a stable, large-cap technology company.)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 3.0% (A conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above global inflation.)

**Net Present Value of Forecast Period (2025-2030):**

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (E) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 9.0%)^t) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | \$3,140 | 0.9174 | \$2,880 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | \$3,436 | 0.8417 | \$2,892 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | \$4,033 | 0.7722 | \$3,115 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | \$4,694 | 0.7084 | \$3,326 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | \$5,419 | 0.6499 | \$3,522 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | \$6,219 | 0.5963 | \$3,711 |
| **NPV of Forecast Period** | | | **\$19,446** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (as of EOY 2030):**

Using the Gordon Growth Model:
Terminal Value (TV) = [2030 Net Income * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
TV = [\$6,219 * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.09 - 0.03)
TV = \$6,406 / 0.06 = **\$106,767 million**

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value:**

NPV of TV = TV / (1 + r) ^ t
NPV of TV = \$106,767 / (1 + 0.09)^6
NPV of TV = \$106,767 * 0.5963 = **\$63,680 million**

**Total Enterprise Value (TEV):**

TEV = NPV of Forecast Period + NPV of Terminal Value
TEV = \$19,446 million + \$63,680 million = **\$83,126 million**

---

### **V. Fair Value Calculation**

Fair Value is derived from the Equity Value:

Equity Value = TEV + Total Cash & Equivalents - Total Debt
Equity Value = \$83,126 + \$2,765 - \$30,200 = **\$55,691 million**

Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$55,691 million / 537.85 million shares = **\$103.54**

---

### **VI. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share:** **\$103.54**
**Current Market Price:** **\$65.615**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$103.54** is significantly higher (a **57.8%** premium) than the current market price of \$65.615.

#### **Justification for the Divergence:**

The market is making a different set of assumptions from this model, primarily driven by the catastrophic guidance reset in Q3 2025. The substantial difference is due to the market pricing in **fear and an extended period of underperformance**, while the model assumes **management executes on its long-term plan.**

1.  **Market Focus on Near-Term Failure:** The Q3 2025 announcement saw a massive guidance cut, slashing organic revenue growth from ~10% to 3.5%-4.0% and an explicit warning that 2026 will be a "critical investment and transition year" with low single-digit growth and a modest EPS decline. The market is punishing the stock for what it perceives as two consecutive years of growth failure and unreliability from a company that has a heavy debt load.
2.  **Model's Faith in Long-Term Turnaround:** This valuation model takes the management's guidance on the chin for 2025 and 2026 but gives them credit for the projected rebound starting in 2027. The key assumptions that drive the high Fair Value are:
    *   **Successful Margin Expansion:** The model assumes an achievable 50 basis points of annual Net Income Margin expansion post-2026, which is crucial for achieving the "double-digit EPS growth" goal. The market is skeptical of this margin recovery given the need for significant, deferred investments.
    *   **Healthy Terminal Value:** A **3.0%** Terminal Growth Rate and **9.0%** Discount Rate implies that Fiserv, after the transition, will be a healthy, profitable, growing franchise. The market, shaken by the guidance cut, may be using a lower Terminal Growth Rate (e.g., 1-2%) or a higher Discount Rate (e.g., 10-12%) to reflect higher risk and lower long-term potential.
    *   **High ROIC:** The 8.0% ROIC on accumulating Net Income is a key multiplier. If the market believes management will continue to invest capital poorly (the core reason for the guidance cut), they would assign a much lower ROIC, severely reducing the intrinsic value.

**In summary, the market is currently pricing Fiserv as a business that is in long-term secular decline or one whose management will fail to execute its "One Fiserv" turnaround plan and achieve the promised operating leverage. This model prices Fiserv as a business that successfully executes its turnaround, navigates the 2025/2026 investment period, and re-emerges as a solid, mid-single-digit growth, high-margin fintech leader by 2027.**
