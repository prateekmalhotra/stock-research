## Business Summary

ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) operates as a specialty lender focused on commercial real estate (CRE) across the United States. It does not own buildings directly; instead, the core business model involves providing large, senior loans (debt financing) to owners and developers of commercial properties such as apartments, hotels, and office buildings. ACR earns revenue primarily through interest income generated by these loans. To fund these activities, ACR typically borrows capital at lower short-term rates and lends it out at higher long-term rates, earning a profit on the difference (net interest margin). Their customers are other businesses, specifically real estate developers, institutional investors, and property owners seeking capital for acquisitions or refinancing existing debt.

---

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk stems from rising interest rates, which increase ACR’s own borrowing costs and make it difficult for their customers to service or refinance their existing high-rate loans, potentially leading to increased loan defaults. This specific threat is concerning now because the rapid pace of rate hikes since 2022 has stressed commercial property values and refinancing markets globally, echoing credit risks seen during the 2008 financial crisis. A key long-term risk is structural decline in specific CRE sectors, such as office space due to sustained remote work trends, which could cause the value of the collateral (the building) to drop significantly. If a borrower defaults, ACR may seize an asset worth less than the loan amount, harming earnings and requiring write-downs. Lastly, since ACR relies heavily on borrowing to fund its lending activities, a tightening of the credit markets or capital availability could severely restrict their ability to originate new profitable loans and harm their market position.

## Company History

This history of ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) will explain its origins, its business model, and the challenges it overcame, all in simple, jargon-free terms.

### **Inception and Core Purpose (2005 to Present)**

1.  **Founding and Structure:** The company was incorporated in 2005, initially under the name **Resource Capital Corp.**.
2.  **The Main Goal (Why it was founded):** The business was created to operate as a **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)**, which is a company that owns, and in this case, finances, income-producing real estate.
3.  **REIT Advantage:** By structuring as a REIT, the company avoids paying federal corporate income tax, provided it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders. This makes its main goal to provide shareholders with overall good returns through quarterly cash distributions and potential growth in the stock price.
4.  **Core Business: Middle-Market Lending:** ACR's specific focus is on providing "transitional" commercial real estate (CRE) loans, typically ranging from about $10 million to $100 million. These loans fund the purchase or repositioning of properties like apartment buildings, hotels, or offices while they are being fixed up or stabilized.
5.  **Income Generation:** The company makes its money on the "spread," which is the difference between the interest income it earns from the loans it gives out and the lower cost it pays to finance those loans.

### **The Journey: Name Changes and Management Shifts**

1.  **First Rebrand (2016):** The company changed hands and was rebranded from Resource Capital Corp. to **Exantas Capital Corp.** (XAN), where new management focused the business primarily on transitional CRE lending.
2.  **The ACRES Era Begins (2020):** In August 2020, **ACRES Capital, LLC** took over the job of managing the company. The goal of this new management team was to create a "one-stop shop" for middle-market commercial real estate borrowers.
3.  **Current Name (2021):** To reflect the new manager and strategic direction, the company changed its name to **ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR)** in February 2021.

### **Headwinds, Challenges, and Innovative Solutions**

1.  **The 2020 Crisis (The Headwind):** Under its previous name, the company had expanded into a type of asset called Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS), financing them with short-term, daily value-based debt. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, liquidity dried up, and the company faced "margin calls," forcing it to sell many of those investments quickly at a significant loss.
2.  **Rescue and Restructuring (The Solution):** To survive the crisis and stabilize the business, the company secured "rescue financing" from major investors (Oaktree and Mass Mutual). This allowed the company to weather the storm and transition to the new ACRES management.
3.  **Refocus on the Core (Innovative Solution):** The new management team immediately shifted the company's focus *back* to being a straightforward transitional CRE lender. They moved away from the complex assets that caused the 2020 crisis and concentrated on loans for property types they understood well, especially multifamily housing.
4.  **Ongoing Challenges (Real Estate Market Volatility):** Like any real estate financier, the company constantly deals with risks like interest rate changes, potential loan defaults, and swings in property values.
5.  **Risk Management (Adaptive Solution):** They handle these risks by diversifying investments across different property types and locations, performing careful checks on potential borrowers, and using financial tools to protect against sudden interest rate changes. They also proactively sell off or manage any loans that are not performing well.

### **Current Tailwinds and Future Direction**

1.  **Banking Gap (The Tailwind):** A major advantage for ACR is that traditional banks have significantly reduced their lending to the transitional commercial real estate market. This creates less competition and a larger pool of borrowers for companies like ACR to lend to.
2.  **Focusing on Opportunity (Innovative Strategy):** While many competitors focus heavily on apartment buildings, ACR is actively looking for good loan opportunities in other areas, such as retail, hotels, and student housing, especially where property values have become more reasonable in major cities following the pandemic.
3.  **Capital Efficiency (The Solution):** The company is continuously working to make its financing cheaper and more flexible. A key method is using a strategy called **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)**, which is a way to package many loans together and sell bonds against them to secure long-term, low-cost funding.
4.  **Goal for the Future:** The company intends to continue growing its loan portfolio by investing in high-growth markets nationwide, with a significant growth target planned for the coming years.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," of ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) is not built on massive scale or breakthrough technology but on specialized expertise, relationship capital, and strategic positioning in a specific segment of the commercial real estate lending market.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and differentiation:

### **Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Niche Market Specialization (The Core Moat):** ACRES concentrates on the **"middle market"** for commercial real estate (CRE) lending, focusing on loans typically in the $\$10$ million to $\$75$ million range. This market is often underserved and fragmented, as it is too small for the largest institutional banks and too complex for many smaller lenders, allowing ACR to be a dominant force in this specific niche.
2.  **The "One-Stop Shop" Advantage:** The company strives to provide a seamless, end-to-end financing platform for a property's entire life cycle—from initial value creation/construction loans to bridge loans, and finally to long-term permanent financing. This comprehensive service, which keeps the borrower within the ACRES ecosystem for many years, is a key differentiator from lenders who only offer one type of loan.
3.  **Deep Industry Expertise and Relationships:** The primary soft moat is built on deep **Industry Expertise** and **Established Relationships** with developers, borrowers, and brokers across the country. In commercial lending, these personal relationships are vital for sourcing high-quality deals that are often not found through a public process.

### **Pricing Power and Special Position**

4.  **Limited Pricing Power due to Competition:** The overall commercial real estate lending market is highly competitive, facing strong rivals including banks, insurance companies, and other real estate investment trusts (REITs). This intense competition limits ACR’s ability to demand significantly higher interest rates (pricing power).
5.  **Special Position for Speed and Certainty:** While overall pricing power is limited, the company’s reputation for expertise and a streamlined process—promising swift analysis and certainty of execution—gives it a special position for borrowers with complex, time-sensitive middle-market deals. This efficiency can allow them to command better terms than a less agile competitor.

### **Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk**

6.  **The Reason for Growth (The Foundation):** The company's current form and focus were solidified when ACRES Capital acquired the external management contract in 2020/2021, strategically shifting the company's focus to build a leading, integrated platform for middle-market CRE lending.
7.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** As a lending business, a new competitor with significantly **more capital** could certainly enter the market and underwrite a larger volume of loans. However, to truly displace ACR, the new entrant would have to spend years replicating ACR's sophisticated "one-stop shop" platform, building a competitive reputation for speed and certainty, and forging the necessary deep broker and borrower relationships.

### **Customer Stickiness and Moat-Building Activities**

8.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts:** The core revenue comes from interest income on commercial mortgage loans, which are contracts that provide **recurring revenue** for the loan's term, which can range from 1 to 15 years. The strategy of providing an "end-to-end" solution for an asset's entire life cycle is specifically designed to create high customer stickiness, where a borrower moves from one ACR loan product to the next.
9.  **Moat-Building Activities:** The company’s strategic actions to solidify its moat include continuously securing new financing facilities to ensure a flexible capital base, which is crucial for a lender's stability, and focusing on portfolio quality and strategic capital recycling. They are also concentrating on building a technology platform to enhance **ease of use** for borrowers, which helps improve deal flow.
10. **No Traditional R&D or Network Effects:** The company does not invest in traditional research and development (R&D) like a technology firm. The need for **innovation** lies in constantly structuring new financial products and improving its lending process platform to maintain its edge in speed and service, not in lab-based invention. ACR relies heavily on powerful **relationships and expertise**, which are often mistaken for "network effects," but it does not have the classic network effect where the value of the platform automatically increases for every user who joins.

## Catalyst Analysis

ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) catalysts center on its deliberate strategy of recycling capital, growing its high-quality loan portfolio, and maximizing shareholder value through book value accretion.

### Catalysts for Stock Price Increase

#### Near-Term Catalysts (Management Focus)

1.  **Strategic Share Repurchases:** The board reauthorized an additional \$7.5 million for share repurchases, with management highlighting that buying back common shares at a significant discount to book value directly enhances shareholder value.
2.  **Asset Sales and Capital Recycling:** The company is executing its strategy of selling select real estate investments, such as the Q3 2025 sale that resulted in a \$13.1 million gain, and then promptly redeploying those funds into new loans.
3.  **Book Value Growth:** The success of the capital recycling strategy and repurchasing shares at a discount contributed to a book value per share increase from \$27.93 to \$29.63 in Q3 2025, a metric the market reacted positively to.
4.  **Portfolio Repositioning:** Management is nearly complete with the goal of selling assets and redeploying the gains, which is expected to "get the company on track to maximize income and EAD (Earnings Available for Distribution)" in the near term.

#### Long-Term Catalysts (Management Strategy)

1.  **High-Quality Loan Origination:** Management intends to grow its loan portfolio by "investing in high-quality loan opportunities" and expects to produce positive growth in the portfolio for the full year 2025.
2.  **Focus on Defensive Assets:** The company's loan portfolio is heavily weighted towards multifamily properties (about 75%), which management sees as a "defensive" and "resilient place to be" in the current market environment.
3.  **Earnings Available for Distribution (EAD) Improvement:** Management expects the EAD profile to "trend up" in the coming periods as they complete asset transactions, refinance their securitizations (CLOs), and reinvest the proceeds into the CRE loan book.
4.  **Monetizing Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryforwards:** Utilizing the deferred tax assets and NOL carryforwards, such as through the strategic asset sales, is a part of the long-term plan to maximize shareholder value.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of ACRES Commercial Realty Corp.'s (ACR) structure, compensation, and insider ownership, the following are the key findings regarding management incentives:

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation**

1.  **External Management Structure:** ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) operates as an **externally managed** REIT, meaning its executive officers are employees of its manager, ACRES Capital, LLC. This structure is crucial because the executive team's direct compensation is paid by the Manager, whose main source of revenue is the management fees paid by ACR, rather than a traditional salary/bonus structure paid directly by the REIT.

2.  **Incentive Management Fee (Variable Compensation):** The Manager receives an **incentive management fee** that is calculated as 20% of the amount by which the company's Earnings Available for Distribution (EAD) for the previous 12 months exceeds a certain hurdle rate. EAD is an adjusted earnings metric, linking a portion of the Manager's pay directly to a measure of the REIT's financial profitability, which can align with shareholder interests.

3.  **Low Direct Insider Ownership:** The President and CEO, Mark S. Fogel, directly owns a very small percentage of the company's shares, at approximately **0.094%**. Low direct equity ownership by the top executive diminishes the incentive to act solely in the interest of the common shareholder, as personal wealth is not strongly tied to share price performance.

4.  **Manager's Affiliate Ownership:** ACRES Share Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of the manager (ACRES Capital, LLC), is a significant shareholder, holding 966,347 shares. This affiliate ownership provides a secondary incentive for the Manager to act in the interest of common shareholders, as its own investment value is at stake.

### **Conclusion on Alignment with Shareholder Interests**

*   **Mixed Alignment:** The incentive structure presents a **mixed alignment** with shareholder interests. The 20% of EAD performance fee encourages management to focus on financial results and grow the base for distributions, which is generally positive for shareholders.

*   **Risk of Misalignment (Structural):** However, the fundamental external management structure combined with the CEO's very low direct personal stake ($0 compensation from ACR) means the primary focus may shift. The Manager is incentivized to **grow assets** (to increase the **base management fee**, which is not tied to EAD/performance) and generate EAD (for the incentive fee), which can lead to rapid expansion or high-risk investments that increase the Manager's fees even if the long-term benefit to the share price or total shareholder return is suboptimal.

*   **Final Assessment:** While the EAD-based incentive fee is a positive mechanism, the low direct insider ownership by top management (like the CEO) combined with the inherent conflicts of the **externally managed REIT model** suggests that the management is incentivized to line the Manager's pockets (via management fees) first, which may only partially overlap with maximizing long-term common shareholder value.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR) price history and recent technical signals, here are the key points:

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock's current price of approximately $21.71 (as of November 10, 2025) is near its 52-week high of $23.81 and significantly above its 52-week low of $14.94.
2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **45.31%** above its 52-week low of $14.94.
3.  **Technical Analysis Status:** The stock is **not trading low** based on short-term technical indicators. Technical analysis shows the stock is currently "overbought on RSI14" and positioned in the upper part of its recent trend, which is a signal that a short-term correction might be likely.
4.  **Mixed Technical Signals:** Despite the short-term "overbought" signal, a positive sign comes from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which has issued a buy signal.
5.  **Big Upward Movement:** The stock has been "up bigly" in the last few years, with a dramatic **196% gain over the last five years** and a notable **36% total shareholder return in the last twelve months** (as of November 2025).
6.  **Reason for Long-Term Growth:** This strong performance is primarily attributed to the company's fundamental shift **from a loss to profitability** over the five-year period, which has boosted market enthusiasm for the stock.
7.  **Recent Positive Developments:** The stock has seen positive momentum due to recent corporate actions, including the announcement of a **share repurchase program** reauthorization and the reporting of its Third Quarter 2025 results.

## Long Thesis

ACR is poised for significant growth because it successfully repositioned itself as a specialized lender filling a vacuum left by traditional banks that are pulling back from funding middle-market commercial real estate (CRE) projects. In the near term, the company is actively enhancing shareholder value by selling off non-core assets and aggressively buying back its own stock, which is currently priced below its true value (book value). This strategic use of capital is expected to accelerate per-share earnings growth. For the long term, ACR's strong management team, which successfully turned the company profitable, is focused on building a large, high-quality loan portfolio, heavily weighted toward resilient assets like apartment buildings. This expertise, combined with reduced competition and a focus on operational efficiency, should lead to continuously increasing profits (Earnings Available for Distribution) and sustained growth in company value.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that traditional banks will continue to limit lending to the transitional CRE market, allowing ACR to maintain high pricing power and easily source new, profitable loans in its underserved niche. Secondly, the economy must stabilize enough to prevent widespread defaults in the current loan portfolio, particularly within the large multifamily segment. Management must successfully execute its capital recycling plan, hitting its stated portfolio growth targets, and the high-quality assets they underwrite must perform as expected, ensuring stability even if specific CRE sectors (like offices) decline further. Finally, the external management structure, despite potential inherent conflicts, must continue prioritizing the growth of Book Value and distributable earnings.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

Based on ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR)'s recent financial reports and current CRE market conditions, here is a critique identifying the holes and faults in the bullish thesis.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **1. Flawed Premise on Reduced Competition and High Pricing Power**

*   **The Flaw:** The thesis assumes a near-monopoly due to bank pullback, but the transitional CRE lending space is already saturated with formidable competition.
    *   The market vacuum created by traditional banks pulling back is rapidly being filled by highly competitive **private credit funds, debt funds, and other mortgage REITs** (mREITs), not just ACR.
    *   Signs of high competition are already visible: Middle-market spreads are falling, with direct lenders increasingly accepting tighter spreads (e.g., 450–475 basis points). This undercuts the assumption of ACR's sustained "high pricing power."
    *   In fact, CRE lending momentum is rising, as seen by a surge in the CBRE Lending Momentum Index in Q1 2025, suggesting that the broader market is stabilizing and other lenders are returning to activity.

#### **2. Transient Boost to Earnings Available for Distribution (EAD)**

*   **The Flaw:** The thesis points to "continuously increasing profits (Earnings Available for Distribution)," but recent performance was heavily reliant on non-core asset sales.
    *   The significant EAD result in Q3 2025 was primarily driven by a **large, non-recurring $13.1 million capital gain** from the sale of a single real estate asset. This gain obscures the performance of the core lending business and is not sustainable for "continuously increasing profits."
    *   Management's strategy of selling non-core assets to utilize its Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforwards is a **finite event**. Once the NOLs are significantly depleted and non-core assets are sold, the growth of distributable earnings must be fully supported by new loan origination, which has been inconsistent.

#### **3. Failure to Achieve Consistent Portfolio Growth**

*   **The Flaw:** The thesis assumes "aggressively buying back its own stock" while "building a large, high-quality loan portfolio," but capital is being diverted from growth.
    *   Despite management's stated goal of portfolio expansion, the company reported a **net reduction** in its loan portfolio in Q3 2025 (a $46.8 million decrease) as payoffs and sales outpaced new investments. This contradicts the "building a large" portfolio objective in the immediate term.
    *   Aggressive share buybacks, while accretive to Book Value per Share (BVPS), divert capital that could be used for new, profitable loan origination, slowing the growth of the underlying asset base and making the "accelerate per-share earnings growth" contingent only on reducing the share count.

#### **4. Understated Risks in the Multifamily and Transitional CRE Portfolio**

*   **The Flaw:** The core assumption that the economy will "stabilize enough" to prevent defaults and that multifamily is a "resilient asset" is challenged by rising sector distress.
    *   The overall commercial real estate debt market is seeing a rise in loan delinquencies, reaching the highest rate in a decade in Q4 2024.
    *   Crucially, the **multifamily segment,** which the thesis emphasizes as "resilient," has been a driver of increasing distress, with delinquency rates for CMBS multifamily loans jumping by nearly 75% in 2024. The distress rate on CRE CLO loans, a common funding vehicle for transitional lending, also reached 10.8% in July 2024.
    *   ACR's own portfolio quality has slightly degraded, with the weighted average risk rating modestly *increasing* to 3.0 in Q3 2025. This suggests the "high-quality assets" are under stress from higher interest rates, which pressures borrower debt service coverage ratios and property valuations.

#### **5. Inherent Conflicts of Interest in External Management**

*   **The Flaw:** The thesis assumes the external manager "must continue prioritizing the growth of Book Value and distributable earnings," but the structure is explicitly conflicted.
    *   The management agreement explicitly acknowledges that the external manager (ACRES Capital) faces **conflicts of interest** regarding the allocation of investment opportunities, which may not be resolved in the REIT's favor.
    *   This conflict is a persistent risk that can incentivize the manager to pursue deals that maximize management fees over those that maximize shareholder return and Book Value, directly undermining the core assumption of management's incentive alignment.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (ACR)**

ACR's investment strategy is fundamentally flawed due to a failure to scale its core lending business amid rising portfolio risk and a deeply conflicted management structure.

1.  **Core Lending Growth is Stalled and Unreliable:** Despite claims of a "strong pipeline," ACR's loan portfolio saw a net decrease in Q3 2025, indicating that strategic asset sales and loan payoffs are outpacing new, profitable origination. Future Earnings Available for Distribution (EAD) will struggle to grow from core operations, as the recent spike in EAD was a non-recurring event driven by a one-time capital gain from a non-core asset sale.
2.  **Multifamily Sector Vulnerability is Underpriced:** The reliance on "resilient" multifamily properties ignores rising systemic risk, as CMBS multifamily delinquency balances have significantly increased throughout 2024. ACR's own weighted average risk rating slightly deteriorated in Q3 2025, which, combined with the presence of specific credit loss reserves, signals mounting pressure on its transitional loans from elevated interest rates and tighter debt-service coverage.
3.  **Competition and Pricing Power Erosion:** The "vacuum" left by traditional banks is an illusion of opportunity, as non-bank competitors like private debt funds and other mREITs are aggressively entering the middle-market CRE space, leading to falling loan spreads and intense competition. This limits ACR's ability to maintain high pricing power and attractive risk-adjusted returns on new loans, constraining future profit margins.
4.  **External Management Conflict and Discount Persistence:** The steep, sticky discount of the stock price to Book Value (P/B ratio is around 0.34) suggests that the market fundamentally distrusts the reported Book Value and the external management structure. This distrust is warranted given the manager's inherent and disclosed conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities, which prioritizes the parent company's growth and fees over sustained, non-dilutive Book Value per Share growth for ACR shareholders.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, you have successfully identified the core arguments for the long and bear cases, confirmed key financial metrics, and validated major risks. The next steps should focus on quantifying the remaining risks and opportunities and directly challenging management's forward-looking statements.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps to investigate:

### **Quantify the Remaining "Hidden" Value and Risk**

1.  **What is the Composition and Estimated Value of Remaining Non-Core Assets?**
    *   **Goal:** Management claims the process of selling non-core assets to generate gains (like the \$13.1M one) is "nearly complete," but the exact value of the remaining pool is unknown.
    *   **Action:** Search the Q3 2025 Balance Sheet/Notes to the Financial Statements for the line item "Investments in real estate" or "Real Estate Owned (REO)" to find the remaining book value of these assets, which totaled **\$143.0 million** at one point, including properties held for sale.
    *   **Why it Matters:** This will determine the maximum possible future non-lending EAD boost and the extent of non-core assets still on the books.

2.  **What is the Specific Nature of the Highest-Risk Loans?**
    *   **Goal:** To understand the severity of the market's P/B discount and the *real* risk to Book Value.
    *   **Action:** Try to identify the property type, location, and par value of the **13 loans rated 4 or 5** and the specific assets backed by the **\$4.7 million in specific credit loss reserves**. If not publicly disclosed, research which property types in ACR's high-exposure regions (Southwest, Southeast) are under the most stress.
    *   **Why it Matters:** This will test the management's claim of "sound underwriting" against tangible portfolio weakness in the context of rising CMBS/CRE CLO multifamily delinquencies.

### **Challenge Management's Core Strategy**

3.  **Can New Originations Sustain EAD Growth Without One-Time Gains?**
    *   **Goal:** To test the viability of the core lending business now that the non-core gains are expiring.
    *   **Action:** Calculate the *run-rate* EAD/share by subtracting the **non-recurring gain (approximately \$1.30/share)** from the Q3 EAD of **\$1.01/share** (which results in a loss or near-zero EAD). Then, model what volume of new, profitable loans (\$300M to \$500M target) is required to offset this loss and achieve a sustainable, positive EAD/share.
    *   **Why it Matters:** The bullish thesis rests on "continuously increasing profits," but the Q3 results suggest the core lending profits (Net Interest Income) are currently insufficient to cover operating expenses.

4.  **How Does the Competition's Pricing Compare to ACR's Spreads?**
    *   **Goal:** To test the "Limited Pricing Power" claim.
    *   **Action:** Find the current average investment spread (e.g., SOFR + X bps) for ACR's main public competitors (other mREITs like Starwood Property Trust, Blackstone Mortgage Trust, etc.) and compare them directly to ACR's weighted average spread of **SOFR + 3.63%**.
    *   **Why it Matters:** If ACR's spread is significantly lower, it directly proves the bear case that competition is eroding margins and limiting pricing power in their niche.

### **Investigate the Structural Risk**

5.  **Are There Specific Examples of Manager Conflict of Interest or Related-Party Transactions?**
    *   **Goal:** To find tangible evidence that validates the market's P/B discount related to governance risk.
    *   **Action:** Review SEC filings (10-K, Proxy Statements) for the section "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" to find past instances of transactions, fee waivers, or investment allocations between ACR and **ACRES Capital Corp.** (the parent of the Manager), especially concerning asset sales or loan origination, given the explicit disclosure of a conflict.
    *   **Why it Matters:** The market often discounts the Book Value of externally managed REITs due to this inherent conflict; finding specific examples of disadvantageous transactions would confirm this major structural risk.
