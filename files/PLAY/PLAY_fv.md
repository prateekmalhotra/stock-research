### II. Business Engine, Revenue, and Margin Projections

The valuation is built on a conservative model of the company's "back-to-basics" strategy, which focuses on organic growth (new stores), same-store sales recovery, and margin expansion through operational efficiencies.

#### A. Business Engine and Revenue Drivers

The primary drivers of revenue growth are:
1.  **New Store Openings (Domestic):** New unit growth is a core component of the business model, which management states generates "high returns on new unit investment".
    *   **FY 2025 Guidance:** 11 new domestic stores (Dave & Buster's and Main Event). The total number of company-owned stores was 241 at the end of Q3 2025.
    *   **Conservative Assumption:** Assuming a sustained, conservative annual new unit growth of **5%** for domestic stores for all projected years (2026-2030), slightly lower than the $\approx 4.8\%$ new store growth in FY2025 (11 new stores / 230 stores at start of FY2025).
2.  **Same-Store Sales (SSS) Growth:** This is the most crucial, yet volatile, driver. Management noted Q3 2025 comparable store sales decreased 4.0% but with sequential improvement (October comps down only $\approx 1\%$) and positive food & beverage comps. The "back-to-basics" plan aims to address past "execution missteps".
    *   **Conservative Assumption:**
        *   **FY 2025:** Will be negative due to year-to-date performance. We will conservatively project a **-1.0% SSS** (factoring in the late-year sequential improvement being offset by earlier declines).
        *   **FY 2026-2030:** A conservative and gradual recovery, projecting SSS of **1.0%** in 2026, **1.5%** in 2027, and **2.0%** thereafter, reflecting improved operations and marketing but acknowledging competition and economic headwinds.
3.  **International Franchise Revenue:** Management expects "highly efficient incremental growth" and has agreements for over 35 committed stores.
    *   **Conservative Assumption:** Assume an annual **$5$ million** in incremental, high-margin royalty/franchise fees starting in 2026, reflecting the small base of franchise fees in the overall revenue mix.

#### B. Revenue Projections (in millions USD)

| Year (Fiscal Year End) | New Store Growth (%) | New Store Impact (Est.) | SSS Growth (%) | Total Revenue Growth (%) | Projected Total Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual)** | N/A | N/A | -7.2% | -3.3% | $2,132.7$ |
| **FY 2025** | $\approx 4.8\%$ | $4.8\%$ | -1.0% | $3.8\%$ | $2,213.7$ |
| **FY 2026** | $5.0\%$ | $5.0\%$ | $1.0\%$ | $6.0\%$ | $2,346.5$ |
| **FY 2027** | $5.0\%$ | $5.0\%$ | $1.5\%$ | $6.5\%$ | $2,499.0$ |
| **FY 2028** | $5.0\%$ | $5.0\%$ | $2.0\%$ | $7.0\%$ | $2,674.0$ |
| **FY 2029** | $5.0\%$ | $5.0\%$ | $2.0\%$ | $7.0\%$ | $2,860.2$ |
| **FY 2030** | $5.0\%$ | $5.0\%$ | $2.0\%$ | $7.0\%$ | $3,058.4$ |

*   *Note: Total Revenue Growth = (1 + New Store Growth) * (1 + SSS Growth) - 1. For simplicity, the New Store Impact is approximated to be equal to the growth % and SSS is a multiplier on the prior year's base. International revenue contribution is small and is embedded in the overall growth rate.*

#### C. Margin Projections

Management commentary highlights the high-margin nature of the entertainment business (65.2% of FY2024 revenue with an 8.5% cost of entertainment). The "back-to-basics" plan is focused on "significantly improved... Adjusted EBITDA" and margin expansion.

*   **FY 2024 Net Income Margin (Actual):** 2.7% ($58.3M / $2,132.7M)
*   **FY 2025 YTD (Q3) Net Income Margin (Actual):** -0.6% ($9.0M Loss / $1,573.2M YTD Revenue)

Given the current Net Loss in Q3 2025 YTD, a conservative approach is mandatory. We will assume a slow but steady recovery to a sustainable long-term Net Income Margin of **5.0%**, which is below the company's historical highs but above the troubled FY2024 level.

| Year | Projected Total Revenue (M USD) | Assumed Net Income Margin (%) | Projected Net Income from Revenue (A) (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $2,213.7$ | $1.5\%$ | $33.2$ |
| **FY 2026** | $2,346.5$ | $3.0\%$ | $70.4$ |
| **FY 2027** | $2,499.0$ | $4.0\%$ | $99.9$ |
| **FY 2028** | $2,674.0$ | $4.5\%$ | $120.3$ |
| **FY 2029** | $2,860.2$ | $5.0\%$ | $143.0$ |
| **FY 2030** | $3,058.4$ | $5.0\%$ | $152.9$ |

#### D. ROIC and Incremental Income

We must use a conservative, reasonable ROIC. Using the FY2024 SEC data:
*   Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) is a proxy for the earnings generated by the invested capital. FY2024 Operating Income was $220.4M. Assuming a conservative 25% tax rate, NOPAT = $220.4M * (1 - 0.25) = $165.3M.
*   Invested Capital is Net Debt + Equity. FY2024 Net Long-Term Debt was $1,479.1M. Equity was $145.8M. Total Invested Capital = $1,479.1M + $145.8M = $1,624.9M.
*   Historical ROIC $\approx$ $165.3M / $1,624.9M $\approx$ $10.17\%$.

For a **conservative valuation**, we will assume an ROIC of **5.0%** (a reasonable positive rate below the historical figure).

*   **Net Income for Next Year** = Projected Net Income from Revenue + ROIC from Previous Year's Accumulated Cash (Assumed Net Income).
*   *Note: Net Income for the previous year is assumed to go straight into "cash" (retained earnings) for investment.*

| Year | Projected Net Income from Revenue (A) (M USD) | Previous Year's Net Income (Accumulated Cash) (B) (M USD) | ROIC on (B) (5.0%) (C) (M USD) | Projected Net Income (A) + (C) (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Base)** | N/A | $58.3$ | N/A | N/A |
| **FY 2025** | $33.2$ | $58.3$ | $2.9$ | $36.1$ |
| **FY 2026** | $70.4$ | $94.4$ ($58.3 + 36.1$) | $4.7$ | $75.1$ |
| **FY 2027** | $99.9$ | $169.5$ ($94.4 + 75.1$) | $8.5$ | $108.4$ |
| **FY 2028** | $120.3$ | $277.9$ ($169.5 + 108.4$) | $13.9$ | $134.2$ |
| **FY 2029** | $143.0$ | $412.1$ ($277.9 + 134.2$) | $20.6$ | $163.6$ |
| **FY 2030** | $152.9$ | $575.7$ ($412.1 + 163.6$) | $28.8$ | $181.7$ |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a conservative (high) discount rate to account for the company's negative SSS trend, execution risk in its "back-to-basics" turnaround, and the cyclical nature of the entertainment industry.
    *   **Conservative Discount Rate:** **10.0%**

2.  **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** This represents the conservative, perpetual growth rate of the business after the projection period. For a mature restaurant/entertainment chain, this should be a low rate close to or below long-term GDP growth and inflation.
    *   **Conservative Maturity Rate:** **2.0%**

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Income for each year is used as the proxy for free cash flow to equity (FCFE), as per the prompt's instruction.

| Year | Projected Net Income (FCF) (M USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $36.1$ | $0.909$ | $32.8$ |
| **FY 2026** | $75.1$ | $0.826$ | $62.0$ |
| **FY 2027** | $108.4$ | $0.751$ | $81.4$ |
| **FY 2028** | $134.2$ | $0.683$ | $91.7$ |
| **FY 2029** | $163.6$ | $0.621$ | $101.6$ |
| **FY 2030** | $181.7$ | $0.564$ | $102.5$ |
| **NPV of Explicit Forecast Period** | | | **$472.0$** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after the forecast period (post-2030).

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{\text{FY2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$181.7 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$185.3 \text{M}}{0.08} = \$2,316.3 \text{M}$$

#### D. Terminal Value Present Value

The Present Value of the Terminal Value is discounted back to the present (FY2024 end, or t=0).

$$\text{PV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{FY2030}}$$

$$\text{PV of Terminal Value} = \$2,316.3 \text{M} \times 0.564 = \$1,306.4 \text{M}$$

#### E. Enterprise and Equity Value

| Metric | Value (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** | $1,778.4$ |
| *(NPV of Forecast Period + PV of Terminal Value)* | *($472.0 + 1,306.4$)* |
| **Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $13.6$ |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $1,552.8$ |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$239.2$** |

### IV. Fair Value Per Share and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share** = $\frac{\text{Total Fair Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

**Fair Value Per Share** = $\frac{\$239.2 \text{ million}}{34.68 \text{ million shares}} = **\$6.89$ per share**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$6.89** |
| **Current Market Price (Jan 23, 2026)** | **$20.54** |
| **Difference** | **-66.55%** |

### V. Justification and Market Assumptions

The calculated fair value of **$6.89 per share** is significantly lower (approximately 66% lower) than the current market price of $20.54 per share. This large discrepancy requires a strong justification based on the divergence between the conservative assumptions used in this DCF and the assumptions the market is likely embedding in the current stock price.

#### 1. Why the Fair Value is So Low (Conservative Assumptions):

1.  **Conservative Same-Store Sales (SSS) Growth:** The model projects a very slow recovery to only **2.0% SSS** growth by 2028. The current market is likely pricing in a **much sharper turnaround** and a return to the company's historical pre-acquisition/pre-pandemic high-single-digit SSS growth, or at least a quicker path to $3-4\%$ SSS.
2.  **Conservative Net Income Margin:** The model projects a long-term Net Income Margin of only **5.0%**. The market is likely anticipating the management's "back-to-basics" plan to successfully drive significant cost efficiencies and margin expansion, perhaps expecting a return to pre-pandemic margins closer to **8-10%**, especially given the high gross margins on entertainment revenue (65.2% of FY2024 revenue with 8.5% cost of entertainment).
3.  **Conservative ROIC:** The model uses a conservative **5.0% ROIC** on retained earnings. The market is likely assuming that new store openings will deliver the "historically high ROIs" that management mentions, which would imply an ROIC closer to the calculated historical rate of **$10-12\%$,** significantly boosting future projected net income.
4.  **High Discount Rate:** A 10.0% discount rate is aggressive for a cyclical but established brand. The market may be using a lower WACC, reflecting an anticipated lower cost of debt/equity and less risk attached to the successful execution of the turnaround plan.

#### 2. Justification for the Market Price:

The market's current price of **$20.54** is fundamentally betting on the success of the new CEO's strategic shift and the realization of synergistic benefits from the Main Event acquisition.

The market's implied assumptions must be:
*   **Rapid & Robust SSS Recovery:** The market is likely assuming SSS growth will reach $\mathbf{+4\%}$ to $\mathbf{+5\%}$ in the near term (2026/2027) as the marketing engine is "rebuilt" and operational "missteps" are "unwound".
*   **Significant Margin Expansion:** The market is assuming the Net Income Margin will rapidly expand to $\mathbf{8\%}$ or higher, driven by the high-margin entertainment focus and disciplined capital spending ("eliminating inefficient spend").
*   **Sustained High-ROI Growth:** The market assumes domestic new store growth will be sustained at $5\%+$ and that the **International Franchise agreements** (over 35 stores committed) will begin contributing meaningful, high-margin royalty revenue very soon.

**Conclusion:**

This valuation suggests that **Dave & Buster's stock is significantly overvalued** at its current price based on highly conservative but reasonable financial and operational assumptions. The market is pricing in a **"perfect execution" turnaround story** where same-store sales and profitability bounce back quickly to pre-pandemic or optimized levels, which carries substantial risk given the current negative SSS trends and recent operational difficulties. The low fair value of **$6.89** reflects the risk that the "back-to-basics" plan underperforms and that the company reverts to a low-growth, low-margin profile while being saddled with considerable debt.
