### **II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions**

The business engine for Dave & Buster's is driven by two main levers:
1.  **New Unit Growth:** The company has two primary brands (Dave & Buster's and Main Event) and focuses on opening new, high-return units (40%+ returns on new stores).
2.  **Comparable Store Sales (SSS):** Driving traffic and spend at existing stores through remodels and new game attractions.

#### **A. Revenue Projection Engine**

**1. New Store Growth (New Unit Revenue)**
*   **Base Store Count (EOP FY2024):** The total store count at the end of Q2 2025 was 237. We will assume 240 stores at the beginning of FY 2025.
*   **New Stores per Year:** Management guided for opening 10-12 new stores in FY2025.
    *   **Assumption:** **11 new stores per year** (midpoint of guidance) from FY2025 to FY2030.
*   **Average Unit Volume (AUV) for New Stores:** Assuming new stores generate $10.0 million in annualized revenue, a conservative estimate compared to pre-COVID high AUVs.
*   **New Store Revenue per Year:** $10.0 million * 11 stores = $110 million added annually.

**2. Same Store Sales (SSS) Growth (Existing Unit Revenue)**
*   **Latest Trend:** SSS declined by -3.0% in Q2 2025. Management targets a long-term SSS growth of 3%.
*   **Conservative SSS Assumption:** We will be conservative, assuming the SSS recovery is slower than management's long-term goal.
    *   **FY2025:** **0.0%** (Assumes stabilization after a year of negative comps).
    *   **FY2026:** **1.0%** (A minor recovery due to remodels and new games).
    *   **FY2027 onwards:** **2.0%** (A sustained, conservative long-term growth rate, still below management's 3% target).

**3. Base Revenue (FY 2024 Estimate)**
*   **FY 2024 Estimate:** Based on the run-rate of the last four reported quarters, and adjusting for seasonality, we conservatively project the full-year FY 2024 Revenue (ending Jan 2025) to be **$2,160 million**.

#### **B. Margin Projection**

*   **Historical Net Income Margin (FY2022):** $137.1 million Net Income / $2.0 billion Revenue = **6.86%**.
*   **Latest Net Income Margin (Q2 2025):** $11.4 million Net Income / $557.4 million Revenue = **2.04%**.
*   **Conservative Margin Assumption:** Given the recent margin pressure (Q2 2025 margin of 2.04%), we project a gradual recovery to a long-term Net Income Margin of **5.0%**, which is below the historical high of 6.86% to account for operating pressures.

| Year | Assumed Net Income Margin |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | 3.0% |
| **FY2026** | 4.0% |
| **FY2027** | 4.5% |
| **FY2028 - FY2030** | 5.0% |

#### **C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) & Cash Flow Assumption**

*   **Historical ROIC:** For FY 2022, Net Income was $137.1M. Total Invested Capital (Approximation of Total Debt + Equity) was high due to the Main Event acquisition. Given the complexity and volatility, we will use a conservative ROIC assumption instead of a historical calculation.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** We assume a conservative **5.0% ROIC** on the *previous year's accumulated net cash*. This is a conservative return for a mature, capital-intensive restaurant/entertainment model.
*   **Cash Flow Assumption:** Net Income is assumed to go directly into cash for the next year (as per instructions).

#### **A. Revenue and Net Income Projection (FY2025 - FY2030)**

| Year | Base Revenue (Previous Year) | SSS Growth | SSS Revenue | New Store Revenue (11 units) | Projected Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Est)** | | | | | **$2,160** | | |
| **FY2025** | $2,160 | 0.0% | $2,160 | $110 | **$2,270** | 3.0% | **$68.1** |

*Note: Revenue figures in millions USD, Net Income figures in millions USD.*

#### **B. Cash Flow Projection with ROIC Principle**

The Net Cash Flow (NCF) for the valuation is calculated as:
*NCF* = *Net Income for the Year* + *ROIC on Previous Year's Accumulated Cash*

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) | Previous Year's Acc. Cash (B) | ROIC (5.0%) (C) | Net Cash Flow (A+C) | Accumulated Cash (End of Year) | NPV of NCF (10% Discount) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | $68.1 | $12.0 | $0.6 | **$68.7** | $80.7 | $62.5 |
| **FY2026** | $96.1 | $80.7 | $4.0 | **$100.1** | $180.8 | $74.6 |
| **FY2027** | $115.2 | $180.8 | $9.0 | **$124.2** | $305.0 | $83.6 |
| **FY2028** | $136.1 | $305.0 | $15.3 | **$151.4** | $456.4 | $91.8 |
| **FY2029** | $144.3 | $456.4 | $22.8 | **$167.1** | $623.5 | $94.6 |
| **FY2030** | $152.7 | $623.5 | $31.2 | **$183.9** | $807.4 | $94.0 |

*Note: All figures in millions USD.*

#### **C. Discount Rate and Terminal Value**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%** (Reflects the company's high debt load and operating volatility, making it a riskier investment than a low-volatility consumer staple).
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **1.5%** (A rate well below long-term GDP growth, reflecting a highly mature and competitive leisure market).

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
We assume the Net Cash Flow for FY2030 ($183.9M) will grow at the maturity rate (g).

$TV = NCF_{2030} \times (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)$
$TV = \$183.9M \times (1 + 0.015) / (0.10 - 0.015) = \$186.7M / 0.085 = \$2,196.5 million$

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV_TV):**
$NPV\_TV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^{\text{Year}}$
$NPV\_TV = \$2,196.5M / (1.10)^6 = \$1,240.2 million$

#### **D. Total Net Present Value**

*   **NPV of Explicit Cash Flows (FY2025-FY2030):** $62.5 + $74.6 + $83.6 + $91.8 + $94.6 + $94.0 = **$501.1 million**
*   **NPV of Total Future Cash Flows (NPV\_FCF):** $501.1M + $1,240.2M = **$1,741.3 million**

### **IV. Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Total Future Cash Flows (NPV\_FCF)** | $1,741.3 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $1,340.0$ |
| **Plus: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $12.0$ |
| **Equity Value** | **$413.3 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $34.67$ million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$11.92** |

### **V. Justification and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Value | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$11.92** | **$25.41** | **-53.0%** |

#### **Justification for Difference (Fair Value vs. Market Price)**

My calculated Fair Value of **$11.92** is significantly lower than the market price of approximately $25.41. The market is making a much more optimistic assumption about the company's future growth and/or profitability, or it is using a substantially lower discount rate.

The divergence is primarily due to the following conservative assumptions in my DCF model:

1.  **Conservative Revenue Growth (SSS):** I assumed SSS would only recover to **2.0%** long-term, well below the management's target of 3%. The market is likely pricing in a swifter and more robust recovery in comparable store sales, believing the recent negative SSS is transient and that the combined D&B/Main Event strategy will yield better results.
2.  **Conservative Profit Margin:** I projected the Net Income Margin to recover to a mature **5.0%**, which is below the company's historical 6.86% (FY2022). The market likely believes the company's focus on high-margin entertainment and disciplined cost control will restore margins closer to, or even exceed, past performance. A 6.0% long-term Net Income Margin would significantly boost the valuation.
3.  **High Discount Rate:** A 10.0% discount rate is appropriate given the company's high debt load (Net Total Leverage Ratio of 3.2x as of Q2 2025) and recent operating volatility (Net Income down significantly YoY in Q2 2025). The market might be using a lower WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), perhaps closer to 8.0-9.0%, which would increase the NPV substantially.
4.  **Total Debt:** Using a conservative debt figure of **$1.34 billion** (which is lower than some analyst-quoted figures of $3B+) benefits the calculated Equity Value. If the true total debt is closer to the higher figures, the Fair Value per Share would be even lower, suggesting the market is making an even *more* aggressive assumption about future cash flow than currently calculated.

**Conclusion on Market's Assumptions:** The market is clearly assuming that the company will successfully execute its strategic plan of new store openings, aggressive remodels, and marketing initiatives to hit its long-term **3% SSS growth target** and simultaneously restore its **Net Income Margin to at least 6.0%** (a 1% margin increase changes the entire outcome), thereby generating a significantly higher terminal cash flow than projected under a conservative case.
