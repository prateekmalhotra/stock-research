#### **B. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

Match Group's revenue is primarily driven by its two largest brands: **Tinder** and **Hinge**, and a portfolio of **Other Brands** (including Match, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Azar, etc.). The overall business engine relies on: (1) **Tinder stabilization** via RPP growth offsetting Payer decline, and (2) **Hyper-growth at Hinge** for net portfolio expansion.

| Year | Tinder Direct Revenue (Growth %) | Hinge Direct Revenue (Growth %) | Other Brands Direct Revenue (Growth %) | Total Revenue |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2024 (E)** | $1,970 (1%) | $548 (39%) | $1,018 (3%) | **$3,536** |
| **2025 (P)** | $1,990 (1.0%) | $685 (25.0%) | $1,048 (3.0%) | **$3,723** |
| **2026 (P)** | $2,010 (1.0%) | $822 (20.0%) | $1,079 (3.0%) | **$3,911** |
| **2027 (P)** | $2,030 (1.0%) | $945 (15.0%) | $1,111 (3.0%) | **$4,086** |
| **2028 (P)** | $2,050 (1.0%) | $1,039 (10.0%) | $1,144 (3.0%) | **$4,233** |
| **2029 (P)** | $2,071 (1.0%) | $1,091 (5.0%) | $1,178 (3.0%) | **$4,340** |
| **2030 (P)** | $2,091 (1.0%) | $1,146 (5.0%) | $1,213 (3.0%) | **$4,450** |

***Justification for Revenue Projections:***

*   **2024 Estimated (Base):** Based on management's full-year 2024 Total Revenue growth guidance of approximately 4% Y/Y on 2023 revenue of $3.4B (resulting in $3,536M). Hinge's Q3/Q4 2024 guidance of 25%-35% Y/Y growth is used to estimate its 2024 revenue at $\sim\$548M$.
*   **Tinder (Conservative Growth):** Tinder has faced Payer declines (down 8% Y/Y in Q2 2024) which are largely offset by strong RPP growth (up 10% Y/Y in Q2 2024). We assume the Payer base is near a trough, and RPP growth will lead to a conservative, stable **1.0% Y/Y Direct Revenue growth** starting in 2025. This assumes a marginal net positive from monetization efforts barely offsetting user stabilization/slow decline.
*   **Hinge (Decelerating Hyper-Growth):** Management stated Hinge is on track to become a **$1 billion revenue business**. Given its 2024 run rate of $\sim\$548M$, this valuation conservatively projects Hinge to reach the **$1 Billion mark by 2027**, implying a strong but rationally decelerating CAGR of 25%, 20%, and 15% through 2027, followed by a slowdown to **5.0%** to reflect market saturation and maturity. This is a deliberate moderation of the "rocket ship" growth to be conservative.
*   **Other Brands:** Other Brands have generally grown slowly. We assume a modest, consistent **3.0% Y/Y Direct Revenue growth**, reflecting incremental improvements in a fragmented group of mature and emerging apps.

#### **C. Margin and Financial Flow Assumptions**

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Terminal |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Net Income Margin** | 18.0% | 20.0% | 22.0% | 23.0% | 24.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% |
| **ROIC on Retained Cash** | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | N/A |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 10.0% |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 2.0% |

***Justification for Margin and Rates:***

*   **Net Income Margin:** The company guided to a 36% Adjusted Operating Income (AOI) margin for 2024 and aims for a 3-point expansion to 39% by 2027. Given the difference between OI (24% in Q2 2024) and AOI, which accounts for stock-based compensation (SBC), amortization of intangibles, and other adjustments, Net Income (GAAP) will be significantly lower. A conservative Net Income Margin starting at **18.0% in 2025 and rising to 25.0% by 2030** reflects improving operational leverage, the benefits of the targeted AOI expansion, and the assumption that SBC and amortization will become a smaller percentage of a growing revenue base.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** As a capital-light software business with strong Free Cash Flow generation (FCF of $829M in 2023), a $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ ROIC on retained cash is a conservative, yet reasonable, projection.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ is a standard, conservative estimate for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for a mature, profitable, but not yet fully stable, technology company operating in a competitive and evolving market.
*   **Maturity Rate (g):** $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ is a very conservative terminal growth rate, reflecting the expected long-term growth rate of a mature business, likely aligning with long-term global GDP/inflation.

### **II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**

The Net Income is assumed to be the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for this simplified DCF model, following the rule: *Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.*

| (USD Millions) | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A. Revenue (P)** | $3,723 | $3,911 | $4,086 | $4,233 | $4,340 | $4,450 |
| **B. NI Margin (Assumed)** | 18.0% | 20.0% | 22.0% | 23.0% | 24.0% | 25.0% |
| **C. NI from Operations (A * B)** | $670 | $782 | $899 | $974 | $1,042 | $1,113 |
| **D. Cash from Prior Year (NI)** | $0 | $670 | $1,452 | $2,351 | $3,325 | $4,367 |
| **E. Income from ROIC (D * 10%)** | $0 | $67 | $145 | $235 | $333 | $437 |
| **F. Total Net Income / FCFE (C + E)** | **$670** | **$849** | **$1,044** | **$1,209** | **$1,375** | **$1,550** |
| **G. Discount Factor (10.0%)** | 0.909 | 0.826 | 0.751 | 0.683 | 0.621 | 0.564 |
| **H. Discounted FCFE (F * G)** | **$609** | **$700** | **$784** | **$826** | **$855** | **$874** |

**Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** $609 + $700 + $784 + $826 + $855 + $874 = **$4,648 million**

#### **III. Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)**

The terminal value represents the value of all future cash flows beyond 2030.

*   **Terminal FCFE (2031):**
    $$FCFE_{2031} = FCFE_{2030} \times (1 + g) = \$1,550 \times (1 + 0.02) = \$1,581 \text{ million}$$
*   **Terminal Value at the end of 2030 (using Gordon Growth Model):**
    $$TV_{2030} = FCFE_{2031} / (WACC - g) = \$1,581 / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$1,581 / 0.08 = \$19,763 \text{ million}$$
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (Discounted back to today):**
    $$NPV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$19,763 \times 0.564 = \mathbf{\$11,155 \text{ million}}$$

#### **IV. Fair Value Calculation**

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):**
    $$\text{TEV} = \text{NPV}(\text{FCFE}_{2025-2030}) + \text{NPV}(\text{Terminal Value}) + \text{Cash}_{2024} - \text{Debt}_{2024}$$
    *Note: The traditional DCF adds Cash and subtracts Debt from the Total Equity Value, not TEV, but since FCFE represents cash available to equity holders, the direct sum of the NPVs gives the Equity Value. We will use the formula for Equity Value directly to ensure the Debt is correctly subtracted and Cash is correctly added.*

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :---: |
| NPV of Projected FCFE (2025-2030) | $4,648 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $11,155 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$15,803** |
| Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (Current) | $340.4 |
| Less: Total Debt (Current) | $(3,420.0)$ |
| **Net Equity Value** | **$12,723.4** |

*   **Fair Value Per Share:**
    $$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \text{Net Equity Value} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$
    $$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \$12,723.4 \text{ million} / 240.622 \text{ million shares} = \mathbf{\$52.88 \text{ per share}}$$

### **V. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share (MTCH): $\mathbf{\$52.88}$**

**Current Market Price (MTCH): $\mathbf{\$32.62}$**

The calculated fair value of **\$52.88** is significantly higher ($\sim$62\% premium) than the current market price of **\$32.62**.

#### **Justification for the Discrepancy (Market's Assumptions vs. Model's Assumptions)**

The market's current valuation implies a more pessimistic view of Match Group's future growth and profitability than the conservative assumptions used in this model. The key differences are likely due to the market placing a higher discount on two core components:

1.  **Skepticism on the Tinder Turnaround and Hinge's Scalability:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** Tinder's Payer decline stabilizes, and RPP growth sustains a **1.0% Y/Y revenue growth**. Hinge's "rocket ship" growth successfully scales to a **$1 billion+ business** by 2028, driving portfolio-level growth.
    *   **Market View:** The market is likely concerned that the *secular decline* in Tinder's core Payer base is not easily reversible and may continue to accelerate due to competition and platform maturity. Furthermore, the market may doubt Hinge's ability to maintain high growth and profitability as it expands beyond its core English-speaking markets, or that it will be able to fully compensate for a stagnant/declining Tinder. The market may assume **Tinder will continue to decline at 2-3% Y/Y**, and **Hinge's growth will decelerate faster** than projected.

2.  **Conservative Profitability and Cash Flow Risk:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** The Net Income Margin steadily improves from **18.0% to 25.0%** by 2030, driven by operating leverage and management's guided AOI expansion to 39%.
    *   **Market View:** The market may be assuming that the aggressive marketing spend required to fuel Hinge's expansion (a key use of cash) and the continuous product development/R&D required to stabilize Tinder and combat competition will keep margins compressed. Specifically, the market may be projecting a lower terminal margin, or that the current high SBC (which depresses GAAP Net Income) is a structural, non-improving cost.

3.  **High Discount Rate/Low Terminal Growth (Risk Premium):**
    *   **Model Assumption:** $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ WACC and $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ Terminal Growth.
    *   **Market View:** Due to platform risk, evolving regulatory environments (e.g., App Store fee litigation), and the inherent volatility of a consumer-facing, trend-driven business, the market may be applying a higher WACC, potentially **12% or more**. This higher discount rate would significantly depress the NPV of the large terminal value, bringing the fair value closer to the current stock price.

**Conclusion:** Our intrinsic valuation of **\$52.88** suggests that the stock is **undervalued** based on the company's own growth trajectory and stated goals. The market is pricing MTCH as a company with significant execution risk, particularly regarding the successful simultaneous stabilization of its flagship app (Tinder) and the sustained rapid growth of its next-generation platform (Hinge) into a major cash flow engine. An investor agreeing with the management's long-term plan and execution capabilities should view the stock as a strong buy opportunity at the current price.
