### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025–2030)**

The core revenue engine for Match Group is driven by **Payers** and **Revenue Per Payer (RPP)**, predominantly from Tinder and Hinge.

**Management Commentary & Strategy:**
*   The company is undergoing a multi-year "transformation".
*   **Tinder** (the largest brand) is facing **near-term revenue headwinds** and a decline in payers, with management prioritizing product quality and user outcomes (especially Gen Z and women) over immediate revenue, leading to an expectation of flat or declining direct revenue in 2026. They are investing heavily in a product turnaround, including a $50 million increase in the 2026 marketing budget.
*   **Hinge** is the **key growth engine**, with strong user growth, significant international expansion (Europe, Latin America, India), and robust revenue and payer growth (Q4 2025 Direct Revenue up 26%, Payers up 17%).
*   **Overall Guidance:** The official guidance for full-year 2026 total revenue is generally **flat** compared to 2025. The "Resurgence" phase is expected to take hold in **2026 and 2027**.

**Conservative Revenue Assumptions:**

Given the management's explicit warning of near-term headwinds at Tinder and flat revenue guidance for 2026, the projections must be highly conservative, acknowledging that Hinge's high growth will only partially offset the challenges at Tinder. I assume a gradual, delayed re-acceleration that peaks at a modest 6% before reverting to a conservative long-term growth rate.

| Year | Revenue (R) (in thousands USD) | Y/Y Growth % | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $3,479,373 | 3.4% | Historical Revenue. |
| **2025 (Estimated)** | $3,500,000 | 0.6% | Aligning with the cited 2025 full-year revenue of $3.5 billion and flat growth to 2024. |
| **2026** | $3,570,000 | 2.0% | Conservative growth, slightly above management's "flat" guidance, assuming Hinge's strength provides a slight offset to Tinder's decline. |
| **2027** | $3,784,200 | 6.0% | Assumes the "Resurgence" (new Tinder product, Hinge global expansion) begins to take hold aggressively in the latter half of the year. |
| **2028** | $3,973,410 | 5.0% | Slowing from the 2027 peak, reflecting a maturing market and competitive landscape. |
| **2029** | $4,132,346 | 4.0% | Further deceleration toward a mature-company growth rate. |
| **2030** | $4,256,316 | 3.0% | Final projected growth rate. |

### **3. Margin and Net Income Projections**

**Conservative Margin Assumptions:**

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin %** | **70.0%** | Conservative to the 2024 actual of 71.5%. The core software product has excellent gross margins, which should be stable. |
| **Net Income Margin (NIM) %** | **16.0% (2025), 18.0% (2026), 20.0% (2027–2030)** | Gradual improvement from the 2024 actual of 15.8%. Management is focused on "tightly managing costs" and achieving strong Adjusted EBITDA margins (42% in Q4 2025). The 20.0% is a conservative long-term target, reflecting improved operating leverage while still absorbing significant interest and D&A expenses. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | **5.0%** | A conservative, stable return on the cash generated, used to model "additional income" from reinvestment. This is a low-single-digit return for a profitable, growing company. |

**Net Income (Cash Flow Proxy) Calculation:**

Net Income (NI) for year $t$ is calculated as:
$NI_t = (R_t \times NIM_t) + (NI_{t-1} \times ROIC)$

| Year | Revenue (R) (in thousands) | NIM % | NI from Operations (R x NIM) (in thousands) | NI from Prior Year ROIC (NI_t-1 x 5.0%) (in thousands) | **Total Net Income (NI)** (in thousands) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $3,479,373 | 15.8% | N/A | N/A | $551,276 |
| **2025** | $3,500,000 | 16.0% | $560,000 | $27,564 | **$587,564** |
| **2026** | $3,570,000 | 18.0% | $642,600 | $29,378 | **$671,978** |
| **2027** | $3,784,200 | 20.0% | $756,840 | $33,599 | **$790,439** |
| **2028** | $3,973,410 | 20.0% | $794,682 | $39,522 | **$834,204** |
| **2029** | $4,132,346 | 20.0% | $826,469 | $41,710 | **$868,179** |
| **2030** | $4,256,316 | 20.0% | $851,263 | $43,409 | **$894,672** |

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

**DCF Assumptions:**

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **10.0%** | A reasonable rate reflecting the risk profile of a mature, but currently challenged, technology company undergoing a multi-year turnaround. |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative, long-term growth rate proxy, slightly below long-term nominal GDP. |

#### **A. Net Present Value (NPV) of Explicit Forecast Period (2025-2030)**

The present value (PV) is calculated as $NI_t / (1 + WACC)^t$.

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (in thousands) | Discount Factor (1/1.10^t) | **Net Present Value (in thousands)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | $587,564 | 0.9091 | $534,149 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | $671,978 | 0.8264 | $555,302 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | $790,439 | 0.7513 | $593,892 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | $834,204 | 0.6830 | $569,728 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | $868,179 | 0.6209 | $539,080 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | $894,672 | 0.5645 | $504,800 |
| **NPV of Explicit Forecast Period (NPV_F)** | | | **$3,296,951** |

#### **B. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value is the present value of all cash flows beyond 2030. It is calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Model on the 2030 Net Income (NI) and then discounted back to the present (Year 0).

$TV_{2030} = \frac{NI_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{WACC - g} = \frac{\$894,672 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02}$

$TV_{2030} = \frac{\$912,565}{0.08} = \$11,407,063$ thousand

$NPV_{TV} = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{t=6} = \$11,407,063 \times 0.5645$

$NPV_{TV} = \$6,440,929$ thousand

#### **C. Total Net Present Value (Total NPV)**

$\text{Total NPV} = NPV_F + NPV_{TV} = \$3,296,951 + \$6,440,929 = \$9,737,880$ thousand

---

### **5. Fair Value Calculation**

The fair value of the stock is calculated by adjusting the Total NPV (Enterprise Value proxy) for the current net cash position and dividing by the shares outstanding.

$\text{Equity Value} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$

$\text{Equity Value} = \$9,737,880 + \$970,727 - \$4,000,000$

$\text{Equity Value} = \$6,708,607$ thousand

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$6,708,607,000}{240,510,000 \text{ shares}}$

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$27.89$

### **6. Conclusion and Justification**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$27.89** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$32.91** |
| **Difference** | **-15.39%** |

The calculated Fair Value per Share of **$27.89** is approximately **15.39% lower** than the Current Market Price of **$32.91**.

#### **Justification for the Difference**

The difference suggests that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future performance than the conservative DCF model.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions (More Optimistic than Model):**

1.  **Faster Tinder Turnaround:** The market is likely pricing in a quicker and more effective product turnaround at Tinder than the model's conservative 2-6% revenue growth. The market may believe the *Resurgence* will deliver high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth in 2026-2027, driven by new monetization features (like in-app currencies or premium tiers) and the $50M marketing investment.
2.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** The market may be using a higher Perpetual Growth Rate (g) than the model's 2.0% (e.g., 3.0% or 3.5%). A slight increase in 'g' has a massive impact on the Terminal Value. For example, using $g = 3.0\%$ increases the Terminal Value to **$7.1$ billion**, raising the Fair Value per Share to **$30.82**.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may perceive Match Group's underlying core business (dating category dominance) as less risky than the 10.0% WACC used. A lower perceived risk (e.g., WACC of 9.0%) would significantly boost the valuation.

**Model's Conservative Assumptions (Driving the Lower Value):**

1.  **Aggressive Near-Term Conservatism:** The decision to only project 0.6% and 2.0% revenue growth for 2025 and 2026, respectively, despite Hinge's explosive growth and the *potential* of the Tinder turnaround, severely limits the cash flow in the high-impact early years. This is directly based on management's own "flat" revenue guidance for 2026 and focus on long-term transformation over short-term revenue.
2.  **Conservative Peak Growth:** The model's peak annual growth rate is only 6.0% (in 2027), which is modest for a company of Match Group's profile once the turnaround is successful.
3.  **Conservative Long-Term Margin:** The 20.0% Net Income Margin is conservative, given the company's high gross margin and focus on cost discipline. If the company achieves better operating leverage, this margin would be higher.

The model's lower Fair Value is justified by its commitment to conservatively interpreting management's guidance—specifically, the explicit trade-off of near-term revenue for a long-term product fix. This model assumes the turnaround will be slow and measured, while the market appears to be assuming a successful and rapid execution of the "Resurgence" plan.
