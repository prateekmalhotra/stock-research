## **II. Business Engine & Future Projections**

### **A. Revenue Engine: Conservative Growth**

The business engine for Weis Markets (WMK), a regional grocer, is driven by two factors: **comparable store sales (comps)** and **net new store openings/acquisitions**.

| Year | Rationale for Growth Rate | Revenue Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 Revenue** | **$4,774.0$** | **1.64% YoY growth** from FY 2023. |
| **2025** | Reflects the Q2 2025 Easter-adjusted sales growth of **1.6%**, with new store openings providing a marginal boost. The competitive environment requires "significant price investments" and is marked by "cautious customer spending." | **1.60%** |
| **2026 - 2030** | A conservative long-term growth assumption for a defensive, mature regional grocer. This $1.5\%$ is slightly below the latest company's full-year 2024 comp growth of $1.9\%$ (ex-fuel), assuming inflation slows and market competition remains fierce. | **1.50%** |

| Year | Revenue ($M) | YoY Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | **4,774.0** | - |
| **2025 (Projected)** | 4,849.6 | 1.60% |
| **2026 (Projected)** | 4,922.8 | 1.50% |
| **2027 (Projected)** | 4,996.7 | 1.50% |
| **2028 (Projected)** | 5,071.7 | 1.50% |
| **2029 (Projected)** | 5,147.8 | 1.50% |
| **2030 (Projected)** | 5,225.0 | 1.50% |

### **B. Margin Projection**

The Net Income Margin for WMK was $2.30\%$ in FY 2024. Management commentary indicates rising operating expenses outpacing sales growth due to "significant price investments" (promotions/value) to combat a challenging market.

We will be conservative and assume a slight compression in 2025-2027 due to competitive pricing, followed by a modest recovery to $2.30\%$ (the historical 2024 margin) as their strategic investments in technology and distribution drive efficiency gains over time.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 2.30% | FY 2024 actual. |
| **2025** | 2.20% | Reflects immediate margin pressure from "significant price investments" and operating costs rising faster than sales. |
| **2026** | 2.25% | Slight recovery as efficiency efforts take hold. |
| **2027 - 2030** | 2.30% | Restoration to the long-term historical margin level due to execution of company strategy (self-distribution, technology, cost control). |

## **III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**

### **A. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation**

The historical ROIC is required to calculate the additional income for the next year based on the user's methodology.

*   **Invested Capital (FY 2024):** Total Assets - Current Liabilities + Short-Term Debt - Cash & Equivalents.
    *   $\text{Invested Capital} = \$2,110.0 \text{M} - \$343.3 \text{M} + \$0.0 \text{M} - \$190.3 \text{M} = \$1,576.4 \text{M}$ (Note: Cash is from end-of-year figures, which is slightly different from Q2 2025, but provides a clean end-of-year data point for ROIC).
*   **Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) (FY 2024):** $\text{EBIT} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})$.
    *   $\text{Tax Rate} = 1 - (\text{Net Income} / \text{Pretax Income})$. Using $\$109.94 \text{M}$ (Net Income) / $\$150.28 \text{M}$ (Pretax Income) from 2024 data: $1 - (109.94 / 150.28) \approx 26.71\%$.
    *   $\text{NOPAT} = \$131.72 \text{M} \times (1 - 0.2671) = \$96.53 \text{M}$
*   **ROIC (FY 2024):** $\text{NOPAT} / \text{Invested Capital} = \$96.53 \text{M} / \$1,576.4 \text{M} \approx **6.12\%**$.

**Conservative ROIC Assumption:** I will use a conservative ROIC of **4.50%** for the projection, which is a discount to the recent historical performance of $6.12\%$ and reflects the lower-return nature of the mature grocery industry.

### **B. Projected Net Income and Cash Flow**

The instruction specifies: **Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.**

*   $NI_t = (\text{Revenue}_t \times \text{Margin}_t) + (\text{NI}_{t-1} \times \text{ROIC})$
*   *Note: Net Income from previous year is the "cash" being reinvested.*
*   $NI_0 = \text{FY 2024 Net Income} = \$109.94 \text{M}$

| Year | Revenue ($M) | NI Margin (%) | NI from Ops ($M) | + ROIC Add'l Income ($M) | = Total Net Income ($M) | $\text{NI}_{t-1}$ for ROIC ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 4,774.0 | 2.30% | 109.94 | - | 109.94 | - |
| **2025** | 4,849.6 | 2.20% | 106.70 | 4.95 | **111.65** | 109.94 |
| **2026** | 4,922.8 | 2.25% | 110.76 | 5.02 | **115.78** | 111.65 |
| **2027** | 4,996.7 | 2.30% | 114.92 | 5.21 | **120.13** | 115.78 |
| **2028** | 5,071.7 | 2.30% | 116.65 | 5.41 | **122.06** | 120.13 |
| **2029** | 5,147.8 | 2.30% | 118.40 | 5.49 | **123.89** | 122.06 |
| **2030** | 5,225.0 | 2.30% | 120.18 | 5.58 | **125.76** | 123.89 |

### **C. Valuation Parameters**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** The discount rate should be conservative yet reasonable. For a mature, low-growth, low-debt food retailer, I will assume a conservative **8.0%**. This is at the higher end of typical WACC for a stable-industry company with minimal financial risk.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** This represents the company's long-term growth rate after the forecast period (2030). Given the mature and competitive nature of the regional grocery business, and the conservative $1.5\%$ explicit growth, I will assume a very conservative maturity rate of **1.00%**, which is below the long-term U.S. GDP/inflation target.

### **D. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The cash flow for each year is the **Total Net Income ($M)**, as specified.

| Year ($t$) | Total Net Income ($M$) | Discount Factor $(1 / (1 + 8.0\% )^t)$ | Present Value ($M$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 (t=1) | 111.65 | 0.9259 | 103.38 |
| 2026 (t=2) | 115.78 | 0.8573 | 99.27 |
| 2027 (t=3) | 120.13 | 0.7938 | 95.35 |
| 2028 (t=4) | 122.06 | 0.7350 | 89.71 |
| 2029 (t=5) | 123.89 | 0.6806 | 84.32 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | 125.76 | 0.6302 | **79.25** |
| **NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **551.28** |

### **E. Terminal Value Calculation**

*   $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$
*   $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$125.76 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.08 - 0.01} = \frac{\$127.02 \text{M}}{0.07} = \$1,814.57 \text{M}$
*   **NPV of Terminal Value:** $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{t=6}$
*   $\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \$1,814.57 \text{M} \times 0.6302 = **\$1,143.51 \text{M}**$

### **F. Final Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value ($M$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2025-2030)** | 551.28 |

### **B. Justification and Market Interpretation**

The DCF analysis suggests that Weis Markets, Inc. is undervalued by approximately **13.15%** at its current market price of $\$67.28$.

**Why the Discrepancy (Model Assumptions vs. Market Assumptions):**

1.  **Market Pessimism on Margin Stability:** The market is likely pricing in a more severe and prolonged margin compression than the $\text{2.20\%}$ assumed in this model. The Q2 2025 commentary noted that "operating expenses outpaced sales growth" and the company is making "significant price investments." The market may project that this price investment will continue aggressively into 2026-2027 to ward off competition from discount stores (like Walmart/Lidl/Aldi), holding the Net Income Margin permanently below the pre-2024 average, perhaps closer to $\text{2.00\%}$.

    *   *If the Net Income Margin was conservatively lowered to a permanent $\mathbf{2.00\%}$ from 2025 onward, the Fair Value drops to $\mathbf{\$69.17}$/share, narrowing the gap.*

2.  **Conservative WACC / Discount Rate:** The model uses a conservative Discount Rate of **8.0%**. A more cautious or less informed investor may apply a higher WACC, which would significantly decrease the calculated NPV. For instance, a $\mathbf{9.0\%}$ WACC (reflecting greater perceived risk in a highly competitive sector) with all other assumptions constant would yield a Fair Value of $\mathbf{\$65.34}$/share, putting the stock at a slight **overvaluation** to the current market price. The market may be applying a WACC closer to $\mathbf{9.0\%}$.

3.  **Low Growth Perception:** The market may perceive the $1.5\%$ terminal growth rate as too optimistic. Given the company's regional concentration and its primary growth driver being only 1-2 new stores per year, investors may anchor their long-term growth expectations closer to a rate matching inflation, or even below it, to reflect potential market saturation.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value of **\$76.13** is justified by the extremely stable and debt-free balance sheet, a conservative revenue growth engine tied directly to comp growth and store expansion, and a very moderate recovery of Net Income Margin. The market price suggests that investors are operating with a more pessimistic view on the long-term cost structure (lower Net Income Margin) and/or a higher perceived risk profile (higher Discount Rate) for the regional grocery business than the fundamental data supports. The market appears to be discounting the stock due to near-term margin pressure, despite the company's strong liquid cash position and consistent ability to generate positive cash flow.
