## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The company's business engine is defined by two primary forces: structural weakness in core office/consumer categories due to "softer global demand" and "continued weakness in Brazil" [cite: 11, from previous step], which is being aggressively countered by a multi-year cost reduction program and growth in "faster growing categories" like Technology Accessories (Kensington) and Gaming Accessories (PowerA).

**Engine Assumptions:**
*   **Cost Savings as an Off-Set:** The \$100M cumulative annualized cost savings program by the end of 2026 primarily serves to stabilize margins against volume/demand decline in core categories.
*   **Base Decline:** The structural decline in core office/consumer products is assumed to continue, but will be partially offset by pricing actions and a return to growth in the Technology/Gaming segment in 2026 and beyond.
*   **The Projections are Conservative:** Given the sustained negative volume trend and general macroeconomic uncertainty affecting consumer and business spending, the model assumes only a modest revenue recovery after the initial 2025 dip.

| Year | Revenue Rationale | Revenue Projection (Millions) | Y-o-Y Growth % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | Baseline | \$1,670.0 | -9.1% |
| **2025** | Management Guidance Midpoint (7.75% decline) | \$1,540.3 | -7.75% |
| **2026** | Stable base. Core categories stabilize. Cost program is fully implemented, allowing a small price-driven revenue increase (1.0%). | \$1,555.7 | 1.0% |
| **2027** | Conservative growth. Tech/Gaming growth begins to slightly outweigh core decline (1.5%). | \$1,579.0 | 1.5% |
| **2028** | Modest structural growth (2.0%). | \$1,610.6 | 2.0% |
| **2029** | Modest structural growth (2.0%). | \$1,642.8 | 2.0% |
| **2030** | Modest structural growth (2.0%). | \$1,675.7 | 2.0% |

## 3. Margin Projections and Net Income

The key driver for margin expansion is the multi-year cost reduction program.

**Margin Assumptions:**
*   **Net Income Margin (2025 Base):** I will use the 2025 Adjusted Net Income (Implied \$78.0M) as the base for profitability, as it reflects management's operating expectation and excludes non-cash impairments. This gives a 2025 Net Income Margin of **5.06%** (\$78.0M / \$1,540.3M).
*   **Margin Expansion:** The model will assume a 10 basis point (0.10%) annual improvement in the Net Income Margin for 2026-2030, reflecting the full realization of the \$100M cost savings (by the end of 2026) and better cost leverage on the modest growth.
*   **Tax Rate:** A stable 30% adjusted tax rate is used, as guided by management [cite: 11, from previous step].
*   **ROIC Assumption:** Past GAAP performance has been volatile due to impairments (net loss in 2023). Following the rule, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive **ROIC of 5.0%**, applied to the accumulated prior-year's Net Income (cash on balance sheet).

| Year | Net Income Margin % | Net Income (Projected) | ROIC on Prior Year NI (5.0%) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 5.06% | \$78.0M | N/A | \$78.0M |
| **2026** | 5.16% (5.06% + 0.10%) | \$80.3M | (\$78.0M \* 5.0%) = \$3.9M | \$84.2M |
| **2027** | 5.26% (5.16% + 0.10%) | \$83.0M | ((\$78.0M + \$84.2M) \* 5.0%) = \$8.1M | \$91.1M |
| **2028** | 5.36% (5.26% + 0.10%) | \$86.4M | ((\$78.0M + \$84.2M + \$91.1M) \* 5.0%) = \$12.7M | \$99.1M |
| **2029** | 5.46% (5.36% + 0.10%) | \$89.8M | ((\$78.0M + \$84.2M + \$91.1M + \$99.1M) \* 5.0%) = \$17.6M | \$107.4M |
| **2030** | 5.56% (5.46% + 0.10%) | \$93.0M | ((\$78.0M + \$84.2M + \$91.1M + \$99.1M + \$107.4M) \* 5.0%) = \$23.0M | \$116.0M |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Assumption | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **10.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate given the company's high debt load (\$877.8M), the nature of its lower-growth industry, and the current uncertain global macroeconomic environment. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (Maturity)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative rate, in line with or slightly below long-term inflation and global GDP growth, which assumes the business will stabilize and grow at a moderate, sustainable rate post-2030. |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (PV) of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$78.0M | 0.9091 | \$70.91M |
| **2026** | \$84.2M | 0.8264 | \$69.67M |
| **2027** | \$91.1M | 0.7513 | \$68.44M |
| **2028** | \$99.1M | 0.6830 | \$67.70M |
| **2029** | \$107.4M | 0.6209 | \$66.90M |
| **2030 (Terminal Year)** | \$116.0M | 0.5645 | \$65.43M |
| **Total PV of Explicit Period** | | | **\$409.05M** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   **Cash Flow (2031 Estimate):** \$116.0M \* (1 + 0.02) = \$118.32M
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** (Cash Flow (2031)) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** \$118.32M / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$1,479.0M
*   **PV of Terminal Value (2030):** Terminal Value (2030) \* Discount Factor (2030)
*   **PV of Terminal Value (2030):** \$1,479.0M \* 0.5645 = **\$834.80M**

*   **Total Enterprise Value (NPV):** PV of Explicit Period + PV of Terminal Value
*   **Total Enterprise Value (NPV):** \$409.05M + \$834.80M = **\$1,243.85M**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Per Share

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (NPV)** | \$1,243.85M |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$877.80M |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | +\$82.50M |
| **Fair Equity Value** | **\$448.55M** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 90.14 Million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$4.98** |

### **Fair Value Per Share: \$4.98**

### Market Price vs. Fair Value Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$4.98** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$3.91** |
| **Difference (Undervaluation)** | **\$1.07 (27.4%)** |

### Justification and Market Assumptions

The calculated Fair Value of **\$4.98** is 27.4% higher than the current market price of **\$3.91**, suggesting the stock is undervalued based on these conservative assumptions.

**Why the Market is Different (The Market's Assumptions):**

The market is likely applying a higher degree of skepticism to the company's turnaround and future profitability, which translates to a lower valuation. The market is likely making one or more of the following assumptions:

1.  **Lower Terminal Growth/Higher Risk (Discount Rate):** The market may believe the long-term structural decline in core office and paper-based products is permanent and will overwhelm the growth in the Technology/Gaming segment. This would lead the market to use a lower Terminal Growth Rate (e.g., 1.0% or 0%) or a significantly higher Discount Rate (WACC > 10.0%), penalizing the value of the long-term cash flows.
2.  **Failure to Realize Cost Savings:** The market may not fully believe that the **\$100M in annualized cost savings** will fully drop to the bottom line, or that new operating costs (like dealing with new tariffs) will completely negate the cost program benefits. This would lead to projected Net Income margins being lower than my projected 5.1% to 5.6% range.
3.  **High Debt Risk:** With over **\$877M in debt** and an amended credit agreement leverage ratio of 4.14x, the company is highly leveraged. Although the company has no debt maturities until 2029, the market may be pricing in a higher risk of financial distress or a mandatory equity raise/dividend cut, which dampens investor enthusiasm and keeps the price depressed.

**The Case for the Calculated Fair Value:**

My calculated fair value is justified because it is explicitly built on conservative adherence to management's own key guidance metrics:

1.  **Credibility of Adjusted Earnings:** The valuation uses the implied 2025 Adjusted Net Income of **\$78.0M**, which is directly derived from management's **Adjusted EPS guidance of \$0.83 to \$0.90**. This assumes the company will, at a minimum, meet its publicly guided operating profitability.
2.  **Conservative Margins and ROIC:** The model assumes only a **10 basis point annual margin increase** and a conservative **5.0% ROIC** on retained earnings, which is a very modest assumption given the guidance of **\$100M in cost savings by 2026**.
3.  **Conservative DCF Inputs:** The **10.0% Discount Rate** and **2.0% Terminal Growth Rate** are conservative inputs that reflect high-risk, low-growth characteristics.

In essence, the market is pricing in a significant risk of ACCO *failing to execute* on its stated turnaround and cost-saving strategy, while this valuation assumes a **conservative execution** of that strategy. If ACCO successfully hits its \$100M cost target and stabilizes revenue after 2025, the stock should move toward the \$4.98 valuation.
