## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

ACCO is a global supplier of branded academic, consumer, and business products (office supplies and technology accessories). The business engine is highly reliant on global consumer and business spending, the "back-to-school" season, and the evolving hybrid work model, which acts as a major headwind.

The long-term strategy, as highlighted in earnings calls, centers on:
1.  **Cost Reduction:** A **$100 million multi-year cost-reduction program** is currently in progress, with approximately $50 million in cumulative savings realized as of Q3 2025. This drives future margin expansion.
2.  **Long-Term Growth:** Management is confident in a long-term return to growth driven by new product launches and the expected stabilizing or slight recovery of demand from a "return-to-office trend".

### A. Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

| Year | Rationale (Conservative) | Projected Revenue (Millions USD) | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | Management guidance calls for a reported sales decline of 7.0% to 8.5%. We use the most conservative number: **8.5% decline** from FY2024 revenue ($1,700.0M). | $1,555.5 | -8.5% |
| **2026** | Projected recovery year. Leveraging the ongoing $100M cost reduction and initial benefits of the assumed **return-to-office trend**. A very modest positive growth of **1.0%** is assumed, reflecting a cautious rebound in a mature industry. | $1,571.1 | 1.0% |
| **2027** | As a mature business, organic growth is difficult. Assuming continued low, but positive, momentum from cost savings and a stable market. **0.5% growth**. | $1,578.9 | 0.5% |
| **2028** | Stable, mature industry growth rate. **0.5% growth**. | $1,586.8 | 0.5% |
| **2029** | Stable, mature industry growth rate. **0.5% growth**. | $1,594.7 | 0.5% |
| **2030** | Stable, mature industry growth rate. **0.5% growth**. | $1,602.7 | 0.5% |

### B. Margin Projections and Net Income

The primary driver of profitability is the multi-year **$100 million cost-reduction program**. Net Income Margin is currently negative (FY 2024: -6.0%). Management's adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 implies profitability. We will model the improvement conservatively:

*   **Gross Margin:** FY 2024 was 33.3%. Q3 2025 saw a 50 bps improvement to 33.0%. We assume the $100M program will ultimately expand the Gross Margin by **1.0%** and the Net Margin by **2.0%** as cost savings also hit SG&A.
*   **Net Income Margin Target:** We model a gradual improvement to a long-term conservative Net Income Margin of **2.0%** by 2030. This is conservative given the FY 2024 negative margin, but assumes the company successfully executes its cost-reduction plan to restore modest profitability.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) | Reinvested Cash (C) | Additional Income (D) | Total Net Income (B+D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $1,700.0 | -6.0% | -$101.6 | - | - | - |
| **2025** | $1,555.5 | 0.5% | $7.8 | $7.8 | $0.0 | $7.8 |
| **2026** | $1,571.1 | 1.0% | $15.7 | $15.7 | $0.4 | $16.1 |
| **2027** | $1,578.9 | 1.5% | $23.7 | $23.7 | $0.8 | $24.5 |
| **2028** | $1,586.8 | 1.8% | $28.6 | $28.6 | $1.2 | $29.8 |
| **2029** | $1,594.7 | 1.9% | $30.3 | $30.3 | $1.4 | $31.7 |
| **2030** | $1,602.7 | 2.0% | $32.1 | - | $1.5 | $33.6 |

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

### A. Cash Flow and ROIC Assumption

The rules state:
*   Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.
*   Additional Income = ROIC \* Net Income from the previous year.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** We use a conservative **5.0%** ROIC. This is below the TTM ROCE of 7.0%, reflecting caution about the company's ability to generate high returns in a low-growth industry.

*   *Initial Cash for 2026 = 2025 Net Income ($7.8M) *
*   *Additional Income 2027 = ROIC (5.0%) \* 2026 Cash ($16.1M)*
*   *Cash for 2027 = Initial Cash 2027 + Additional Income 2027 = $16.1M + $0.8M = $16.9M*

### B. Valuation Parameters

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**. This rate is high for a stable, mature company, but appropriately conservative given the negative net income history, high debt, and industry headwinds.
*   **Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate (Very Conservative):** **1.0%**. This is below the projected 2026-2030 growth rate and reflects a very conservative assumption of long-term growth (below GDP and inflation) for a mature office products company.

### C. Discounted Cash Flow Calculation

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (Ni) | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value of Ni (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $7.8 | 0.909 | $7.1 |
| **2026** | $16.1 | 0.826 | $13.3 |
| **2027** | $24.5 | 0.751 | $18.4 |
| **2028** | $29.8 | 0.683 | $20.3 |
| **2029** | $31.7 | 0.621 | $19.7 |
| **2030** | $33.6 | 0.564 | $18.9 |
| **Sum of PVs (2025-2030)** | | | **$97.7** |

### D. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The terminal value estimates the value of the company's cash flows beyond the 2030 projection period.

*   **TV Formula:** [Cash Flow at Maturity * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   **TV Calculation:** [$33.6 * (1 + 0.01)] / (0.10 - 0.01) = $33.9 / 0.09 = **$376.7 million**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value (PV TV):** TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(t)
*   **PV TV:** $376.7 / (1 + 0.10)^6 = $376.7 / 1.772 = **$212.6 million**

### E. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | $97.7 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | $212.6 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$310.3** |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents** | $82.5 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $873.5 |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **-$480.7** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 95.8 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **-$5.02** |

## 4. Conclusion and Justification

### A. Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **-$5.02** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **~$4.08** |

### B. Justification of Discrepancy

My calculated fair value is **negative $5.02** per share, which is a massive discrepancy from the current market price of **~$4.08** per share. The result indicates that, based on a conservative DCF model using current financial information and management's own guidance, the company's debt load is far too high for the projected free cash flow generation.

**The primary reasons for the negative valuation are:**

1.  **High Debt Load:** The Total Debt of **$873.5 million** completely overwhelms the Total Enterprise Value ($310.3 million) derived from future cash flows. The net cash position (Cash - Debt) is -$791.0 million, which, divided by the 95.8 million shares, translates to an initial liability of over -$8.25 per share. The market is not valuing the company's future cash flows highly enough to cover this debt.
2.  **Conservative Projections:**
    *   **Low Growth Rate:** The post-2026 growth rate of **0.5%** for a company in a struggling industry (office products due to hybrid work) is deliberately conservative but accurately reflects the maturity and structural headwinds of the business. The market may be assuming a more aggressive recovery and/or successful acquisitions driving higher growth.
    *   **Low Margin Target:** The 2.0% Net Income Margin target by 2030, while representing a strong turnaround from the 2024 loss, is low. The market may be pricing in the full success of the $100 million cost-reduction program leading to a Net Income Margin closer to the company's historical higher levels or a higher Adjusted EBITDA/Free Cash Flow multiple, which does not account for the high interest expense as effectively as Net Income does.
3.  **Market's Assumptions (Why the stock is ~$4.08):** The market is likely valuing ACCO on one or more of the following:
    *   **Adjusted EBITDA/Free Cash Flow (FCF) Multiples:** ACCO guides for Adjusted FCF of $90M-$100M in 2025. FCF is often used for highly levered companies. At $95M FCF, the stock trades at an EV/FCF of roughly $310.3M / $95M = **3.27x**, which is extremely low, suggesting the market is anticipating a steep FCF decline, but is not fully discounting the debt liability.
    *   **Successful Deleveraging:** The market is likely giving the company credit for its stated priority to use FCF to pay down debt (e.g., $100M paid in Q3 2025), which would rapidly improve the balance sheet and increase the **Fair Value of Equity** over time.
    *   **Reorganization/Liquidation Value:** The market price may represent the perceived value of the company's strong brands (Kensington, Swingline, Five Star) and tangible assets, which the DCF model does not explicitly capture.

My valuation's core conclusion is that **ACCO Brands is currently fundamentally over-leveraged for its projected long-term cash generation based on conservative revenue and margin assumptions.** The stock price is supported by the expectation of an aggressive, successful, and debt-focused operational turnaround and/or a valuation based on a more forgiving metric like FCF or a lower discount rate.
