## Business Summary

MBIA Inc. operates primarily as a financial guarantee insurance company, providing assurance that investors will receive scheduled payments on certain debt obligations. The core business involves selling insurance policies, known as guarantees, mainly on municipal bonds issued by U.S. states, cities, and public agencies. When a municipality issues a bond, MBIA guarantees the principal and interest payments; if the issuer defaults, MBIA pays the bondholders. This protection makes the bond safer and helps the municipality borrow money at a lower interest rate. MBIA collects upfront premiums for this service. Its primary customers are large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, who hold these bonds, and the business is focused almost entirely within the United States. Currently, a significant portion of the company's activities involves managing and resolving complex, risky insurance contracts that were issued before the 2008 financial crisis, while also writing new insurance on high-quality public finance debt.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk stems from MBIA's remaining exposure to legacy structured finance products—the highly complex and risky contracts it insured prior to the 2008 crisis. If the underlying assets tied to these old guarantees (like certain mortgage securities) continue to worsen due to an economic slowdown, the company could face large, unexpected claim payments, severely damaging its financial stability. A second near-term threat is a widespread economic recession, which could cause U.S. municipalities to default on their obligations, leading to a surge in claims on its core municipal bond insurance portfolio. Historically, the company nearly failed during the 2008 crisis due to massive losses from these structured products, demonstrating how quickly unexpected defaults can deplete its capital base. The long-term risk relates to market position. The financial guarantee market is small, highly competitive, and slow to grow. If MBIA cannot successfully win enough new, profitable municipal insurance business, the company faces the risk of becoming a pure 'run-off' entity, meaning its business would simply shrink as existing policies expire, making it difficult to maintain relevance and restore investor confidence.

## Company History

MBIA Inc. (Municipal Bond Insurance Association) is a financial services company with a history defined by its success in a quiet corner of finance and its near-collapse during the 2008 financial crisis.

Here is a detailed history lesson on MBIA Inc., explaining its origins, challenges, and current structure in simple terms.

***

### 1. Inception and Original Goal (1973)

1.  **The Founding:** MBIA was founded in 1973 as the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, a consortium of large insurance companies that pooled their resources.
2.  **The Business Goal:** Its original purpose was to provide **financial guarantee insurance** (or bond insurance) primarily for municipal bonds.
3.  **The Value Proposition:** When a city or state issues a bond to fund a public project (like a school or a bridge), MBIA would insure the bond, promising to pay the investors if the municipality defaulted. This insurance gave the bond a top-tier credit rating (usually AAA), allowing the municipality to borrow money at a much lower interest rate, saving taxpayer money.
4.  **Early Growth (Tailwind):** The company went public in 1987 (MBIA Inc.) and grew steadily, establishing a strong reputation in the safe, reliable world of municipal finance, even expanding internationally.

### 2. The Mid-Career Challenges and Headwinds (1990s - 2007)

1.  **First Major Loss:** In 1998, MBIA faced its largest loss to date when the Allegheny health care system filed for bankruptcy, which resulted in civil settlements with regulators like the SEC.
2.  **Expansion into New Markets (Risk-Taking):** Seeking more revenue, MBIA and its competitors, known as "monoline insurers" because they initially only insured bonds, expanded into the complex and riskier world of **structured finance**.
3.  **The Toxic Assets:** They began insuring products like mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were essentially complex packages of mortgages, including many high-risk subprime loans.
4.  **The Canary in the Coal Mine:** As early as 2002, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman publicly challenged MBIA's prized AAA rating, arguing that its growing exposure to the risky structured finance products would eventually lead to its collapse, a prediction that was initially dismissed by the company.

### 3. The Financial Crisis and Near-Collapse (2008 Headwind)

1.  **The Crisis Hits:** When the U.S. housing market collapsed starting in 2007, the toxic mortgage-backed securities that MBIA had insured defaulted in massive numbers.
2.  **The Downgrade Catastrophe:** Because MBIA's entire business model was built on having a rock-solid, AAA credit rating, the wave of expected losses forced credit rating agencies to slash its rating starting in 2008.
3.  **A Crippling Blow:** Losing the AAA rating was devastating because it instantly destroyed the value proposition—a bond insurer with a lower rating could no longer effectively "upgrade" the credit of the bonds it insured.

### 4. The Innovative Solution: The "Transformation" (2009)

1.  **The Split:** In 2009, MBIA executed a controversial "Transformation" strategy to save its core municipal bond business from the collapsing structured finance segment.
2.  **Good Bank/Bad Bank Model:** They legally split the company into two entities:
    *   **National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation (The "Good" Business):** A new, separately capitalized, and legally protected company dedicated *only* to the safe U.S. municipal bond business.
    *   **MBIA Insurance Corporation (The "Bad" Business):** The original entity kept the collapsing structured finance policies and the accompanying claims/losses from the financial crisis.
3.  **Litigation Headwind:** This restructuring was met with years of intense legal battles, as major Wall Street banks sued MBIA, arguing the company improperly moved billions of dollars in capital away from them (as holders of the "bad" policies) to create the new, protected entity.
4.  **The Counter-Offensive:** In its defense, MBIA launched its own massive lawsuits against the banks, arguing that the banks had committed fraud by lying about the quality of the underlying mortgages in the structured securities it was asked to insure.

### 5. Present Day (Post-Crisis Focus)

1.  **Current Business Focus:** MBIA Inc. operates today as a holding company with two main operating segments: U.S. Public Finance and International and Structured Finance Insurance.
2.  **The Core Goal (National):** **National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation** is its forward-looking operation, focusing exclusively on insuring municipal bonds in the U.S. and re-establishing trust in the traditional bond insurance market.
3.  **The Legacy Goal (MBIA Corp.):** The original **MBIA Insurance Corporation** is primarily a "run-off" book of business, meaning its current goal is to manage the inherited claims from the 2008 crisis, actively recover money through its long-running lawsuits against the parties it insured, and slowly wind down that troubled book of business.
4.  **Ongoing Headwinds:** The company continues to deal with major claims, most notably from the default of bonds issued by Puerto Rico; National has been paying out claims and is involved in litigation with the bond underwriters in an attempt to recover those massive losses.

In essence, MBIA started as a stable pillar of municipal finance, nearly destroyed itself by venturing into reckless speculative markets, and survived by aggressively separating the good business from the bad, spending the last decade and a half primarily in courtrooms fighting to manage its legacy obligations and maintain its public-sector insurance business.

## Moat Analysis

MBIA Inc.'s moat must be analyzed with the critical understanding that its primary insurance subsidiaries are currently in "runoff." This means their core business is no longer underwriting new financial guarantees but rather managing their existing, long-term portfolio of insured bonds, making its competitive advantages distinct from a company focused on growth.

### Moat and Competitive Advantages of MBIA Inc.

1.  **Irrevocable, Locked-in Contract Moat (The Portfolio):**
    *   The primary moat is the massive, existing portfolio of municipal and structured finance bonds that MBIA has guaranteed over the years.
    *   These financial guarantee insurance policies are **unconditional and irrevocable** for the life of the bond (which can be 20-30 years), meaning the premiums and obligations are locked in until maturity.
    *   This makes the company’s revenue stream from this portfolio extremely sticky and difficult for any competitor to displace, as the guarantee is already in place and cannot be easily canceled.

2.  **High Barrier to Entry (Regulatory and Capital):**
    *   The financial guarantee industry has extremely high barriers to entry, which is the main reason MBIA grew into a prominent player historically and why new entrants are rare.
    *   Starting a financial guarantee business requires significant minimum regulatory capital (hundreds of millions of dollars) and a deep bench of specialized financial and credit expertise.
    *   Furthermore, a new entrant would need to quickly achieve and maintain the highest possible credit rating (e.g., AAA), which is essential for the insurance to be valuable to bond issuers, a process that takes years of flawless execution.

3.  **Historical Brand and Reputation:**
    *   MBIA, founded in 1973, was one of the original and largest "monoline" insurers, and its name carries significant weight and recognition in the municipal finance market.
    *   Historically, this reputation and strong credit rating were its main competitive edge, allowing municipalities with lower ratings to effectively borrow money at a lower interest rate by putting MBIA's high rating on their bonds.

### Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Market Position

4.  **Differentiation is Now Capital Management, Not Products:**
    *   The key difference between MBIA and its active competitors like Assured Guaranty or Build America Mutual (BAM) is that MBIA is primarily a capital and risk management business in run-off, while its competitors are actively underwriting new policies.
    *   MBIA's current value proposition for shareholders is the successful run-off of the legacy portfolio and the potential release of excess cash (liquidity) from its well-capitalized subsidiary, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation.

5.  **No New Pricing Power or Network Effects:**
    *   Since the main subsidiaries are not writing new business, the company does not have *current* pricing power in the new-issue bond market.
    *   The nature of the financial guarantee business does not typically create classic "network effects" where the value of the product increases with the number of users; rather, it's a reputation-based system where the guarantor's credit rating is the sole "product."

6.  **Customer Contracts Are Sticky, Not Recurring (in the traditional sense):**
    *   Contracts are extremely **sticky** because the guarantee lasts for the full life of the bond (long-term obligation), meaning the premium is locked in until the debt matures.
    *   However, they are **not recurring** in the subscription or repurchase sense, as MBIA is not seeking repeat customers for new policies. The existing customers' bonds are simply running off the books over time.

### Displacement and Innovation

7.  **Displacement is Slow and Difficult:**
    *   A competitor with a large amount of capital **cannot easily displace** MBIA’s in-force contracts because those guarantees are irrevocable legal obligations.
    *   In the *new* market, a well-capitalized competitor **could** easily displace MBIA because MBIA has chosen to step back from underwriting new policies.

8.  **Minimal Investment in R&D or Constant Innovation:**
    *   The financial guarantee business is fundamentally an underwriting and risk management business, not a technology product.
    *   MBIA’s focus is on credit analysis, portfolio surveillance, and legal strategies to mitigate losses on the legacy book, not on typical research and development (R&D) or constant product innovation for new business.
    *   The "innovation" is the internal risk-management and loss-mitigation efforts it performs through its service company.

## Catalyst Analysis

MBIA Inc. (MBI) is largely driven by the resolution of its legacy exposures, particularly its financial guarantee exposure to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) debt.

### Catalysts for Stock Price Increase

#### Near-Term Catalysts (Resolution of Legacy Issues)

1.  **Resolution of PREPA Debt Exposure:** A final, favorable settlement or resolution of the company's financial guarantee exposure to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) is the most significant near-term catalyst. The removal of this uncertainty from the balance sheet could immediately re-rate the stock.
2.  **Strategic Sale of PREPA Claims:** The company is actively exploring the potential sale of certain PREPA claims, which, if executed, would mitigate uncertainty and enhance liquidity.
3.  **Favorable Adjustments to Zohar Recoveries:** Fluctuations in the estimates of recoveries from the Zohar Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) have impacted recent quarterly results. Favorable adjustments to these recovery estimates could boost quarterly earnings and statutory capital for its insurance subsidiary, MBIA Insurance Corp.

#### Long-Term Catalysts (Capital Return and Clean-Up)

1.  **Return of Capital to MBIA Inc.:** Once its insurance subsidiaries, specifically National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, are adequately capitalized and have resolved or significantly reduced their major liabilities (like PREPA), they could pay substantial dividends to the holding company, MBIA Inc. This capital infusion could lead to a significant stock price increase.
2.  **Shrinking Liabilities and Reduced Risk:** The company's long-term strategy involves running off its existing insured portfolio, meaning the total guaranteed debt and associated risk decreases over time. As liabilities are paid down and risk is reduced, the company's book value and financial profile should become cleaner and more attractive to investors.
3.  **Increased Liquidity at the Holding Company:** A sustained reduction in the net loss and an increase in unencumbered cash and liquid assets at the holding company level provides flexibility, which can eventually be used for corporate actions that benefit shareholders.

### Management's Stated Strategy (Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Primary Focus on PREPA:** Chief Executive Officer Bill Fallon has explicitly stated that their **priority continues to be resolving National's PREPA exposure**, acknowledging that the timing of this resolution remains uncertain.
*   **Active Claim Management:** Management has emphasized the importance of **strategic claim management**, including cooperation agreements with partners (like Azure and GoldenTree) and transferring claims to a custodian as part of the strategy to mitigate uncertainty.
*   **Derisking the Portfolio:** The strategy includes a focus on **derisking the insured portfolio** of MBIA Insurance Corp., for example, through the deconsolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).
*   **Confidence in Litigation and Recovery:** Management has expressed **confidence in ongoing litigation efforts** to support their claims and emphasized the positive impact of favorable adjustments to Zohar-related recoveries on statutory capital.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of MBIA Inc.'s (MBI) recent proxy filings (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure is strongly aligned with shareholder interests, suggesting they have a significant incentive to act in the shareholders' best interest.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for MBIA Inc. (MBI)**

#### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors (Higher the Better)**

1.  **High Absolute and Relative Ownership:** The executive officers and directors of MBIA Inc. as a group beneficially own a high number of shares, which represents a strong alignment with shareholder outcomes.
2.  **CEO's Significant Stake:** The Chairman, President, and CEO, William C. Fallon, beneficially owns over 2.6 million shares as of March 12, 2025, representing an approximate ownership stake of over 5% of the company's outstanding common stock.
3.  **Mandatory Stock Ownership Guidelines:** Senior management is subject to strict stock ownership guidelines, which require the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to own stock valued at **7 times** their base salary, and other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) to own stock valued at **3 times** their base salary.
4.  **Compliance with Guidelines:** As of March 12, 2025, the CEO and three of the four other NEOs had already exceeded their mandated ownership levels, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining a substantial personal financial stake in the company's long-term success.

#### **Executive Compensation Structure**

## Price History

MBIA Inc. (MBI) has experienced significant appreciation over the last year and is currently trading near its 52-week high.

### **MBIA Inc. (MBI) Price History Analysis**

1.  **Current Price Context:** The last closing price for MBIA Inc. was \$7.61 (as of September 26, 2025), placing the stock much closer to its 52-week high than its low.
2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **132.01%** above its 52-week low of \$3.28. The 52-week high is \$8.26.
3.  **Technical Analysis — Trading Low?** Based on recent price action, MBI is **not trading low**; it has shown a 110.80% increase over the last year and is near the top of its 52-week range.
4.  **Technical Indicators:** The stock holds a long-term buy signal from its long-term Moving Average, suggesting a positive long-term outlook. However, it also shows a short-term sell signal, and its current price is closer to the near-term resistance level of \$7.80 than the support level of \$7.23.
5.  **Recent Big Rises (Catalyst):** The stock has been up significantly in recent months, with one instance showing a "remarkable strength with a 24% gain in the past week" (as of early August 2025). This positive movement is likely tied to **optimism surrounding MBIA's efforts to resolve its exposure to the Puerto Rican energy sector**, a long-standing financial issue for the company.
6.  **Price Drops and Volatility:** The stock price is highly sensitive to news concerning its Puerto Rico bond holdings, which can cause sudden price drops, such as a **14.5% drop in a single week** due to a conflict involving Puerto Rican bondholders. Furthermore, the company reported adjusted net losses in both the first and second quarters of 2025, though the Q1 loss was an improvement year-over-year.
7.  **Analyst Consensus:** Wall Street analysts currently give MBIA a **"Moderate Buy"** consensus rating, but with an average 12-month price target that is slightly below the current price, suggesting limited expected near-term upside from its current level.

---

## Long Thesis

The bullish argument centers on MBIA successfully completing its strategy of cleaning up its old, troubled insurance policies to unlock substantial trapped cash for shareholders. In the near term, the stock price will rise sharply (a 're-rating') when the company achieves a final, favorable resolution or settlement of its massive financial exposure to the Puerto Rican debt (specifically the PREPA utility bonds). This removes the single biggest source of uncertainty and risk hanging over the company. In the long term, once the major legal liabilities are settled and the company’s remaining risky guarantees expire, the management can release the vast amounts of excess cash currently held inside its healthy, protected municipal bond insurance subsidiary (National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation). This cash will be paid up to the holding company and used primarily for large share buybacks, significantly reducing the number of shares outstanding and causing the value of each remaining share to multiply as the company effectively runs off its business, transforming into a pure capital return story.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several critical assumptions being met successfully:

1.  **Favorable PREPA Resolution:** The company must achieve a final, definitive, and favorable resolution regarding the Puerto Rican PREPA debt exposure that is better than current market expectations and allows for the recovery of a significant portion of claims paid.
2.  **Successful Capital Transfer:** Management must be able to legally and regulatory transfer substantial amounts of capital (dividends) from the well-capitalized insurance subsidiary (National Public Finance Guarantee) up to the parent holding company (MBI Inc.).
3.  **No New Major Defaults:** The remaining legacy insurance book and the existing municipal bond portfolio must not suffer a sudden, major, unexpected default (e.g., a massive U.S. municipal bankruptcy or a significant deterioration in its structured finance recoveries) that would deplete capital reserves.
4.  **Management Execution:** The high level of insider ownership and managerial incentive translates into aggressive execution of the run-off strategy and efficient use of returned capital (e.g., consistent share repurchases at attractive prices).

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several significant flaws in the bullish thesis for MBIA Inc. (MBI), primarily stemming from the inherent uncertainty and external dependence of its core assumptions.

### Flaws and Faults in the Long Thesis

1.  **High Uncertainty and Timeline Risk in PREPA Resolution (Contradicts Assumption 1):** The final resolution of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) debt, which represents a claim in excess of $800 million for National, remains highly uncertain, subject to unpredictable political developments, and is the "primary risk" and a "gating issue" for advancing any major corporate strategy, including a sale. The bullish "re-rating" depends entirely on a **favorable** and **final** resolution, but the prolonged, complex nature of the Title III bankruptcy process means an unfavorable, costly, or multi-year delayed outcome is a significant possibility that would postpone any sharp re-rating.

2.  **Regulatory Hurdles to Capital Transfer (Contradicts Assumption 2):** The ability to transfer "vast amounts of excess cash" from the insurance subsidiary (National) to the parent company is not guaranteed, as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval is required for extraordinary dividends. While the holding company can declare dividends once the cash is received, the regulatory gatekeeper has no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future approvals, which is the crucial mechanism for shareholder return.

3.  **Ongoing Operating Losses and Book Value Deterioration:** The company continues to report consolidated GAAP net losses and negative earnings per share (EPS), with forward guidance suggesting negative EPS through FY 2026. This continuous capital depletion is driving the book value per share further negative (e.g., a decrease of $2.15 in the first half of 2025), which directly conflicts with the notion of "unlock[ing] substantial trapped cash" and undermines a simple run-off story.

4.  **Concentration and Idiosyncratic Credit Risk Remains (Contradicts Assumption 3):** Despite the general portfolio performance being consistent with expectations, the remaining legacy insurance book, which is non-diversified and in "run-off," has an inherently high concentration risk. A single, unexpected, large-scale US municipal bankruptcy (e.g., a major city or utility) could force National to materially increase its reserves, immediately halting any future dividend requests to the parent company.

5.  **Lack of Consistent Share Buyback Execution (Contradicts Assumption 4):** The bullish thesis relies on an aggressive "pure capital return story" with *consistent* share repurchases. However, management's current focus on resolving the PREPA exposure and exploring a company sale suggests that large buybacks may be on hold, with liquidity being conserved for other strategic priorities, including debt service and operating expenses, rather than *consistent* repurchase execution.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for MBIA Inc. (MBI)

The bear case for MBIA Inc. (MBI) centers on the high probability of a prolonged, messy, and potentially unfavorable resolution to its most material liability, which will indefinitely delay and possibly permanently impair the eventual return of capital to shareholders.

1.  **"Gating Issue" Risk will Remain for Years, Crushing the Re-rating:** The PREPA bankruptcy claim (>$800 million exposure) is the single biggest source of uncertainty, and its resolution is tied to unpredictable political and litigation timelines in Puerto Rico. The prolonged uncertainty and lack of a definitive favorable outcome will prevent the stock from achieving a significant re-rating, keeping a major overhang on the share price for years and pushing back the realization of any theoretical intrinsic value.
2.  **Regulatory Control Vetoes Capital Return:** The New York regulator (NYDFS) holds a veto power over "extraordinary dividends" from National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, which is the sole source of capital for the parent company to execute its buyback/return strategy. The regulator's focus on policyholder protection means they will likely maintain strict, conservative capital requirements, preventing the "vast amounts of excess cash" from being transferred, especially while the PREPA risk remains unresolved.
3.  **Negative Cash Flow Erodes Value:** The company's ongoing consolidated GAAP net losses and negative EPS will continue to erode its GAAP book value, which is already substantially negative, meaning shareholders are essentially holding an option on a highly complex litigation outcome while incurring carrying costs.
4.  **Capital is Tied Up and Unsaleable:** The business cannot be sold at an attractive price until the PREPA uncertainty is substantially reduced. If the PREPA outcome is unfavorable, the potential buyer appetite will diminish, or the price will reflect a significant discount, forcing management to pursue a lower-return run-off strategy that will take much longer than anticipated.
5.  **The Run-off is a Liquidation at a Discount:** The bull case promises a "capital return story," but the reality is an unmanaged liquidation. If the final value of the PREPA recovery is lower than management’s internal, conservative estimates or if a new major default occurs, the parent company will be left with insufficient cash (after servicing its own debt and operating expenses) to execute the massive share repurchases needed to create significant multiplying value per share.

## Next Steps

The initial analysis is comprehensive but needs quantification of the key value drivers and risks to properly assess the gap between the market price and the intrinsic value.

The search results provide key financial metrics as of June 30, 2025 (Q2 2025), which help answer several initial questions.

### Important Questions Still Left Unanswered & Next Steps

#### 1. Quantify the Intrinsic Value and Capital Unlock Potential

The central thesis is the release of capital from the National subsidiary. The question is how much.

*   **Determine National's Estimated Excess Capital:** **Investigate the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) capital standard** for monoline insurers. National currently has **\$914 million** in statutory capital and **\$1.5 billion** in claims-paying resources. How much of this **\$914 million** is legally *required* to be held, and how much is *excess* that could be returned?
*   **Clarify the Adjusted Book Value (ABV):** The GAAP book value is a negative **-\$43.14 per share**. You need to find the latest **Adjusted Book Value (ABV)** per share, which management uses to represent intrinsic value, and understand the assumptions behind its calculation (specifically the value assigned to National).

#### 2. Deep-Dive on the Primary Catalyst (PREPA Resolution)

The market is trading on the PREPA outcome, but the terms are vague.

*   **Find the Detailed PREPA Settlement Terms:** Search for the specifics of the **January 2023 Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA)** and the proposed Plan of Adjustment for PREPA. What are the **current recovery terms (e.g., cents on the dollar, new bond type)** that National is expected to receive for its paid claims?
*   **Assess the Litigation Risk/Timeline:** The search confirms the Plan of Adjustment is pending a First Circuit panel rehearing and other appeals. **Research the estimated judicial timeline** for the appeal process and mediation in the Puerto Rico Title III bankruptcy proceedings to estimate when the "gating issue" might be resolved.

#### 3. Quantify the Holding Company Liquidity and Debt Requirements

The holding company (MBIA Inc.) is where cash must flow for share repurchases.

*   **Analyze the Parent Company Debt Structure:** **Identify the quantum and maturity dates** of the corporate debt that MBIA Inc. must service. The search shows its cash position is decreasing, primarily due to interest payments on this debt.
*   **Estimate the Operating Cash Burn:** Calculate the **annual net operating cash burn** (operating expenses minus revenues, excluding insurance gains/losses) for the MBIA Inc. corporate segment to understand the minimum capital needed to sustain operations while waiting for a National dividend.

#### 4. Quantify the Legacy "Run-Off" Business (MBIA Corp.)

The "bad bank" must wind down cleanly.

*   **Quantify the Remaining Legacy Risk:** Find the current **estimated run-off life** for the MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA Corp.) insured book. The gross par outstanding was **\$2.2 billion** as of June 30, 2025, which is down from prior years, but the expected *timing* of its clean-up is key.
*   **Evaluate Zohar Recovery Estimates:** Management has had favorable adjustments on Zohar CDO recoveries. **Determine management's current, explicit, long-term recovery estimate** for the remaining Zohar assets.

#### Conclusion: Strategic Priority & Valuation

*   **Re-evaluate the Sale vs. Run-Off Strategy:** Management has stated the sale of National is a priority post-PREPA resolution. **Research market comparables (e.g., Assured Guaranty's valuation multiples)** for the municipal bond insurance segment to create a rough potential sale valuation for National and compare that to the value implied by a long-term capital return (share repurchase) scenario.
