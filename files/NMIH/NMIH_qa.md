## Business Summary

NMI Holdings, Inc. operates as a private mortgage insurance company in the United States, providing a safety net for residential mortgage lenders. The company’s core business model involves insuring lenders against financial losses when homebuyers default on loans, particularly those who make low down payments (less than 20%). Their primary customers are banks and mortgage companies (B2B) throughout the U.S. who utilize this insurance to mitigate risk, thereby allowing consumers to access home ownership with smaller upfront costs; revenue is primarily generated through the premiums paid for these insurance policies.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant risk is the company's dependency on the stability of the U.S. housing market and macro economy, as its profitability is directly tied to borrowers repaying their mortgages. A near-term spike in unemployment or an economic recession could quickly lead to increased claims, draining the company's capital reserves. Historically, this sector faced an existential crisis during the 2008 financial meltdown when a prolonged collapse in home values triggered massive simultaneous borrower defaults. A similar long-term decline in housing prices remains the primary concern, as it would substantially increase the losses NMIH must cover, severely harming its earnings and overall market position.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the story and mission of NMI Holdings, Inc., often known through its main subsidiary, National MI.

### **The History of NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH)**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Goal (Post-2008 Crisis)**

1.  **A Fresh Start:** NMI Holdings, Inc. was formally incorporated in May 2011, and its main subsidiary, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (National MI), was established in 2012.
2.  **The Crisis Motivation:** The company was founded directly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused in part by poorly underwritten mortgages.
3.  **The Core Goal:** Its mission was to restore trust in the private mortgage insurance (MI) industry by building a company focused on financial strength, transparency, and extremely careful underwriting standards.
4.  **Enabling Homeownership:** The business’s goal is to help qualified individuals buy homes, especially those who cannot afford a large 20% down payment, by providing an insurance policy that protects the mortgage lender.

#### **II. Early Milestones and Business Model**

5.  **How the Business Works:** NMIH provides private mortgage insurance (PMI), a product required by lenders when a home buyer makes a down payment of less than 20% of the home's price.
6.  **Protecting the Loan:** The insurance protects the lender (banks and mortgage companies) from losing money on a portion of the loan if the borrower is unable to make payments and defaults.
7.  **The Approval Hurdle:** A critical early step was securing approval in January 2013 from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which allows NMIH’s policies to be accepted by nearly all mortgage lenders nationwide.
8.  **Becoming Public:** After a period of organizational development, fundraising, and getting licensed across the country, the company's stock began trading publicly on the NASDAQ exchange in November 2013.

#### **III. Problems (Headwinds) Faced Along the Way**

9.  **The Competitive Headwind:** NMIH entered a market with long-established competitors, meaning it had to fight for market share against older, bigger private mortgage insurers.
10. **Economic Sensitivity:** As a financial services company tied to the housing market, its business performance is highly sensitive to major economic shifts like recessions, fluctuations in home prices, and unemployment rates.
11. **Interest Rate Challenges:** Periods of rising interest rates, such as those experienced in 2024–2025, create a strong headwind by making mortgages more expensive, which slows down the number of people buying homes and reduces demand for mortgage insurance.
12. **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The industry is heavily regulated, and changes in government housing policies or the rules governing the GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) pose a constant risk to the company's operations.

#### **IV. Innovative Solutions and Strategies for Success**

13. **Focus on Quality:** NMIH implemented a stringent and disciplined underwriting process from day one, which helped it build a portfolio of insured loans with the highest credit quality in the industry.
14. **Lowest Default Rate:** This careful selection and risk management strategy is their key innovative solution, which resulted in the company consistently having one of the lowest loan default rates among all mortgage insurers.
15. **Customer-Centric Approach:** The company focused on delivering superior customer service and fast, predictable decision-making to its lender partners to differentiate itself from competitors.
16. **Risk Transfer Solutions (Reinsurance):** To protect its own balance sheet from large losses, the company regularly uses "risk transfer solutions," essentially insuring their insurance through reinsurance agreements, which diversifies the risk.

#### **V. Tailwinds and Present Status**

17. **A Tail of a Clean Slate:** The single biggest tailwind was its founding date in 2012, which meant its entire portfolio was free of the high-risk loans written before the 2008 crisis, allowing it to be immediately seen as a strong, credible, and well-capitalized partner.
18. **Homeownership Demand:** Long-term tailwinds include strong, persistent demand for homeownership in the U.S. and the ongoing need for low-down-payment options, which is NMIH's core market.
19. **Present Day:** As of the mid-2020s, NMI Holdings is a major player in the mortgage insurance sector, known for its financial strength and highly conservative (low-risk) portfolio of insured loans.
20. **Continued Growth Goal:** The company's strategy is to continue expanding its share in the market, maintain its superior underwriting quality, and leverage its strong financial standing to deliver consistent returns for its shareholders.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," of NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) in the private mortgage insurance (MI) industry is built less on proprietary products and more on a superior business model and technology platform that creates **better risk management and higher certainty** for its customers (mortgage lenders).

Here is an analysis of the company's moat, differentiation, and growth drivers:

### 1. The Historical Reason for Growth and Differentiation

*   **Pioneering Lender Assurance:** NMIH's initial breakthrough, and the reason for its rapid growth since its 2012 founding, was introducing the **National MI SafeGuard™** product.
*   **Reduced Rescission Risk:** This product was groundbreaking because it offered lenders assurance that NMIH would not cancel their mortgage insurance (MI) coverage (rescission relief) after only **12 timely borrower payments**, significantly shorter than the industry standard of 36 months at the time.
*   **The Key Differentiator:** By reducing the lender’s risk of having to buy back a defaulted loan (repurchase risk), this value proposition won the trust of key lenders and allowed NMIH to rapidly expand its customer franchise in a mature industry.

### 2. Market Position and Pricing Power

*   **Pricing Power from Risk Selection:** While the MI market is highly competitive with six active private insurers and government alternatives, NMIH’s special position comes from its superior ability to **select and price risk** rather than simply offering the lowest price to everyone.
*   **Proprietary Risk-Based Pricing:** The company uses its proprietary **Rate GPS®** platform to dynamically evaluate and price risk on a loan-by-loan basis. This technological edge allows them to offer highly competitive rates for low-risk loans while maintaining strong profitability, a form of competitive advantage based on *better information*.
*   **High-Quality, Low-Loss Book:** Their disciplined risk-management strategy has resulted in a book of insured mortgages with a strong credit profile and historically low loss ratios, which is crucial for long-term financial stability and market confidence.

### 3. Customer and Contract Stickiness

*   **Recurring Revenue Model:** The core business is highly sticky and recurring. A new MI policy, which is necessary for a borrower with a low down payment, is a long-term contract that contributes to the company's growing **primary insurance-in-force** portfolio, generating a consistent, recurring stream of net premiums earned.
*   **Regulatory Barriers/Trust:** The customer base (lenders) must use a mortgage insurer that is an **eligible counterparty** under the strict financial and operational standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (called PMIERs). The time and effort a lender invests in integrating a new MI provider's technology into its loan origination system creates **high switching costs** and strong stickiness.
*   **Technology Integration as a Network Effect:** NMIH invests in its proprietary **AXIS** platform and works to make its quoting and ordering process frictionless for lenders through API integrations with partners like PMI Rate Pro. This ease of doing business and system compatibility for lenders makes them less likely to switch, strengthening the network-like effect with their mortgage originator customers.

### 4. Displacement and Moat Building

*   **High Barrier to Entry (Capital and Regulation):** While an existing competitor with more capital can compete fiercely, a completely new entrant would face massive challenges. They would need not just capital, but a **PMIERs-compliant operating platform** and a multi-year track record to establish the necessary trust with the Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and lenders.
*   **Moat as Risk Management and Capital:** The solid moat is created by two non-replicable factors: (1) a **disciplined, ten-year history** of underwriting high-quality risk that few competitors can match, and (2) maintaining a very strong balance sheet with significant **excess PMIERs funding capacity**, which is a non-negotiable requirement for all lenders.
*   **Technology Investment (R&D):** The company must constantly invest in technology (Rate GPS®, AXIS) and seamless integrations to maintain its edge in underwriting and operational efficiency. The advantage is not a patent, but a constantly improving *system* that allows it to select better risks and operate at a lower cost than its peers, reflected in its record-low expense ratios.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that might increase NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) stock price in the near and long term are focused on its strong financial performance, disciplined capital strategy, and favorable housing market dynamics.

### **Near-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Consistent Share Repurchases (Capital Return):** The company is actively returning capital to shareholders, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and can boost earnings per share. Management has authorized an additional $\$250$ million repurchase plan and expects to maintain a consistent buyback pace of about $\$25$ million per quarter.

2.  **Strong and Improving Financial Results:** The company has recently reported record revenues, net income, and earnings per share (EPS). Continuing this trend with positive surprises in upcoming quarterly reports, especially in the Q3 2025 results scheduled for November, could immediately lift the stock price.

3.  **Positive Housing Market Conditions:** Management has described the overall macro environment and housing market as "resilient" or "stabilizing." Continued low mortgage default rates and solid cure rates, coupled with an increase in mortgage originations, would drive profitable business growth and lead to higher net premiums earned.

### **Long-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Growth in Insurance-in-Force (IIF):** The company's primary insurance-in-force, which represents the total value of mortgages it is insuring, continues to grow (up 7% year-over-year as of Q4 2024). This growing portfolio creates a stable base for future premium revenue over many years.

2.  **High Persistency Rate:** The rate at which insurance policies remain on the books (**persistency**) is high, which is better than historical trends. Management’s focus on this is important, as it minimizes policy cancellations and ensures a steady, long-term stream of premium income from the existing insurance book.

3.  **Disciplined Risk Management and Capital Strength:** NMIH maintains available assets that significantly exceed the minimum required by regulators (PMIERs), which underpins its stability. Management's strategy of disciplined risk management and a balanced capital funding approach is designed to maintain a high-quality, long-lasting insured portfolio.

4.  **Strategic Reinsurance Agreements:** New reinsurance agreements announced for business originated between 2025 and 2027 help the company manage its risk exposure and maintain its financial strength, which is key for long-term operational stability and growth.

### **Management's Stated Strategy and Catalysts**

*   **CEO Adam Pollitzer** and the management team emphasize that their strategy centers on offering a **low-cost, high-value solution** to expand homeownership opportunities while protecting investors.
*   They view their **capital return program (share repurchases)** as essential for maintaining a "right funding balance" and driving value for shareholders.
*   A key element is the **expansion of the customer base** and the **growth of the insured portfolio** through strong relationships and disciplined risk practices.
*   They have repeatedly highlighted the company's **record financial performance** and the operating leverage in the business, pointing to the sustained strength of the housing market as a positive factor.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of the NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) DEF 14A proxy materials, here is an assessment of the management incentive and compensation structure:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Overall Insider Ownership Percentage:** The beneficial ownership of all executive officers and directors as a group is **3.0%** of the common stock as of March 11, 2025 (14 persons). This percentage is moderate and not high enough on its own to suggest maximum alignment.
2.  **High Stock Ownership Guidelines:** The company mandates substantial minimum stock ownership requirements for its leadership team to align interests with shareholders.
    *   The CEO is required to hold stock valued at **6 times** their base salary.
    *   Non-employee directors are required to hold stock valued at **6 times** their annual cash retainer.
    *   Other senior executives (CFO/President) must hold stock valued at **3 times** their base salary.
3.  **Retention Requirement:** Executives and directors are required to achieve their ownership level within five years and must retain at least **50% of the net shares** received from equity vesting or option exercise until the required ownership level is met. These guidelines create a powerful, mandatory incentive for long-term ownership and share price appreciation.

#### **Compensation Structure and Performance Focus**

1.  **Performance-Based Pay Focus:** The executive compensation program emphasizes "performance-based compensation," utilizing annual cash awards and long-term equity to motivate and reward short and long-term results. [cite: 3 (from step 2)]
2.  **Long-Term Equity Metrics:** A significant portion of the long-term incentive is granted through Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs), which are tied to shareholder-friendly performance goals. [cite: 3 (from step 2)]
3.  **Specific Shareholder-Aligned Metrics:** The 2024 PRSU grants are specifically linked to **Operating Return on Equity (ROE) & Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Growth Targets**. [cite: 3 (from step 2)] These metrics focus on profitable growth and maximizing a core measure of shareholder value over a multi-year period, directly tying executive wealth to the company's financial success.
4.  **Equity Dominance in Pay Mix:** For senior roles, the target annual equity-based award is a large multiple of the base salary (e.g., up to 190% of base salary for the CFO). [cite: 7 (from step 2)] This means the majority of an executive's potential total direct compensation is in the form of equity (RSUs and PRSUs).

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

NMI Holdings' management appears to have **strong incentives to act in the interest of shareholders**.

*   While the current aggregate insider ownership percentage is moderate at 3.0%, the mandated **high stock ownership guidelines** (up to 6x base salary/retainer) coupled with a **share retention requirement** force management to be long-term shareholders. This structure is designed to mitigate the risk of executives "lining their own pockets" with short-term gains.
*   The use of **Operating ROE and BVPS Growth** as performance metrics for long-term equity compensation is a direct alignment tool, as these financial measures are key drivers of long-term shareholder value. [cite: 3 (from step 2)]
*   The compensation mix is heavily weighted toward **at-risk, performance-based equity**, indicating that management's overall compensation is primarily dependent on achieving multi-year operational and stock-related objectives. [cite: 7 (from step 2)]

## Price History

The price history and technical analysis for NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH) reveal a stock currently experiencing a significant pullback despite strong underlying financial performance.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock was recently trading near **\$35.92** (as of October 14, 2025), placing it within a 52-week trading range of **\$31.90** (low) to **\$43.20** (high).

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The current price of \$35.92 is approximately **12.60%** above its 52-week low of \$31.90.

3.  **Technical Analysis: Is It Trading Low?** Based on classic technical indicators as of mid-October 2025, the stock shows mixed signals suggesting a low price point. Multiple Moving Averages generate a "Strong Sell" signal, and the stock recently broke below its 200-day moving average, a bearish signal. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the "Oversold" territory, which suggests the stock may be trading low in the short term and could be due for a rebound.

4.  **Big Drop in Recent Months:** The stock has seen a significant drop, falling approximately **9.54%** over the last month and roughly **14%** over the last three months, showing weakness despite strong reported earnings. This decline includes a streak where the price fell for 10 consecutive days.

5.  **Explanation for the Price Drop vs. Fundamentals:** The recent price weakness is particularly notable because it follows strong financial results, including a record Q2 2025, with robust revenue, strong EPS growth, and an increase in primary insurance-in-force. This disparity has led some analyses to suggest the stock is "significantly undervalued" and "Overlooked And Overly Cheap," trading at a P/E of around 7.7x and a high earnings yield compared to the S&P 500.

6.  **Analyst Outlook:** The stock holds a consensus "Buy" rating among analysts, with a 12-month average price target of **\$42.33**, which implies an upside of over 16% from current levels. The target range is between \$41.00 and \$49.00.

## Long Thesis

NMIH is a high-quality, undervalued stock poised for strong returns because it operates in a necessary market (making homeownership affordable) while carrying the lowest risk profile among its peers. In the near term, the stock is oversold, meaning it has dropped too much despite record earnings, making it cheap. Management is actively buying back stock, which immediately raises profits per share and should cause a rebound. Long term, the company’s core advantage is its technological ability to select only the safest, highest-quality borrowers, resulting in a low-risk book of insured loans that continuously grows. This growing, safe portfolio generates predictable, recurring premium income, ensuring exceptional financial stability and long-lasting profitability for shareholders.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the U.S. housing market avoids a severe, prolonged downturn or crash. We assume the unemployment rate remains low, as high job loss would instantly trigger widespread borrower defaults. Furthermore, we assume NMIH maintains its disciplined underwriting standards and technological edge to keep selecting low-risk loans, and management continues its aggressive stock repurchase program to return capital to shareholders.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies flaws and potential risks in the bull thesis for NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH), presenting a counter-argument (bear case).

## Flaws and Faults in the Bull Thesis (NMIH)

### 1. Challenge to the "Oversold" and "Immediate Rebound" Narrative

*   **Stock Underperformance is a Reality, not just "Oversold":** The stock has underperformed both the broader U.S. market and its immediate diversified financial industry peers over the past year. A significant drop or stagnation in the face of consistent earnings growth suggests the market is pricing in substantial macro-economic risk, not just a temporary "oversold" condition.
*   **Recent Earnings Momentum is Mixed:** While full-year financial results have been strong, the momentum has slowed or missed expectations in recent quarters. For instance, the adjusted EPS for Q4 2024 missed analyst estimates, and net income in Q2 2025 saw a slight sequential decline. This mixed short-term performance justifies investor caution, rather than proving the stock is simply "oversold."
*   **Stock Buybacks Are Not a Guaranteed Catalyst:** While management is actively repurchasing shares and has authorized an additional \$250 million, this capital return has not yet been sufficient to reverse the stock's underperformance or trigger the anticipated rebound. In a bear market scenario, buybacks may just slow the decline, not prevent it.

### 2. Challenge to the "Lowest Risk Profile" and "Technological Edge"

*   **Risk Profile is Largely Untested by Recession:** NMIH is a relatively young mortgage insurer, incorporated in 2011, and has not fully endured a severe, prolonged economic recession or a significant housing crash like the one in 2008. Its currently "low-risk" portfolio is a product of an unprecedented low-default environment, and its underwriting system lacks a stress-test history.
*   **The "Technological Edge" is Not Proven to Be Proprietary:** The thesis touts a "technological ability to select only the safest... borrowers," but this is a claim common to modern MI companies. While NMIH is credited with a "more defensive credit profile than peers," without proprietary, patented technology or a significantly lower long-term loss rate through a full economic cycle, this "edge" is likely an industry-wide best practice rather than a sustainable competitive advantage.
*   **Peer-Based Low Risk is Relative and Ephemeral:** Some peer MI companies, like Essent Group, boast similar or superior high-quality credit metrics (e.g., lower average loan-to-value and higher average FICO scores). This suggests NMIH's "lowest risk profile" is a narrow, relative distinction that can be quickly eroded by peer competition or a shift in the origination environment.

### 3. Exposure to Macro-Economic and Systemic Risk

*   **Single-Point Failure Risk (The Main Assumption):** The entire thesis hinges on the primary assumption that the U.S. housing market and unemployment rate remain stable. In a mortgage insurance company, all risks converge to one primary threat: **a sharp and sustained rise in unemployment.** If the unemployment rate rises, especially if combined with depressed home prices, the portfolio's "safe" status will collapse, regardless of initial FICO scores.
*   **Interest Rate Impact on Persistency:** The rapid rise in interest rates has a dual negative effect on mortgage insurers: it has dampened new loan origination volume (new business) and **slowed down mortgage prepayments (lower persistency)**. Low prepayments keep older, higher-risk, lower-rate policies on the books for longer, delaying the turnover to NMIH's supposedly safer new book and tying up capital.
*   **Regulatory Risk and Competition from Government Agencies:** Private MI companies like NMIH constantly face competition from Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A change in GSE guidelines or an increase in their market share could immediately reduce the addressable market and compress premium pricing for NMIH, regardless of its underwriting quality.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH)

NMIH is a highly cyclical financial company trading at a seemingly attractive valuation, but this discount reflects the market's justified fear of a macro credit cycle turn, not a temporary market mispricing. The company's future is overwhelmingly exposed to systemic risks, which will quickly negate its credit-focused advantages.

1.  **Imminent Macroeconomic Reversion Will Tank the Portfolio:** The core assumption of a stable housing market is dangerously optimistic. A looming recession, triggered by a persistent high interest rate environment or an unexpected spike in unemployment, would immediately reverse NMIH's "industry-leading" low default rates. Mortgage insurance is a levered bet on the economy, and its earnings and stock price will be decimated by any significant credit deterioration.
2.  **Competitive Parity Nullifies the "Technological Edge":** The claim of a unique technological edge is largely marketing rhetoric, as all major private mortgage insurers utilize advanced analytics and disciplined underwriting. When the inevitable downturn hits, the differences in loss ratios across peers will be marginal, thus exposing NMIH as just another cyclical player, stripping its premium valuation and leading to a multiple contraction.
3.  **Capital Return is a Headwind, Not a Tailwind:** The ongoing stock buyback program, while shareholder-friendly, is a tactical maneuver that is failing to offset market-wide skepticism. The cash used for buybacks could instead be retained to build a larger capital buffer, which will be desperately needed to cover claims and maintain regulatory standing when the credit cycle turns, forcing management to stop buybacks at the worst possible time.
4.  **Growth is Dead in a High-Rate Environment:** A prolonged high-interest rate environment will continue to suppress new mortgage origination volume (New Insurance Written) and keep high-risk, lower-rate policies on the books longer (lower persistency), effectively stunting the company’s portfolio growth and tying up the capital that would otherwise be fueling the P/E multiple-boosting growth narrative.

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis of your work and the supplemental investigation, here are the most important remaining questions and next steps to solidify your long thesis and directly counter the bear case.

### **Important Questions Still Left Unanswered**

#### **1. Valuation and Historical Context**
*   **Is NMIH's Valuation Truly "Oversold" or Just Average?** Your analysis notes the stock is currently trading at a P/E of **~7.7x**, which is below its 3-year average of 7.87x and 5-year average of 7.97x, suggesting it is *relatively* cheap for NMIH. However, you need to compare this P/E directly against the *current* and *historical* P/E multiples of its key peers (ESNT, MTG, RDN). This will determine if the low multiple reflects NMIH-specific fear or is simply the low multiple of the entire cyclical MI industry.
*   **What is the P/E Discount to the Housing Market Cycle?** The bear case relies on cyclical risk. How does the current 7.7x P/E compare to the P/E multiples the company achieved at the *prior peak* of the last housing cycle (2017-2018) to gauge the market's expectation of a downturn?

#### **2. The Endurance of the "Lowest Risk" Credit Profile**
*   **What is the Total Loss Severity Trend?** While NMIH has one of the lowest current loss *ratios* (3.0% in Q1 2025 vs. peers' higher default rates), it's also a young portfolio. You should investigate the **loss severity** metrics—the actual dollar loss per defaulted loan—for NMIH versus its older peers. If NMIH's loans have higher LTVs at default, their claim losses could be disproportionately higher in a down-cycle.
*   **Has Competitor Rescission Relief Truly Matched National MI SafeGuard™?** The 12-month rescission relief is a confirmed historical differentiator. The remaining question is whether every major competitor (Arch, Essent, MGIC, Radian) has fully *guaranteed* 12-month rescission relief on **all loans (Delegated and Non-Delegated)** without an independent validation, which is a significant operational hurdle. Search for the most current Master Policy terms for other major MI firms.

#### **3. Execution and Quantitative Impact of Catalysts**
*   **What is the Exact EPS Uplift from Buybacks?** The bear case argues that buybacks are failing to move the stock. You need to quantify the precise impact: calculate the percentage reduction in shares outstanding from the buyback program and then calculate the resulting increase in Diluted EPS (i.e., Net Income / New Lower Share Count). This figure will directly determine the efficiency and magnitude of the capital return catalyst.
*   **Is NMIH Gaining Market Share?** The market volume for new insurance written (NIW) is generally down due to high interest rates. You have the Q2 2025 NIW volume for all major players. Calculate the **quarterly market share** for NMIH and its peers over the last four quarters to see if NMIH is gaining share (which supports the growth thesis) or losing it (which supports the stagnation argument in the bear case).

---

### **Next Steps to Investigate Further**

1.  **Peer Valuation and Market Share Deep Dive:**
    *   Find the current P/E, P/B, and P/E to Growth (PEG) ratios for **Essent (ESNT), MGIC (MTG), and Radian (RDN)** to create a direct quantitative valuation table for all players.
    *   Find a consensus analyst report on **PMI market share trends** over the last 12-18 months to see if NMIH's growth in IIF is market-share driven or simply a rising tide effect.

2.  **Credit Quality and Claims Analysis:**
    *   Search for "Loss Severity" or "Claim Severity" comparisons across the major private mortgage insurers for the most recent quarters.
    *   Specifically search for "MGIC 12-month rescission relief" and "Radian 12-month rescission relief" to test the precise language against NMIH's industry-leading policy.

3.  **Capital Return Metrics:**
    *   Look up NMIH's "Shares Outstanding" from the Q2 2025 balance sheet and compare it to the Q4 2024 number to directly calculate the share reduction and quantify the true EPS benefit from buybacks.
