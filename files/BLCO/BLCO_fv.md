### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025–2030)

The core business engine for Bausch + Lomb is driven by the performance of its premium/innovative products in three main segments: Vision Care, Pharmaceuticals, and Surgical.

**Key Growth Drivers (The Engine):**
1.  **Pharmaceuticals:** Strong ramp-up of two major dry eye products: **Miebo** (reported 71% YoY growth in Q3 2025) and **Xiidra** (acquired in 2023, delivered $87M in Q3 2025).
2.  **Vision Care:** Above-market growth, specifically in the Contact Lens portfolio, led by **Daily SiHy** (up 24% in Q3 2025). Future launches include Blink triple care preservative-free drops (H1 2026) and a highly anticipated "bioactive lens" (expected 2028) with projected peak sales that could nearly double the contact lens business.
3.  **Surgical:** Recovery from product recalls (enVista), driving strong performance in Premium IOLs (27% constant currency growth in premiums).
4.  **Margin Expansion:** Management has a clear long-term target of 23% Adjusted EBITDA margin by 2028, up from ~17% (2025 guidance), driven by cost discipline and manufacturing efficiency gains.

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions USD) | YoY Growth (Conservative Assumption) | Justification/Engine Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $4,791 | N/A | Baseline. [cite: 3 in Step 2] |
| **2025 (Projected)**| $5,100 | 6.45% | Management's revised full-year guidance midpoint ($5.05B - $5.15B). |
| **2026 (Projected)**| $5,406 | **6.0%** | Reflects new product launches (e.g., Blink drops) and continued strong Miebo/Xiidra ramp-up. *Conservative*, within the 5%-7% long-term target. |
| **2027 (Projected)**| $5,703 | **5.5%** | Continued, robust growth from the core business and full recovery of surgical, but pre-dating the major 2028 bioactive lens launch. |
| **2028 (Projected)**| $5,988 | **5.0%** | Reflects the initial momentum from the anticipated transformative **bioactive lens** launch, while maintaining a *conservative* cap. |
| **2029 (Projected)**| $6,257 | **4.5%** | Reflects stabilization of the new product launches and a **conservative** slowdown as the company approaches maturity. |
| **2030 (Projected)**| $6,450 | **3.0%** | A significant slowdown to maintain **conservatism** before the terminal value calculation. |

### III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection

The Net Income (NI) projection is conservative, assuming a slow return to GAAP profitability despite ambitious Adjusted EBITDA targets, reflecting the company's historical losses.

| Metric | FY 2024 (Actual) | 2025 (Proj) | 2026 (Proj) | 2027 (Proj) | 2028 (Proj) | 2029 (Proj) | 2030 (Proj) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (A)** | $4,791 | $5,100 | $5,406 | $5,703 | $5,988 | $6,257 | $6,450 |
| **NI Margin (B)** | -6.6% | -5.0% | -2.0% | 1.0% | 4.0% | 5.0% | 6.0% |
| **Projected NI (C) = A * B** | -$317 | -$255 | -$108 | $57 | $240 | $313 | $387 |
| **ROIC %** | N/A | **2.0%** | **2.0%** | **2.0%** | **2.0%** | **2.0%** | **2.0%** |
| **ROIC Income (D)** | N/A | N/A | C_2025 * ROIC% | C_2026 * ROIC% | C_2027 * ROIC% | C_2028 * ROIC% | C_2029 * ROIC% |
| **ROIC Income (D)** | N/A | N/A | -$5 | -$2 | $1 | $5 | $6 |
| **Cash Flow (NI) (E) = C + D** | N/A | -$255 | -$113 | $55 | $241 | $318 | $393 |
| **Discount Factor (10.0%)** | N/A | 0.909 | 0.826 | 0.751 | 0.683 | 0.621 | 0.564 |
| **NPV of Cash Flow (F)** | N/A | -$232 | -$93 | $41 | $164 | $197 | $222 |

**Net Income Margin Justification:**

*   **2025-2026 (Losses):** Reflects continued high investment in R&D (~7.5% of revenue) and selling/promotion costs (e.g., Miebo), and significant interest expense (approx. $375M, nearly 7.4% of 2025 revenue).
*   **2027 (Profitability):** Assumes the initial investment in product launches begins to pay off, reaching small GAAP profitability as margins begin to expand toward the 2028 target.
*   **2028-2030 (Profit Growth):** The 4.0% - 6.0% Net Income Margin for 2028-2030 is **highly conservative** given the management target of **23% Adjusted EBITDA margin by 2028**. This cushion accounts for ongoing high interest expense due to debt and necessary GAAP adjustments (e.g., amortization of acquired intangibles).

**ROIC Justification:**
*   Historical GAAP ROE/NI is poor or negative. Per the rule, a conservative but reasonable *positive* ROIC must be used.
*   A **2.0% ROIC** is chosen. This is a very modest return, consistent with the *conservative* mandate, on the portion of cash generated from previous net income, reflecting the stable but highly competitive eye care industry.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%** (Conservative, high rate chosen due to the company's current negative GAAP profitability and high debt level ($4.7B, which is over 1.2x its current market cap of ~$5.87B)). [cite: 5, 12 in Step 3]
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%** (Conservative, below long-term GDP growth and market's expected growth of 4%-6%).

**Sum of Net Present Value (NPV) of Explicit Forecast Period (2025-2030):**
$NPV_{2025-2030} = -$232 + -$93 + $41 + $164 + $197 + $222 = **$299 Million**

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
The 2030 Cash Flow ($393M) is assumed to grow at the conservative terminal growth rate (2.0%) indefinitely.

$TV_{2030} = (CashFlow_{2030} * (1 + g)) / (r - g)$
$TV_{2030} = ($393 * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02)$
$TV_{2030} = ($393 * 1.02) / 0.08$
$TV_{2030} = $400.86 / 0.08$
$TV_{2030} = **$5,011 Million**

**NPV of Terminal Value:**
$NPV_{TV} = TV_{2030} * DiscountFactor_{2030}$
$NPV_{TV} = $5,011 * 0.564 = **$2,826 Million**

**Total Enterprise Value (EV):**
$EV = NPV_{2025-2030} + NPV_{TV}$
$EV = $299 Million + $2,826 Million = **$3,125 Million**

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** | $3,125 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $332 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -$4,744 |
| **Equity Value (Fair Value of Business)** | **-$1,287** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**
$Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding$
$Fair Value Per Share = -$1,287 Million / 354.2 Million Shares = **-$3.63**

---

## Conclusion and Justification

**Calculated Fair Value of BLCO Stock: -$3.63 per share**

**Current Market Value (Approximate):** Based on the search results, the stock price is approximately $17.00. [cite: 12 in Step 3]

### Justification for Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of -$3.63 is significantly lower than the current market value of approximately $17.00, resulting in a **negative equity value** for the company.

**Why the Valuation is Negative:**
The negative valuation is primarily a function of the **high total debt ($4.744 billion)** compared to the calculated Enterprise Value ($3.125 billion). This calculation implies that even a conservative estimate of the company's future cash flows from operations is insufficient to cover its current debt obligations.

**Why the Market Disagrees (What the Market is Assuming):**

The market is making a far more optimistic assumption about two key factors:

1.  **Significantly Higher Long-Term Profitability (Net Income):**
    *   The market is taking management's **23% Adjusted EBITDA margin target by 2028** as a precursor to much higher GAAP Net Income margins than the conservative 4-6% assumed here.
    *   The market is likely assuming the company will generate $500M - $1B in annual *Net Income* post-2028 as the new product pipeline (bioactive lens, Miebo/Xiidra) matures and manufacturing efficiencies (a core management focus) kick in to significantly reduce the cost of goods sold.

2.  **Successful Deleveraging and/or a Lower Discount Rate:**
    *   The market is pricing in the expectation that Bausch + Lomb will successfully execute its strategy to improve **Net Leverage to 3.5x by the end of 2028** by converting its Adjusted EBITDA to cash flow to pay down debt. A successful deleveraging would reduce the *Total Debt* figure in the fair value calculation.
    *   A lower perceived risk (e.g., a **7-8% Discount Rate**) is likely being used by the market, which would significantly increase the $3.125 billion Enterprise Value.

**My Conservative Position:**

The valuation's negative result is the direct consequence of adhering to the mandate to be **conservative** and using **GAAP Net Income** (even with a modest ROIC) as the measure of cash flow. The core reason is:

*   **Financial Reality of High Debt:** A $4.744 billion debt load is substantial for a company that is currently generating a negative GAAP Net Income and has an EV of $3.125 billion based on conservative long-term projections. The market's valuation of $17.00/share suggests an Equity Value of $6.0B (354.2M shares * $17.00), which implies an EV of over **$10.7 billion** ($6.0B + $4.7B Debt). The market is projecting a sustained, high-growth, high-margin future far beyond the most conservative estimates.

**Justification:** The valuation is a *conservative* one, which correctly flags the risk of the company's **high leverage** in the face of ongoing GAAP losses, despite an exciting product pipeline and margin expansion plan. A 10.0% discount rate and a conservative margin path (1.0% NI margin in first profitable year) are warranted given the company's history of net losses and the large debt overhang. The fair value is negative because, under these strict and conservative assumptions, the value of the future cash flows does not exceed the outstanding debt.
