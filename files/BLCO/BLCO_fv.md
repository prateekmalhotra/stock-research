## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Bausch + Lomb's business engine is driven by three main segments: Vision Care, Surgical, and Pharmaceuticals, with the strongest organic growth concentrated in premium products and new launches.

| Business Segment Driver | Management Commentary & Growth Trajectory |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vision Care (Contact Lens & Consumer)** | Strong, above-market performance led by Daily SiHy contact lenses (up 24% in Q3 2025) and the Consumer dry eye portfolio (up 18% in Q3 2025, driven by Miebo, Artelac, and Blink). This is the stable, high-growth core of the business. |
| **Pharmaceuticals (Xiidra & Miebo)** | **Miebo** is a significant growth accelerant, with revenue jumping from $63 million in Q2 2025 to $84 million in Q3 2025 (a 71% YoY increase), indicating a strong launch and uptake. Xiidra is also a consistent performer. |
| **Surgical** | Momentum is being regained after the enVista recall, with full recovery of the IOL business anticipated by Q1 2026. This segment provides a clear, near-term catalyst for accelerated growth post-2025. |
| **Strategic Pillar** | Management introduced a **Vision '27 strategy** focused on "financial excellence" and a loaded pipeline of disruptive, clinical-stage products for launch over the next few years, signaling confidence in sustained above-market growth. |

### Revenue Assumptions

The projections are based on management's guidance and a conservative long-term deceleration reflecting market maturity and competition.

| Year | Rationale | Projected Revenue (in Millions USD) | YoY Growth (Constant Currency) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base Year)** | Midpoint of the revised 2025 guidance ($5.05B - $5.15B). This assumes 6% constant currency growth, absorbing $\sim\$55M$ in one-time enVista recall headwinds. | $5,100$ | 6.4% (Reported) |
| **2026** | **5.5%** growth. This assumes the full recovery of the high-margin Surgical segment by Q1 2026, strong continued growth in Miebo and Daily SiHy, offset by conservative deceleration in the base business. | $5,381$ | 5.5% |
| **2027** | **5.0%** growth. This aligns with the "Vision '27" outlook for sustained above-market growth, fueled by pipeline launches and Miebo approaching peak sales. | $5,650$ | 5.0% |
| **2028** | **4.5%** growth. Deceleration as product launches mature and the base growth rate slows. | $5,904$ | 4.5% |
| **2029** | **4.0%** growth. Further deceleration toward a long-term growth rate. | $6,140$ | 4.0% |
| **2030** | **3.5%** growth. Conservative long-term rate, still above a typical mature healthcare company, reflecting the strong eye-care market. | $6,355$ | 3.5% |

## 3. Margin Projections and Net Income Calculation

### Margin Assumptions

| Metric | 2024 Actual | 2025 Guidance | 2026 - 2030 Assumption | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin %** | $62.6\%$ (Adjusted) | $\sim 61.5\%$ (Adjusted) | $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbf{64.0\%}$ | Starts below 2024 due to enVista recall/mix, then gradually improves as the high-margin Surgical segment recovers, Miebo scales, and "financial excellence" cost discipline takes hold. |
| **R&D % of Revenue** | $7.1\%$ (Adjusted) | $\sim 7.5\%$ | $\mathbf{7.0\%}$ | Conservative reduction from the current high-launch year investment, reflecting management's new focus on disciplined resource allocation post-Vision '27. |
| **SGA % of Revenue** | $45.6\%$ (Calculated) | $\mathbf{44.4\%}$ (Implied) | $\mathbf{43.0\%}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbf{40.0\%}$ | Calculated: 2024 Revenue: $4,791M$. 2024 Gross Profit: $4,791M * 62.6\% = 3,000M$. 2024 Op. Loss: $-100M$. SG\&A + R\&D = $3,100M$. R\&D: $4,791M * 7.1\% = 340M$. SGA = $2,760M / 4,791M = 57.6\%$. *Correction*: Using Net Loss for 2024: $\mathbf{SG\&A + Opex}$ is assumed to trend down from 2025's implied $5,100M * (1 - 61.5\% - 7.5\%) = 45\%$. This reflects the "financial excellence" pillar. |
| **Operating Margin %** | $-2.1\%$ (GAAP) | $\mathbf{9.6\%}$ (Adjusted EBITDA Midpoint $890M / 5,100M$) | $\mathbf{12.0\%}$ $\rightarrow$ $\mathbf{16.0\%}$ | This reflects the dramatic shift to profitability as a result of revenue growth, margin improvement, and cost control. |
| **Net Interest Expense** | $\sim \$384M$ (2024) | $\sim \$375M$ | $\mathbf{\$375M}$ (Flat) | Held flat due to high debt level and conservative assumption that any minor debt paydown is offset by rate changes, reflecting the company's deleveraging challenge. |
| **Tax Rate** | $0\%$ (Losses) | $0\%$ (Losses) | $\mathbf{21\%}$ | A standard conservative US corporate rate, applied only once the company achieves sustained GAAP profitability. |

### Conservative ROIC Assumption

The company currently has a GAAP net loss, resulting in a negative historical ROIC. Per the rules for a turnaround scenario, a **conservative but reasonable positive ROIC** must be assumed.
*   **Assumed ROIC Rate:** **3.0%**
*   **Rationale:** This is a very conservative, low rate, slightly above a risk-free rate, which acknowledges the high debt and the early stage of the company's profitability and capital allocation strategy ("financial excellence") without overstating its new income generation capacity.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Adjusted Net Income (line **I**) is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for the purpose of this simple valuation model, as per the rule: *assume that net income for each year goes straight into cash*.

### Discount Rate & Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**
    *   *Rationale:* This rate is higher than the typical cost of capital for a stable, investment-grade firm, reflecting the company's high leverage, its recent negative net income, and its ongoing transition phase. It provides a significant margin of safety.
*   **Terminal Maturity Rate (Very Conservative):** **2.0%**
    *   *Rationale:* A very conservative perpetual growth rate, which is below the expected long-term GDP growth and well below the assumed 2030 growth rate of 3.5%.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Adj. Net Income (FCFF) (M USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 10.0%)^t) | NPV of FCFF (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (2025)** | $91$ | $0.909$ | $83$ |
| **2 (2026)** | $217$ | $0.826$ | $179$ |
| **3 (2027)** | $313$ | $0.751$ | $235$ |
| **4 (2028)** | $389$ | $0.683$ | $266$ |
| **5 (2029)** | $467$ | $0.621$ | $290$ |
| **6 (2030)** | $521$ | $0.564$ | $294$ |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$1,347$** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030)

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{FCFF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$521 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$531.42 \text{M}}{0.08} = \$6,643 \text{M}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}_{2030}}{\left(1 + 0.10\right)^{6}} = \frac{\$6,643 \text{M}}{1.772} = \$3,749 \text{M}
$$

| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$5,096 \text{M}$** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *(Sum of NPV 2025-2030 + NPV of Terminal Value)* | | | |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A. Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $5,096$ |
| **B. Total Cash & Equivalents** | $310$ |
| **C. Total Debt** | $4,922$ |
| **D. Equity Value (A + B - C)** | **$474$** |
| **E. Shares Outstanding** | $354.19$ |
| **F. Fair Value Per Share (D / E)** | **$1.34** |

---

## **FAIR VALUE PER SHARE: $1.34**

| Comparison Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$1.34** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$15.14** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **$1.34** is dramatically lower than the current market price of **$15.14**. The market is making significantly more optimistic assumptions than this conservative DCF model.

#### **Market's Optimistic Assumptions (Why the market is $\sim 10x$ higher):**

1.  **Massive Turnaround and Margin Expansion:** The market is pricing in a much faster and more aggressive ramp-up of profitability, likely projecting Operating Margins to exceed 20-25% in the out-years. The company's **$890M** adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 (17.5% margin) is significantly higher than the $\mathbf{\$490M}$ Operating Income projected in this model (9.6% margin), suggesting the market trusts management's "Adjusted" metrics far more than the conservative GAAP path assumed here.
2.  **Sustained High Growth:** The market likely believes the core growth drivers (**Miebo, Daily SiHy, enVista recovery**) will sustain **8-10%** revenue growth for much longer (e.g., 5-7 years) before decelerating, whereas the model uses a highly conservative 5.5% down to 3.5% glide path.
3.  **Successful Deleveraging and Lower Risk:** The market likely assumes the spin-off and a portion of the Bausch Health stake sale will significantly reduce the $\mathbf{\$4.9 \text{ billion}}$ debt load in the near future, which would drastically reduce the $\mathbf{\$375 \text{ million}}$ annual interest expense, flowing directly to the bottom line. It also likely uses a **lower Discount Rate** (e.g., 8-9%) than the conservative 10.0% used in this analysis, increasing the NPV of future cash flows.
4.  **Terminal Value/Maturity Rate:** The market is likely using a more aggressive Terminal Growth Rate (g) of $\mathbf{3.0\% - 3.5\%}$, which, when combined with a lower discount rate, greatly inflates the Terminal Value portion of the valuation.

#### **Conclusion of the Conservative Valuation**

The conservative valuation shows that, at the current price, Bausch + Lomb is an **extremely high-risk/high-reward** turnaround play whose success is entirely dependent on:
*   The actualization of management's "financial excellence" to achieve significant and sustainable profit margins above 15% quickly.
*   The effective deleveraging of the balance sheet to cut the high interest expense.
*   Sustaining the organic growth of Miebo and premium Vision Care products to support revenue growth well above the assumed conservative rates.

The market has priced in a near-perfect execution of the Vision '27 strategy and a return to industry-leading margins. This conservative DCF analysis highlights the significant risk premium embedded in the current stock price, driven by the massive debt load and the current low level of GAAP profitability.
