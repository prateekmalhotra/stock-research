The valuation of CVS Group plc (CVSGF) is performed in Great British Pounds (GBP) as the company is primarily listed on the London Stock Exchange (CVSG) and reports its financials in GBP. The valuation will then be converted to USD for the final per-share price comparison.

*All figures are in millions of GBP (£m) unless otherwise noted.*

### **I. Financial Data & Base Assumptions (FY2025)**

The financial data is extracted from the company's latest available Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2025.

| Metric | Value ($\text{\textsterling}$m) | Source/Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price (CVSG)** | £13.82 per share | Closing price as of Oct 25, 2025 (1,382.00 pence) |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 71.74 million | Latest reported shares in issue [cite: 4, 7 (Step 2)] |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $\text{\textsterling}$17.0 | Used 2024 figure as a conservative proxy for the current balance sheet, which excludes accounts receivable and other non-cash assets. [cite: 3 (Step 3)] |
| **Total Debt (Proxy)** | $\text{\textsterling}$131.4 | Used Net Bank Borrowings (which is Gross Bank Debt - Cash) as a conservative proxy for Total Debt. This is less conservative for the final valuation as Net Debt is lower than Gross Debt. [cite: 2, 7 (Step 3)] |
| **Revenue (FY2025)** | $\text{\textsterling}$673.2 | Revenue from continuing operations [cite: 16 (Step 2)] |
| **Net Income (FY2025)** | $\text{\textsterling}$52.8 | Net Income for the year [cite: 15 (Step 3)] |
| **Gross Margin (FY2025)** | 42.44% | Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Gross Margin [cite: 1, 9 (Step 3)] |
| **Net Income Margin (FY2025)** | 7.84% | Net Income / Revenue ($\text{\textsterling}52.8m / \text{\textsterling}673.2m$) [cite: 15 (Step 3)] |
| **Historical ROIC (TTM)** | 6.79% | Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Return on Investment [cite: 9 (Step 3)] |

### **II. Business Engine & Future Assumptions**

CVS Group's business engine is driven by:
1.  **Like-for-Like (LFL) Sales Growth:** Price increases, complexity of care (aging 'COVID-19 cohort' of pets), and their subscription 'Healthy Pet Club'.
2.  **Acquisitions:** Adding new practices, which is a major driver of overall revenue growth.

| Category | Assumption | Rationale & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LFL Growth Rate** | **3.0%** (2026-2030) | Management's medium-term ambition is 4-8% [cite: 6 (Step 3)]. To be conservative, I am using a rate significantly **below** the bottom end of guidance due to the ongoing CMA investigation's negative market sentiment and the soft LFL growth in FY2025 (0.2%) [cite: 16 (Step 2)]. The 3.0% assumes a modest recovery without achieving the full historical potential. |
| **Acquisition Revenue Growth** | **2.0%** (2026-2030) | UK acquisitions are on hold due to the CMA [cite: 14 (Step 2)]. Growth will rely primarily on expansion in Australia (7 acquisitions in FY2025) [cite: 6 (Step 3)] and capital expenditure on existing facilities. A conservative 2.0% growth is a conservative estimate for new practices. |
| **Total Revenue Growth** | **5.0%** (LFL 3.0% + Acquisition 2.0%) | This is a highly conservative combined growth rate, significantly lower than the historical growth, and acts as the base for all revenue forecasts. |
| **Net Income Margin** | **8.0%** (2026) $\to$ **9.0%** (2030) | FY2025 Net Income Margin was 7.84% [cite: 15 (Step 3)]. Management has shown good cost discipline (Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 70bps to 20% in FY2025) [cite: 16 (Step 2)]. I project a modest, conservative 1.16 percentage point expansion over 5 years, reflecting scale benefits and continued cost management. |
| **Future ROIC %** | **5.0%** | The historical TTM ROIC is 6.79% [cite: 9 (Step 3)]. To be conservative, I am using a lower-than-historical **5.0%** ROIC. This ensures the additional income from retained earnings is conservatively estimated. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative rate for a stable, market-leading business in a non-cyclical sector (pet healthcare), but facing regulatory uncertainty (CMA). This is above many large-cap WACCs but appropriate for mid-cap volatility and risk. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth)**| **2.0%** | A conservative rate, reflecting a growth rate slightly above long-term inflation in the UK market. |

### **III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) as per the instruction, with the addition of ROIC from prior-year's accumulated retained earnings.

**A. Projected Income Statement and Cash Flow ($\text{\textsterling}$m)**

| Year (FY Jun 30) | Revenue ($\text{\textsterling}$m) | Growth Rate | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Operations (A) | ROIC on Prior Year Cash (B) | Total FCFE (A) + (B) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of FCFE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | $\text{\textsterling}$673.2 | - | 7.84% | $\text{\textsterling}$52.8 | - | $\text{\textsterling}$52.8 | - | - |
| **2026** | $\text{\textsterling}$706.9 | 5.0% | 8.00% | $\text{\textsterling}$56.6 | $\text{\textsterling}2.6$ | $\text{\textsterling}$59.2 | 0.9174 | $\text{\textsterling}54.3$ |
| **2027** | $\text{\textsterling}$742.2 | 5.0% | 8.25% | $\text{\textsterling}$61.2 | $\text{\textsterling}2.9$ | $\text{\textsterling}$64.1 | 0.8417 | $\text{\textsterling}54.0$ |
| **2028** | $\text{\textsterling}$779.3 | 5.0% | 8.50% | $\text{\textsterling}$66.2 | $\text{\textsterling}3.2$ | $\text{\textsterling}$69.4 | 0.7722 | $\text{\textsterling}53.6$ |
| **2029** | $\text{\textsterling}$818.3 | 5.0% | 8.75% | $\text{\textsterling}$71.6 | $\text{\textsterling}3.5$ | $\text{\textsterling}$75.1 | 0.7084 | $\text{\textsterling}53.2$ |
| **2030** | $\text{\textsterling}$859.2 | 5.0% | 9.00% | $\text{\textsterling}$77.3 | $\text{\textsterling}3.9$ | $\text{\textsterling}$81.2 | 0.6499 | $\text{\textsterling}52.8$ |
| **Total NPV of FCFE (2026-2030)** | | | | | | | | **$\text{\textsterling}267.9$** |

***Calculation Notes:***
*   *Net Income from Operations (A)* = Revenue * Net Income Margin.
*   *ROIC on Prior Year Cash (B)* = Net Income of Previous Year * Conservative ROIC (5.0%).
*   *Total FCFE* = (A) + (B).
*   *NPV of FCFE* = Total FCFE * Discount Factor.

**B. Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   $Terminal FCFE = \text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate}) = \text{\textsterling}81.2m \times (1 + 2.0\%) = \text{\textsterling}82.8m$
*   $TV_{2030} = \text{Terminal FCFE} / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}) = \text{\textsterling}82.8m / (9.0\% - 2.0\%) = \text{\textsterling}1,182.9m$
*   $NPV \text{ of } TV = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \text{\textsterling}1,182.9m \times 0.6499 = \text{\textsterling}768.7m$

**C. Total Equity Value & Fair Value Per Share**

| Metric | Value ($\text{\textsterling}$m) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of FCFE (2026-2030)** | $\text{\textsterling}267.9$ |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | $\text{\textsterling}768.7$ |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $\text{\textsterling}1,036.6$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $\text{\textsterling}17.0$ |
| **Less: Total Debt (Proxy)** | $\text{\textsterling}131.4$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$\text{\textsterling}922.2$** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 71.74 |
| **Fair Value Per Share (GBP)** | **$\text{\textsterling}12.85$** |

### **IV. Fair Value and Conclusion**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (GBP)** | **$\text{\textsterling}12.85$** |
| **Current Stock Price (GBP)** | $\text{\textsterling}13.82$ [cite: 3 (Step 2)] |
| **Implied Market Assumption** | $855p$ higher than Fair Value |

**Conversion to USD (for CVSGF ticker comparison):**
*   Assuming a conservative GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.25.
*   Fair Value Per Share (USD) = $\text{\textsterling}12.85 \times 1.25 = **\$16.06**$
*   Current Stock Price (USD) = $\text{\textsterling}13.82 \times 1.25 \approx **\$17.28**$ (The market price for CVSGF would be close to this value.)

The calculated fair value is **$\text{\textsterling}12.85$ per share**.

### **V. Justification of Difference between Fair Value and Market Value**

The calculated Fair Value of $\text{\textsterling}12.85$ is **7.0% lower** than the current market price of $\text{\textsterling}13.82$.

The market is currently making more **optimistic assumptions** than the conservative projections used in this DCF, specifically regarding two key factors:

1.  **LFL Growth Rate and CMA Resolution:** The market appears to be discounting the long-term impact of the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation and assumes the company will rapidly return to its medium-term LFL growth guidance of 4-8% [cite: 6 (Step 3)] sooner and/or at a higher rate than the conservative 3.0% used here. The market may believe the CMA's provisional remedies will be mild or easily managed, enabling a quicker return to robust UK organic growth.
2.  **Acquisition and Margin Expansion:** The market likely assumes a higher pace of accretive acquisitions in the rapidly growing Australian market, and/or a faster rate of margin expansion. The conservative model projects the Net Income Margin to reach only 9.0% by 2030, whereas the market's price suggests an expected Net Income Margin closer to **10-11%** or a higher terminal growth rate (3.0%+) for a mature, stable business.

**Conclusion:** The conservative valuation model indicates that CVS Group plc is slightly overvalued by the market based on a conservative 5.0% long-term revenue growth and modest margin expansion. The market premium is a bet on the company's ability to successfully navigate the regulatory environment and accelerate both its UK LFL growth and Australian acquisition strategy closer to its own management-guided metrics.
