## Freshpet, Inc. (FRPT) Stock Valuation: Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

The valuation of Freshpet, Inc. (FRPT) will be conducted using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, projecting Net Income as a proxy for unlevered Free Cash Flow for a growth company with significant capital expenditures, and adjusting the final Net Present Value for net debt. All financial figures are in millions of U.S. Dollars, except for per-share data.

### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Freshpet's primary business engine is driven by three key factors: **Household Penetration (HHP)**, **Refrigerated Retail Presence (Freshpet Fridges/ACV)**, and **Buy Rate (ARPU)**.

**Key Management Guidance and Business Drivers:**

1.  **FY 2025 Net Sales Guidance:** Management is guiding for net sales growth of 13% to 16% year-over-year [cite: 8 in step 1]. I will use the conservative end of this range, **13%**.
    *   *Calculation for 2025 Revenue:* \$975.2 * (1 + 0.13) = **\$1,101.0 million**.
2.  **Long-Term Growth:** Management removed the aggressive FY 2027 Net Sales target of \$1.8 billion, citing persistent consumer uncertainty and tempered demand for new trial [cite: 8 in step 1, 8]. This signals a more moderate, realistic long-term growth expectation.
3.  **Conservative Engine Assumption:** FRPT's growth is a function of adding new fridges (ACV expansion) and increasing the purchase frequency/size of existing customers (Buy Rate/HHP). Given the macro uncertainty cited by management, I will adopt a **moderating growth rate** that starts conservatively based on their guidance and then gradually declines toward a sustainable long-term rate.

| Year | Revenue Calculation (Conservative) | Revenue (\$M) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | *Actual* | \$975.2 | Baseline. |
| **FY 2025** | \$975.2 * (1 + 13.0%) | **\$1,101.0** | Uses conservative end of management's 13-16% guidance. [cite: 8 in step 1] |
| **FY 2026** | \$1,101.0 * (1 + 12.0%) | **\$1,233.1** | Moderately stepping down from 2025 guidance, acknowledging the removal of the aggressive 2027 target and reflecting continued, but slowing, penetration and fridge rollout. |
| **FY 2027** | \$1,233.1 * (1 + 10.0%) | **\$1,356.4** | A further moderation as the category matures and growth becomes more dependent on Buy Rate increase over new Household Penetration. |
| **FY 2028** | \$1,356.4 * (1 + 8.0%) | **\$1,464.9** | Moving towards a mid-to-high single-digit growth rate as the company approaches scale. |
| **FY 2029** | \$1,464.9 * (1 + 7.0%) | **\$1,567.4** | Reflects a sustainable, mature premium consumer staples growth rate. |
| **FY 2030** | \$1,567.4 * (1 + 6.0%) | **\$1,661.5** | Final year of projection, close to the long-term terminal growth rate. |

### III. Margin Projections and Net Income (2025-2030)

Management guidance is used as the truth for margin expansion, which is a key part of their investment thesis (Kitchens expansion leading to leverage).

1.  **Gross Margin (GAAP):** FY 2024 GAAP Gross Margin was 40.6%. Management has a goal of **48% Adjusted Gross Margin for FY 2027**. I will project GAAP Gross Margin (GM) to trend towards 45% by 2030, assuming a slight gap to the 48% *Adjusted* target for conservatism.
2.  **Operating Expenses (SG&A):** Management targets a **22% Adjusted EBITDA Margin for FY 2027**. Since Adjusted GM is 48%, Adjusted SG&A (as % of Net Sales) must be 48% - 22% = 26% by 2027. I will project the GAAP SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales (SGA%) to trend conservatively from 36.7% in 2024 towards 32% by 2030.
3.  **Interest & Tax:** Interest Expense is based on the current debt. A conservative tax rate of 25% is used, as the company is now profitable.

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | Gross Margin (%) | Gross Profit (\$M) | SG&A % of Sales | SG&A (\$M) | EBIT (\$M) | Tax (25%) (\$M) | **Net Income (\$M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | \$975.2 | 40.6% | \$396.4 | 36.7% | \$358.0 | \$38.4 | N/A* | **\$46.9** |
| **FY 2025** | \$1,101.0 | 41.5% | \$456.9 | 36.0% | \$396.4 | \$60.5 | \$15.1 | **\$45.4** |
| **FY 2026** | \$1,233.1 | 43.0% | \$530.2 | 35.0% | \$431.6 | \$98.6 | \$24.6 | **\$74.0** |
| **FY 2027** | \$1,356.4 | 44.0% | \$596.8 | 34.0% | \$461.2 | \$135.6 | \$33.9 | **\$101.7** |
| **FY 2028** | \$1,464.9 | 44.5% | \$651.8 | 33.0% | \$483.4 | \$168.4 | \$42.1 | **\$126.3** |
| **FY 2029** | \$1,567.4 | 44.8% | \$702.4 | 32.5% | \$509.4 | \$193.0 | \$48.2 | **\$144.8** |
| **FY 2030** | \$1,661.5 | 45.0% | \$747.7 | 32.0% | \$531.7 | \$216.0 | \$54.0 | **\$162.0** |

*Note: FY 2024 Net Income is the reported GAAP figure, which included a one-time gain on an equity investment, making the Net Income higher than the EBIT.

### IV. Net Income with Reinvested Cash (ROIC)

The valuation model assumes Net Income converts directly to cash, and that cash is reinvested at the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) rate.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** FRPT’s ROIC has been negative in prior unprofitable years. With management guiding toward sustained profitability, a conservative positive ROIC is necessary. A conservative, yet realistic, ROIC for a growing, branded premium consumer staples company is assumed to be **7%**.

| Year | Net Income from Operations (\$M) | Cash Carried Forward from Prior Year (\$M) | ROIC (7%) on Cash (\$M) | **Total Net Income (\$M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | \$45.4 | \$46.9 (From FY 2024) | \$3.3 | **\$48.7** |
| **FY 2026** | \$74.0 | \$48.7 | \$3.4 | **\$77.4** |
| **FY 2027** | \$101.7 | \$77.4 | \$5.4 | **\$107.1** |
| **FY 2028** | \$126.3 | \$107.1 | \$7.5 | **\$133.8** |
| **FY 2029** | \$144.8 | \$133.8 | \$9.4 | **\$154.2** |
| **FY 2030** | \$162.0 | \$154.2 | \$10.8 | **\$172.8** |

### V. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | 9.0% | Conservative, but reasonable, rate for a growth company in the consumer staples sector, reflecting higher risk due to aggressive expansion/capital needs. |
| **Perpetuity Growth Rate (Maturity Rate)** | 2.5% | Very conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above long-term inflation, for a stable, mature consumer staple company. |

| Year | Total Net Income (\$M) (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | \$48.7 | 0.9174 | \$44.7 |
| **FY 2026** | \$77.4 | 0.8417 | \$65.2 |
| **FY 2027** | \$107.1 | 0.7722 | \$82.7 |
| **FY 2028** | \$133.8 | 0.7084 | \$94.8 |
| **FY 2029** | \$154.2 | 0.6499 | \$100.2 |
| **FY 2030** | \$172.8 | 0.5963 | \$103.0 |
| **Terminal Value** | \$172.8 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.09 - 0.025) = \$2,711.0 | 0.5963 | \$1,616.5 |

**Sum of Present Values (Enterprise Value Proxy):** \$44.7 + \$65.2 + \$82.7 + \$94.8 + \$100.2 + \$103.0 + \$1,616.5 = **\$2,107.1 million**

### VI. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (\$M) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value Proxy)** | \$2,107.1 | Sum of discounted cash flows. |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$243.7 | As of June 30, 2025. |
| **Less: Total Debt Outstanding** | (\$396.2) | As of June 30, 2025. |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$1,954.6** | NPV + Cash - Debt |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 48.78 | [cite: 5 in step 1, 7 in step 1, 13 in step 1] |
| **Fair Value per Share** | \$1,954.6 / 48.78 | **\$40.07** |

## Final Valuation Summary and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **\$40.07** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$54.06** |
| **Difference** | **-25.9%** |

### Justification for Difference

The calculated fair value of **\$40.07** is **25.9% lower** than the current market price of **\$54.06**. This significant difference is due to the inherent conservatism in the valuation model and the market's more optimistic assumptions regarding Freshpet's growth and margin expansion.

**The Market's Assumptions (Implied by the higher stock price):**

1.  **More Aggressive Revenue Growth:** The market likely believes Freshpet will significantly *exceed* the conservative 13% growth used for FY 2025 and will maintain a double-digit growth rate much longer than projected in this model (e.g., 15-20% through 2028). The market is pricing in the *potential* for Freshpet to eventually reach or surpass a similar magnitude as their now-removed \$1.8 billion target by 2027, which implies a faster adoption curve for its premium product.
2.  **Higher Terminal Value/Sustained Profitability:** The market likely assumes a higher long-term operating margin (Net Income margin) and/or a higher perpetuity growth rate. The market is giving management the benefit of the doubt on hitting the **22% Adjusted EBITDA margin** target for 2027 and is projecting a sustained GAAP net income margin much higher than the 9.75% achieved in 2030 in this conservative model (EBIT/Revenue of 13.0% in 2030).
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** Given FRPT's high growth potential in a recession-resilient industry (pet care), the market may be applying a lower required rate of return (e.g., 7.5% - 8.0%), which significantly increases the present value of future cash flows.
4.  **Free Cash Flow Positive in 2026:** Management has stated a goal to be free cash flow positive in 2026 [cite: 19 in step 1]. The market is rewarding the transition from a capital-intensive growth phase to a cash-generative phase earlier and more significantly than our model's conservative Net Income proxy, which may underestimate the operating cash flow generation once major Kitchens capex is behind them.

**Justification for Conservative Model:**

The conservative assumptions are warranted for a company with a history of *negative* net income that has only recently guided to sustained profitability.

1.  **Revenue Deceleration:** Management themselves removed the aggressive \$1.8 billion revenue target due to "uncertainty about future category growth and consumer spending patterns". The model’s step-down in growth (from 13% to 6%) is a direct, conservative response to this explicit management caution.
2.  **Capital Intensity:** Freshpet remains highly capital-intensive, as seen by the need for Kitchens expansion [cite: 20 in step 1]. The use of Net Income (which is post-depreciation but before capex in this simplified model) is a proxy for cash flow. If future capital expenditures remain high to fund the 6-10% revenue growth, the *true* Free Cash Flow could be significantly lower than Net Income, further justifying the conservative fair value.
3.  **ROIC:** The use of a relatively modest **7% ROIC** reflects the risk that the massive capital investments in the "Freshpet Kitchens" [cite: 20 in step 1] may not generate super-normal returns immediately upon deployment.

**Conclusion:** The market is betting on a faster, longer, and more profitable execution of the company's growth strategy than is prudent for a conservative fundamental valuation. The **\$40.07** fair value is a more realistic estimate of intrinsic value, suggesting the stock is currently overvalued by the market's high expectations for immediate, flawless execution on margin expansion and sustained double-digit revenue growth.
