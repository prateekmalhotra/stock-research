## Freshpet, Inc. (FRPT) Valuation

### 1. Initial Financial Data (From SEC Filings)

The initial financial data is sourced from Freshpet's most recent SEC filings, primarily the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Q3 2025 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $274.6 | As of September 30, 2025 (Q3 2025 10-Q) |
| **Total Debt** | $396.8 | As of September 30, 2025 (Convertible senior notes outstanding) |
| **FY 2024 Net Sales** | $975.2 | Full Year Ended December 31, 2024 |
| **FY 2024 Net Income** | $46.9 | Full Year Ended December 31, 2024 (First full-year profit) |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | 50.2 Million | Used conservative diluted shares (approx. from Q2 2025 10-Q) |
| **Current Stock Price** | ~$69.90 | As of February 6, 2026 |

### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

The core of Freshpet's business engine is its refrigerated product distribution and increasing household penetration (HH) in the United States.

| Year | Growth Rate Justification | Revenue Growth Rate | Net Sales (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | *Actual* | 27.2% | $975.2 |
| **2025** | Management's updated guidance of ~13% growth from 2024. | 13.0% | $1,101.9 |
| **2026** | **Conservative extrapolation of key driver:** Management is targeting 20 million households by 2027, up from 13.5 million in 2024, implying a 14.2% CAGR on the penetration driver. Using a slightly more conservative rate. | 13.0% | $1,245.1 |
| **2027** | *Continuation of conservative key driver:* This rate gets close to the 20M HH target's implied growth. | 13.0% | $1,407.0 |
| **2028** | **Conservative Tapering:** The company has removed its aggressive $1.8B 2027 net sales target due to slower growth. Growth must be tapered to reflect maturity and increasing size. | 10.0% | $1,547.7 |
| **2029** | Tapering continues to a more sustainable, high single-digit growth. | 8.0% | $1,671.5 |
| **2030** | Tapering towards the perpetuity growth rate. | 6.0% | $1,772.8 |

**Justification of Revenue Projections:** The projections are conservative. They are backed by the core business driver (Household Penetration) but use a growth rate slightly below the **14.2% CAGR** implied by the 20M HH goal for the 2024-2027 period, and then a strong taper is applied post-2027, recognizing the lower-than-expected current growth that led to the removal of the $1.8B 2027 goal.

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

The projection for profitability is based on management's reaffirmed 2027 margin targets, using a conservative conversion to Net Income.

| Year | Net Sales (A) | Net Income Margin % Justification | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A * B) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $975.2 | *Actual GAAP* | 4.81% | $46.9 |
| **2025** | $1,101.9 | Gradual progression from 2024 actual toward 2027 target. | 7.0% | $77.1 |
| **2026** | $1,245.1 | Management guides for FCF-positive in 2026, implying improved profitability. | 9.0% | $112.1 |
| **2027** | $1,407.0 | **Target Year:** Management's 2027 Adjusted EBITDA Margin target is 22%. A **12.0%** Net Income Margin is a conservative estimate, assuming post-EBITDA costs (D&A, Interest, Tax) total 10.0% (vs. ~11.8% in 2024). | 12.0% | $168.8 |
| **2028** | $1,547.7 | Continued operating leverage/tax efficiency. | 13.0% | $201.2 |
| **2029** | $1,671.5 | Approaching a long-term stable margin for a premium consumer goods business. | 14.0% | $234.0 |
| **2030** | $1,772.8 | Stable long-term margin. | 14.5% | $257.1 |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The model assumes that Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year (per instruction). The calculation uses the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) model to get additional income.

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** 9.0%
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** 2.5%
*   **Conservative ROIC (for incremental income):** 5.0% (Since historical ROIC may be volatile or negative due to heavy CapEx, a conservative positive 5.0% is used, as per instructions).

**DCF Table (USD Millions)**

| Year | Net Income (NI) (A) | Previous Year's Cash (B) | Incremental ROIC Income (B * 5.0%) (C) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) (D) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (D * Discount Factor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $77.1 | $46.9 | $2.3 | $79.4 | 0.9174 | $72.8 |
| **2026** | $112.1 | $79.4 | $4.0 | $116.1 | 0.8417 | $97.7 |
| **2027** | $168.8 | $116.1 | $5.8 | $174.6 | 0.7722 | $134.8 |
| **2028** | $201.2 | $174.6 | $8.7 | $209.9 | 0.7084 | $148.7 |
| **2029** | $234.0 | $209.9 | $10.5 | $244.5 | 0.6499 | $158.9 |
| **2030** | $257.1 | $244.5 | $12.2 | $269.3 | 0.5963 | $160.6 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | | | | **$773.5** |

### 5. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the value of all cash flows after the projection period (2030).

**Terminal Cash Flow (2031):**
*   2030 Net Income: $257.1M
*   2030 Ending Cash (for ROIC): $269.3M
*   2031 Base Net Income (2030 NI * (1 + g)): $257.1M * (1 + 2.5%) = $263.5M
*   2031 Incremental ROIC: $269.3M * 5.0% = $13.5M
*   **Terminal Cash Flow (2031):** $263.5M + $13.5M = **$277.0 Million**

**Terminal Value (at end of 2030):**
*   Terminal Value = Cash Flow (2031) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   Terminal Value = $277.0M / (9.0% - 2.5%) = $277.0M / 0.065 = **$4,261.5 Million**

**NPV of Terminal Value (Today):**
*   NPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (2030)
*   NPV of Terminal Value = $4,261.5M * 0.5963 = **$2,541.2 Million**

### 6. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | $773.5 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | $2,541.2 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$3,314.7** |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $274.6 |
| Less: Total Debt | ($396.8) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$3,192.5 Million** |
| Divide by: Diluted Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 50.2 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$63.59** |

## Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: $63.59**

**Current Market Price (Approx.): $69.90**

My calculated fair value of **$63.59** is approximately 8.9% lower than the current market price of $69.90. This suggests the stock is slightly overvalued based on my very conservative DCF assumptions.

### Justification for the Difference

The market value of FRPT's stock is based on assumptions that are slightly more optimistic than the conservative estimates used in this DCF model.

1.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate (g):**
    *   My model uses a highly conservative **2.5%** perpetual growth rate. The market likely prices in a much higher long-term growth rate, perhaps 3.0%-4.0%, given Freshpet's position as a category creator with significant market runway (only 13.5M HH penetrated toward a much larger potential market). An increase in **g** to 3.5% would significantly increase the terminal value and fair value.

2.  **Higher ROIC:**
    *   My model uses a low and conservative **5.0% ROIC** for incremental income. Given the company's strong brand loyalty, high growth rates, and manufacturing efficiency (99.1% owned product volume in 2024), the market is likely factoring in a much higher ROIC, reflecting superior capital allocation in a premium market. A higher ROIC dramatically increases the "additional income" generated from retained earnings.

3.  **Faster Margin Expansion (Lower Post-EBITDA Costs):**
    *   My model conservatively assumes Post-EBITDA costs (D&A, Interest, Tax) as a high percentage of revenue. The market may assume a much more rapid achievement of operating leverage, leading to a Net Income Margin closer to the maximum potential implied by the 22% Adjusted EBITDA target (e.g., 15-18% instead of my 14.5% ultimate margin). This would increase all Net Income projections.

**Conclusion:** The market is making a reasonable assumption that Freshpet, Inc. will execute on its long-term growth plan with slightly higher efficiency and sustain a higher perpetual growth rate than the very conservative figures used in this intrinsic valuation. The difference is relatively small, indicating that the market is mostly in line with management's public targets, though it is pricing in a slightly greater expectation of long-term value creation.
