### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for YUMC's revenue growth is driven by a two-pronged strategy: **Aggressive New Store Openings** and **Improved Same-Store Sales (SSS) through Value and Digitalization**, which is fueled by an increasingly capital-efficient **Franchising Model**.

*   **Initial Store Count (EOP 2024):** 16,395 restaurants.
*   **Long-Term Store Target:** Management has a stated goal to reach **20,000 stores by 2026**. This is a key internal metric that provides a strong floor for growth projections.
*   **New Store Opening Guidance (2025):** 1,600 to 1,800 net new stores. **(Midpoint: 1,700)**.
*   **2025 System Sales Growth Guidance:** Mid-single-digit (4-6%). **(Conservative Estimate: 4.0%)**.
*   **Same-Store Sales (SSS) Assumption:** Given the challenging and value-focused consumer environment in China, and YUMC's strategy to prioritize transaction growth over ticket average (leading to lower average checks), the safest and most conservative assumption is:
    *   **Same-Store Sales Growth (SSS):** **0.0%** for the entire projection period (2025-2030). This assumes all revenue growth is driven by new unit expansion.

| Year | Beginning Stores | New Stores (Conservative Estimate) | New Store % Growth | Revenue Growth Assumption | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | 16,395 | 1,751 | 11.5% | N/A | \$11,300 |
| **2025** | 16,395 | 1,700 | 10.4% | **4.0%** (Management Guidance) | **\$11,752** |
| **2026** | 18,095 | 1,705 | 9.4% | **5.0%** (Growth from 20K target) | **\$12,340** |
| **2027** | 19,800 | 1,700 | 8.6% | **4.5%** | **\$12,895** |
| **2028** | 21,500 | 1,500 | 7.0% | **3.5%** | **\$13,346** |
| **2029** | 23,000 | 1,400 | 6.1% | **3.0%** | **\$13,746** |
| **2030** | 24,400 | 1,200 | 4.9% | **2.5%** | **\$14,089** |

*Revenue Rationale:* The store growth rate is front-loaded to reflect the management's ambitious target of 20,000 stores by 2026 (requiring 1,700+ openings in 2025/2026) and then conservatively slows down over the projection period as the market matures and unit economics become more challenging. Revenue growth is set at the guidance floor (4%) for 2025 and is tied to, but generally slightly lower than, the store growth percentage to reflect the conservative assumption of 0.0% SSS.

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

*   **Base Net Income Margin (2024):** \$911M / \$11,300M = **8.06%**.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** YUMC is shifting towards a franchise model (franchise mix of new stores increasing to 40-50% for KFC and 20-30% for Pizza Hut) which is highly capital-efficient and expected to improve profitability over the mid- to long-term. Based on this, a conservative but positive **ROIC of 10.0%** is used for cash accumulation.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) | ROIC on Prior Year's Cash (C) | Projected Net Income (B+C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | \$11,300 | 8.06% | \$911 | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | \$11,752 | 8.0% | \$940 | \$91.1 (from \$911M) | **\$1,031** |
| **2026** | \$12,340 | 8.1% | \$1,000 | \$194.2 (from \$1,031M + \$911M) | **\$1,194** |
| **2027** | \$12,895 | 8.2% | \$1,057 | \$313.6 (from \$1,194M + \$1,031M + \$911M) | **\$1,371** |
| **2028** | \$13,346 | 8.3% | \$1,108 | \$450.7 | **\$1,559** |
| **2029** | \$13,746 | 8.4% | \$1,155 | \$606.6 | **\$1,761** |
| **2030** | \$14,089 | 8.5% | \$1,198 | \$782.8 | **\$1,981** |

*Margin Rationale:* Net Income margin is conservatively held near the 2024 level of 8.06%, with a gradual 10 basis point increase per year to reflect the management's commentary on stable-to-improving core OP margin and enhanced profitability over the long-term, driven by operational efficiencies, Project Fresh Eye, and the more capital-light franchising model.

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

For this analysis, Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF), as the capital-light franchise/mini-store model offsets CapEx, and the company is a mature, high-growth entity in China.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **8.0%**. A conservative rate reflecting the unique, elevated risk profile of a US-listed company with all operations in China.
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** **2.5%**. This is a very conservative rate for a mature, large-scale company that will have exhausted its high-growth phase. This is well below the expected GDP growth rate of China and reflects a cautious, conservative approach.

#### Discounted Cash Flow Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow (Projected Net Income) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1,031 | 0.9259 | \$955 |
| **2026** | \$1,194 | 0.8573 | \$1,024 |
| **2027** | \$1,371 | 0.7938 | \$1,088 |
| **2028** | \$1,559 | 0.7350 | \$1,146 |
| **2029** | \$1,761 | 0.6806 | \$1,199 |
| **2030** | \$1,981 | 0.6302 | \$1,248 |
| **Total NPV of Project Period Cash Flow** | | | **\$6,660** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation (TV)

*   **Terminal Cash Flow (TCF):** \$1,981 million (2030 Projected Net Income)
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** $\text{TCF} \times \frac{(1 + \text{g})}{(\text{WACC} - \text{g})} = \$1,981 \times \frac{(1 + 0.025)}{(0.080 - 0.025)} = \$37,133$ million
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (2030):** $\text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$37,133 \times 0.6302$ = **\$23,403 million**

#### Total Equity Value

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Project Period Cash Flow** | \$6,660 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | \$23,403 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **\$30,063** |
| **Add: Net Cash** | \$1,448 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$31,511** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$31,511,000,000}{373,323,567} = \mathbf{\$84.41}$$

---

## Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Price | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$84.41** | **\$44.80** | **+88.4%** |

### Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Price

The calculated fair value of **\$84.41** is an **88.4% premium** over the current market price of \$44.80. This significant difference suggests that the market is making far more conservative assumptions about YUMC's future growth and/or carries a higher risk premium for its operations in China.

The market's current assumptions, compared to the model's assumptions, are likely:

1.  **Lower Long-Term Growth Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** The market is likely pricing in a near-zero or even negative long-term growth rate for YUMC, rather than the model's conservative 2.5%. If the market assumed a 0.0% perpetual growth rate and a 10.0% WACC, the Total Equity Value would drop to approximately \$16.8 billion, resulting in a per-share value of $\mathbf{\$45.00}$, almost perfectly aligning with the current market price.
    *   *Conclusion:* The market is essentially pricing YUMC as a **zero-growth mature business** (Terminal Value $\approx 10 \times \text{TCF}$) after 2030.

2.  **Higher Discount Rate (WACC):** The market may be using a significantly higher WACC (e.g., 10-12%) to reflect the escalating geopolitical risks and the specific regulatory/macro-economic headwinds in the Chinese consumer environment (deflationary pressure, value-focused consumers). A higher discount rate heavily penalizes future cash flows.

3.  **Lower Margin and Store Growth:** The market may not fully trust YUMC's ability to execute its ambitious store expansion plan of reaching **20,000 stores by 2026** and believes the new, lower-ticket models (e.g., Pizza Hut WOW) will cannibalize existing store sales, leading to negative Same-Store Sales (SSS) and pressuring the Net Income Margin down from the 8.0% starting point.

**The Case for the Model's Higher Fair Value:**

The model's higher fair value is justified by the strong management-guided operational engine, which the market appears to be ignoring:

*   **Conservative Margin is Already Low:** The model uses a conservative 8.0% Net Income Margin with a minimal increase, which accounts for the difficult operating environment.
*   **Business is Fundamentally Changing (Capital Efficiency):** The strategic shift to a franchise-led, lower-CapEx expansion model (new store franchise mix increasing to 40-50% for KFC and 20-30% for Pizza Hut) ensures that the high store growth is achieved with high returns, justifying the 10.0% ROIC assumption.
*   **Massive Addressable Market:** Management's continued confidence in its **1,600 to 1,800 new stores per year** guidance and expansion into lower-tier cities is the main growth engine that the market is currently not fully pricing in. The model's 2.5% perpetual growth rate is a conservative reflection of the sheer size of the unpenetrated Chinese market and YUMC's dominant position.

**The Fair Value of \$84.41 implies that the market is underestimating YUMC's ability to maintain capital-efficient growth and overcome macro headwinds, pricing the company for a future of zero perpetual growth despite its clear path for expansion within China.**
