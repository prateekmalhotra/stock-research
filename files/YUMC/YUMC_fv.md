### II. Business Engine & Revenue Projection Justification (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Yum China is **New Unit Expansion** and, secondarily, **Same-Store Sales (SSS)** growth, heavily reliant on a **Value-for-Money** strategy in a competitive Chinese consumer market.

| Driver | 2025 Assumption | 2026-2030 Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net New Stores** | 1,700 stores | 1,600 stores/year | Management guided to 1,600–1,800 net new stores in 2025 and a target of 20,000 total stores by 2026. We use the midpoint of **1,700** for 2025. For **2026-2030**, we use a conservative and slightly declining **1,600** new stores annually, reflecting the Law of Large Numbers. |
| **Same-Store Sales (SSS)** | 1.0% | 1.0% (KFC), 0.5% (Pizza Hut/Others) | Management noted that SSS growth is driven by massive **transaction growth** (traffic) but offset by a **decline in average ticket** due to their value-for-money, mass-market focus. We assume a conservative blended SSS growth of **1.0%** for KFC and **0.5%** for Pizza Hut/Other to reflect the continued competitive pricing environment and conservative consumer spending in China. |
| **Implied Revenue Growth Rate** | $\approx 9.5\%$ | $\approx 8.0\%$ | Based on a formula: New Unit Growth ($\approx 10\%$) + Same Store Sales ($\approx 1\%$). This is a conservative approach compared to historical performance, assuming a slowdown from the management's aggressive 2026 store target. |

**Revenue Base Year (2024):** Revenue was **$11.303$ billion**.

| Year | Total Revenue (Millions USD) | New Store Growth % (Approx.) | SSS Growth % (Approx.) | Blended Growth % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $11,303 | -- | -- | -- |
| **2025 (Projected)** | $12,382 | 9.5% | 1.0% | 9.5% |
| **2026 (Projected)** | $13,425 | 7.5% | 1.0% | 8.4% |
| **2027 (Projected)** | $14,489 | 6.5% | 1.0% | 7.9% |
| **2028 (Projected)** | $15,588 | 5.5% | 1.0% | 7.6% |
| **2029 (Projected)** | $16,730 | 4.5% | 1.0% | 7.3% |
| **2030 (Projected)** | $17,921 | 3.5% | 1.0% | 7.1% |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection

**Margin Assumptions:**

Management guided to **stable or slightly improved Core Operating Profit (OP) Margin** in 2025, with continued efficiency offsetting wage inflation.

*   **2024 Net Income Margin (Actual):** $\frac{\$911M \text{ Net Income}}{\$11,303M \text{ Revenue}} \approx \mathbf{8.06\%}$.
*   **Projected Net Income Margin:** We assume a gradual, conservative improvement to reflect scale benefits, but acknowledge the continuous pressure on SSS (low average ticket) which caps margin expansion.

| Year | Projected Net Income Margin % | Net Income (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 8.10% | $1,003$ |
| **2026** | 8.20% | $1,101$ |
| **2027** | 8.30% | $1,203$ |
| **2028** | 8.40% | $1,310$ |
| **2029** | 8.50% | $1,422$ |
| **2030** | 8.60% | $1,541$ |

**Reinvestment Income (ROIC Model):**

The rule states: *Net Income (Next Year) = Net Income (Projected) + ROIC * Net Income (Previous Year)*

*   **ROIC Assumption:** We assume a conservative and reasonable **ROIC of 10%**. This reflects the company's capital-light, dominant market position in China and its significant cash-generating capability, while being conservative against potential market volatility.
*   **Net Income for DCF (The "Cash Flow"):** This is the projected Net Income plus the return on accumulated cash from the previous year.

| Year | Projected Net Income | + ROIC (10%) on Prior Year Net Income | = Cash Flow for DCF (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,003 | $911 * 10\% = 91$ | $\mathbf{1,094}$ |
| **2026** | $1,101 | $1,003 * 10\% = 100$ | $\mathbf{1,201}$ |
| **2027** | $1,203 | $1,101 * 10\% = 110$ | $\mathbf{1,313}$ |
| **2028** | $1,310 | $1,203 * 10\% = 120$ | $\mathbf{1,430}$ |
| **2029** | $1,422 | $1,310 * 10\% = 131$ | $\mathbf{1,553}$ |
| **2030** | $1,541 | $1,422 * 10\% = 142$ | $\mathbf{1,683}$ |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

**Conservative Assumptions:**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** We assume a conservative long-term growth rate of **2.0%**. This is justified by China's slowing but still growing economy, and YUMC's continued new store expansion potential in lower-tier cities, which will slow down post-2030.
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (Cost of Equity/Capital):** We assume a conservative, reasonable discount rate of **9.0%**. This reflects a moderate risk profile for a market leader in a volatile, but high-growth, emerging market (China).

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (End of 2030):**

TV = $\frac{\text{Cash Flow for 2030} * (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$

TV = $\frac{\$1,683M * (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02}$

TV = $\frac{\$1,716.66M}{0.07} = \mathbf{\$24,523.71 \text{ million}}$

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

The NPV of the yearly cash flows and the Terminal Value is calculated by discounting back to the present (Year 0).

| Year (t) | Cash Flow for DCF (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.09) ^ t) | Net Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | $1,094 | 0.9174 | $1,003.88 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | $1,201 | 0.8417 | $1,010.87 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | $1,313 | 0.7722 | $1,013.90 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | $1,430 | 0.7084 | $1,013.01 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | $1,553 | 0.6499 | $1,009.28 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | $1,683 + \$24,523.71$ (TV) | 0.5963 | $15,627.18$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | $\mathbf{\$19,678.12 \text{ million}}$ |

---

### V. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value of Equity** = Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Liquid Assets - Total Debt

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $19,678.12$ |
| **+ Total Liquid Assets** | $3,349.00$ |
| **- Total Debt** | $(549.00)$ |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | $\mathbf{\$22,478.12 \text{ million}}$ |

**Fair Value Per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding

Fair Value Per Share = $\frac{\$22,478.12 \text{ million}}{373.32 \text{ million shares}}$

Fair Value Per Share = **\$60.21**

---

### VI. Conclusion and Justification of Market Discrepancy

**Fair Value Per Share: \$60.21**

**Current Market Value (Assumed):** $\approx \$50.00 - \$55.00$

The calculated Fair Value of **\$60.21** is approximately **10% to 20% higher** than the current market price (assuming a current price in the \$50-55 range).

**Justification for Discrepancy:**

The market is currently pricing YUMC more conservatively than my DCF model, likely due to a greater emphasis on the following headwinds:

1.  **Macroeconomic and Competitive Pressure in China (SSS Headwind):** While my model assumes a small positive SSS growth (1.0% to 0.5%), the market is heavily discounting the stock based on persistent concerns over China's economy. The management's strategy of pushing a "value" menu, which results in a significantly lower average ticket price despite increased transactions, confirms the cautious consumer environment. The market may be assuming **0% SSS growth** or even a **modest negative SSS** for the first few years of the projection, or a much slower long-term recovery, which would dramatically lower the total NPV.
2.  **Execution Risk on Store Expansion:** The expansion from 16,395 stores (end of 2024) to 20,000 by 2026 and beyond (over 1,600 stores per year) is a massive undertaking. The market may be applying a higher discount rate (higher risk) to the cash flows due to the execution risk and potential for lower average store revenue or lower margin returns on the new, smaller format stores in lower-tier cities.
3.  **Capital Return vs. Investment:** The company is committing to return substantial capital ($4.5B from 2024 to 2026). While this indicates a strong cash position, it also suggests fewer immediate, high-return internal investment opportunities beyond store expansion. The market might be signaling a higher required return on equity (a higher Discount Rate) due to this capital return policy.

**Why my assumption is different:**

My valuation's higher fair value is primarily driven by:

1.  **Confidence in the Store Expansion Engine:** I have taken management's guidance of 1,600+ new stores per year as the core of the growth engine and only conservatively faded this rate, believing the dominant market position allows this expansion.
2.  **The ROIC Model:** The 10% ROIC on accumulating net income is a strong contributor to the net income projections. This assumes the company efficiently reinvests its retained earnings (not paid as dividends) into the business to achieve incremental returns, which is a powerful compounding factor.
3.  **Positive, Albeit Slow, SSS Growth:** I assume the focus on traffic through the value-for-money strategy is a defensive move that still yields positive revenue growth, unlike a model that assumes a recessionary decline in same-store sales.
