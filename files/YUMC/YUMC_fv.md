## 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The business engine for Yum China is driven by two primary factors: **aggressive net new store unit expansion** and **same-store sales (SSS) growth/traffic increases** in a competitive and maturing Chinese market.

### **Revenue Projection Engine Justification**

Yum China is the largest restaurant company in China and is accelerating its store expansion to reach a long-term goal of 20,000 stores or more. Management has guided for a mid-single-digit system sales growth for 2025.

| Metric | 2024 Actual | 2025 Projection | 2026 Projection | 2027 Projection | 2028 Projection | 2029 Projection | 2030 Projection |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Start Store Count** | 16,395 | 16,395 | 18,095 | 19,795 | 21,295 | 22,595 | 23,695 |
| **Net New Stores** | 1,751 | 1,700 | 1,700 | 1,500 | 1,300 | 1,100 | 1,000 |
| **Net New Unit Contribution**| ~5.0% | ~5.0% | ~4.7% | ~3.9% | ~3.2% | ~2.6% | ~2.2% |
| **Same-Store Sales (SSS)** | ~0.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 0.8% |
| **Total System Sales Growth (ex-FX)** | 5.0% | 6.0% | 5.7% | 4.9% | 4.2% | 3.6% | 3.0% |
| **Revenue Growth** | 3.0% | **5.5%** | **5.0%** | **4.5%** | **4.0%** | **3.5%** | **3.0%** |

*   **Net New Stores:** The 2025 projection of **1,700** is the upper end of the revised management guidance (1,600 to 1,800 or raised to 1,700) for the year. The projection then conservatively decelerates the net new store openings to **1,000** by 2030, reflecting the increasing size of the base and a cautious view on long-term expansion pace, despite the 20,000-store goal.
*   **Same-Store Sales (SSS):** A conservative long-term SSS assumption of **1.0%** is used. While the company is driving traffic (transactions were up 4% in Q4 2024), the strategy for Pizza Hut is to become a "mass-market brand," leading to lower ticket averages, which offsets the traffic gains and keeps SSS low. This assumption is conservative and reflects the current trend of low SSS growth (Q2 2025 SSS was 1%).
*   **Revenue Growth:** A conservative initial 5.5% (mid-single-digit guidance) is used, decelerating annually by 0.5% to reflect competitive pressure and a slowing macro-economic environment in China, despite the robust unit growth.

### **Margin Projection and Net Income Assumptions**

| Metric | 2024 Actual | 2025 Projection | 2026 Projection | 2027 Projection | 2028 Projection | 2029 Projection | 2030 Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 8.06% | 8.20% | 8.35% | 8.50% | 8.65% | 8.80% | 8.90% |
| **ROIC on Prior Year Cash (%)** | N/A | 10.0% | 10.0% | 9.5% | 9.0% | 8.5% | 8.0% |

*   **Net Income Margin:** The 2024 net income margin was 8.06% ($\$$911M / $\$$11,300M). Management commentary indicates steady margin improvement due to improved operational efficiencies, better cost of sales management, and sales leveraging. The margin is projected to conservatively increase by 15-20 basis points annually, reflecting the company's scale and technology investment benefits, reaching 8.90% by 2030.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Yum China has virtually no debt and is a highly capital-efficient business. A **conservative starting ROIC of 10.0%** is assumed for the re-investment of the previous year's net income/retained cash. This is a reasonable baseline for a market leader's new unit investments, given their proven ability to generate profits. The rate is then conservatively lowered to **8.0%** by 2030 to reflect potential maturity and higher reinvestment needs.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### **Cash Flow (Net Income) Projection**

We use **Net Income** as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) since the company has minimal debt, a major source of CAPEX is covered by the operating activities, and the cash position is already substantial.

$$
\text{Projected Net Income}_t = (\text{Revenue}_t \times \text{Net Income Margin}_t) + (\text{Net Income}_{t-1} \times \text{ROIC}_t)
$$

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Revenue ($M) | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income ($M) | ROIC Income ($M) | **Total Net Income ($M)** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2024 (Actual)**| 3.0% | 11,300 | 8.06% | 911 | N/A | 911 |
| **2025** | 5.5% | 11,922 | 8.20% | 977.6 | $911 \times 10.0\% = 91.1$ | **1,068.7** |
| **2026** | 5.0% | 12,518 | 8.35% | 1,044.8 | $1,069 \times 10.0\% = 106.9$ | **1,151.7** |
| **2027** | 4.5% | 13,081 | 8.50% | 1,111.9 | $1,152 \times 9.5\% = 109.4$ | **1,221.3** |
| **2028** | 4.0% | 13,604 | 8.65% | 1,176.7 | $1,221 \times 9.0\% = 109.9$ | **1,286.6** |
| **2029** | 3.5% | 14,080 | 8.80% | 1,239.0 | $1,287 \times 8.5\% = 109.4$ | **1,348.4** |
| **2030** | 3.0% | 14,502 | 8.90% | 1,290.7 | $1,348 \times 8.0\% = 107.9$ | **1,398.6** |

### **Discount Rate and Terminal Value**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable): 9.0%**
    *   This is a conservative rate for a stable, market-leading company with low business risk (food service) but high sovereign/geo-political risk (China market). This rate is higher than many mature U.S. consumer defensive companies, appropriately accounting for the China-specific risks.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative): 1.5%**
    *   This conservative perpetual growth rate is below China's long-term GDP growth potential, reflecting ultimate saturation and competition.

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$1,398.6 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.090 - 0.015} = \frac{\$1,419.6}{\text{0.075}} = \text{\$18,928.0 million}
$$

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

$$
\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{6} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^t} + \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^6}
$$

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income ($M) | Discount Factor $\text{(1/1.09)}^t$ | Present Value ($M) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025 (t=1)**| 1,068.7 | 0.9174 | 980.6 |
| **2026 (t=2)**| 1,151.7 | 0.8417 | 969.4 |
| **2027 (t=3)**| 1,221.3 | 0.7722 | 942.9 |
| **2028 (t=4)**| 1,286.6 | 0.7084 | 911.5 |
| **2029 (t=5)**| 1,348.4 | 0.6499 | 876.3 |
| **2030 (t=6)**| 1,398.6 | 0.5963 | 833.8 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | 18,928.0 | 0.5963 | 11,291.6 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$16,806.1** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

| Metric | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :---: |
| NPV of Future Cash Flows | $16,806.1$ |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $3,155.0$ |
| Less: Total Debt | $0.0$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$19,961.1** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 389.9 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$51.20** |

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Value | Difference |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$51.20** | **~$44.90** | **+14.03%** |

### **Justification for Discrepancy (Valuation > Market Price)**

The calculated Fair Value of **$51.20** is approximately **14% higher** than the current market price of ~$44.90, suggesting the stock is undervalued based on the conservative and management-guided assumptions.

**Why the Market May Be Lower (Market Assumptions):**

The market is likely applying a higher discount rate and/or a more conservative growth/margin profile due to elevated risk perceptions:

1.  **China Macro-Economic and Geopolitical Risk (Higher Discount Rate):** Despite YUMC's strong performance, the market often applies a significant "China discount" due to regulatory uncertainty, heightened geopolitical tensions, and an overall slowing domestic economy. A discount rate of $\mathbf{10\% - 11\%}$ (vs. our 9.0%) would be common for this risk profile, which would dramatically lower the NPV.
2.  **Margin Compression from Competition (Lower Margins):** The low same-store sales and the aggressive price-to-volume strategy (lower ticket average for Pizza Hut) suggest intense competition. The market may assume that YUMC cannot sustain the projected annual margin expansion (8.20% to 8.90%) and may expect margins to remain flat or even decline slightly, fearing a "race to the bottom" on price.
3.  **Capital Allocation and ROIC Concern (Lower ROIC):** While YUMC is debt-free and growing, the CAPEX required for the ambitious new unit expansion is substantial. The market may be skeptical that the company can achieve a long-term ROIC of 8.0% to 10.0% on this capital, as new stores may cannibalize existing sales and take longer to reach maturity in lower-tier cities.

**Justification for the Valuation (Why the Market is Under-Priced):**

Our model's higher valuation is justified by:

1.  **Debt-Free Capital Structure:** The $\$$0 Total Debt significantly lowers the risk and increases the final equity value per share.
2.  **Management-Guided Growth Engine:** The revenue projections are strictly based on management's stated target for 2025 net new stores and "mid-single-digit" system sales growth and a long-term store count target. The model conservatively slows this growth down over time.
3.  **Conservative ROIC/Maturity Rates:** The 9.0% discount rate is already on the high end, and the 1.5% perpetual growth rate is very conservative for a dominant market leader still in a major expansion phase. If we used a long-term growth rate closer to China's nominal GDP target (e.g., 2.5%), the valuation would be significantly higher.
4.  **Proof of Operational Excellence:** The company has demonstrated margin expansion even while navigating the competitive environment (e.g., Q2 2025 OP margin up 100 basis points), which supports the projected gradual increase in Net Income Margin.

**Conclusion:** Our valuation suggests that the market is over-discounting the geopolitical and macro-economic risks, failing to fully credit YUMC's operational efficiency, debt-free balance sheet, and its powerful, management-guided unit expansion engine. **The stock is undervalued by approximately 14% based on a conservative DCF model.**
