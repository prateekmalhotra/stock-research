## **II. Business Engine and Conservative Future Assumptions**

Yum China's core business engine is driven by two primary factors:
1.  **Massive New Store Expansion:** Aggressive roll-out of new units, particularly in lower-tier cities.
2.  **Same-Store Sales Growth (SSSG) & Digital Penetration:** Driving transaction volume via delivery, digital membership, and value promotions.

### **A. Revenue Projections (2025–2030)**

The revenue is projected by separating the company's two key growth drivers: **New Unit Growth** and **Same-Store Sales Growth (SSSG)**.

| Year | Total Stores (EOY) | New Unit Contribution (Growth Rate) | SSSG Contribution (Growth Rate) | Total Revenue Growth Rate (Conservative) | Projected Revenue (\$Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Actual) | 16,395 | - | - | - | **\$11,303** |
| **2025** (Guidance) | 18,095 | $\approx 10.4\%$ (1,700 net new stores) | $\approx -5.4\%$ | **5.0%** (Mid-single-digit guidance) | **\$11,868** |
| **2026** (Conservative) | 19,595 | $\approx 8.3\%$ (1,500 net new stores) | $\approx -3.3\%$ | **5.0%** | **\$12,461** |
| **2027** | 20,895 | $\approx 6.6\%$ (1,300 net new stores) | $\approx -2.6\%$ | **4.0%** | **\$12,959** |
| **2028** | 22,095 | $\approx 5.7\%$ (1,200 net new stores) | $\approx -1.7\%$ | **4.0%** | **\$13,477** |
| **2029** | 23,295 | $\approx 5.4\%$ (1,200 net new stores) | $\approx -2.4\%$ | **3.0%** | **\$13,871** |
| **2030** | 24,495 | $\approx 5.2\%$ (1,200 net new stores) | $\approx -3.2\%$ | **2.0%** | **\$14,148** |

***Justification for Revenue Model:***
*   **2025:** The company's goal is to open 1,600-1,800 net new stores and achieve **mid-single-digit system sales growth**. I use the mid-point of 1,700 net new stores and the conservative low-end of mid-single-digit growth: **5.0%**. This implies a negative SSSG (-5.4%), which is a conservative assumption given the weak consumer environment in China, despite the new unit opening boom.
*   **2026-2030:** I model a constant **1,200-1,500 net new stores** per year, which is a significant, but decreasing percentage of the total base. I reduce the overall revenue growth rate from 5.0% down to a terminal **2.0%** by 2030. This is a very conservative ramp-down, acknowledging macro-headwinds and the eventual saturation of key markets.

### **B. Margin and Net Income Projections**

Management guided for the **Core Operating Profit (OP) margin to be relatively stable or slightly improve** in 2025, and a commitment to improving Pizza Hut margins in the mid-to-long run. The 2024 Net Income Margin was 8.06%.

I will model a conservative, gradual improvement in the Net Income Margin, assuming G&A efficiency gains and margin improvement at Pizza Hut outweigh wage inflation and value-driven pricing pressure.

| Year | Projected Revenue (\$Millions) | Net Income Margin (Conservative) | Net Income (A) (\$Millions) | Carry-over Cash from Prior Year Net Income (\$Millions) | ROIC on Prior Year Net Income (B) (\$Millions) | Final Net Income for Valuation (A + B) (\$Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 11,303 | 8.06% | 911 | - | - | **\$911** |
| **2025** | 11,868 | 8.10% | 961 | 911 | $911 * 8.0\% = 73$ | **\$1,034** |
| **2026** | 12,461 | 8.20% | 1,022 | 1,034 | $1,034 * 8.0\% = 83$ | **\$1,105** |
| **2027** | 12,959 | 8.30% | 1,076 | 1,105 | $1,105 * 8.0\% = 88$ | **\$1,164** |
| **2028** | 13,477 | 8.40% | 1,132 | 1,164 | $1,164 * 8.0\% = 93$ | **\$1,225** |
| **2029** | 13,871 | 8.50% | 1,180 | 1,225 | $1,225 * 8.0\% = 98$ | **\$1,278** |
| **2030** | 14,148 | 8.60% | 1,217 | 1,278 | $1,278 * 8.0\% = 102$ | **\$1,319** |

***Justification for ROIC:***
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Historical TTM ROIC is around 10.06% to 12.99%, while the 5-year average is 7.1%. Given the business is capital-intensive (new store rollout) but generates high returns on that capital (Bulls say new KFC units have a ~50% cash-on-cash return), I choose a conservative, yet positive **8.0%** ROIC to model the additional income generated by retaining and reinvesting the *previous year's net income* (which is assumed to convert straight to cash).

### **C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The Net Income for Valuation is used as a proxy for free cash flow in this simplified DCF model.

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative (high) rate, reflecting the perceived country risk of operating exclusively in China and the execution risk associated with the aggressive store expansion plan.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative terminal growth rate, aligning with long-term, inflation-adjusted GDP growth for a mature business model.

| Year | Projected Net Income (\$Millions) | Discount Factor @ 10.0% | Net Present Value (NPV) (\$Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1,034 | 0.909 | \$940 |
| **2026** | \$1,105 | 0.826 | \$913 |
| **2027** | \$1,164 | 0.751 | \$874 |
| **2028** | \$1,225 | 0.683 | \$837 |
| **2029** | \$1,278 | 0.621 | \$794 |
| **2030** | \$1,319 | 0.564 | \$744 |
| **Terminal Value** | \$1,319 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$16,810 | 0.564 | \$9,484 |
| **Total NPV (Fair Value of Operations)** | | | **\$14,586** |

---

## **III. Fair Value Calculation**

The total intrinsic value of the equity is calculated by combining the NPV of future cash flows and the current cash position, and then subtracting the total debt.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value of Operations (NPV)** | \$14,586 | Sum of Projected NPV and Terminal Value NPV. |
| **(+) Current Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$5,000 | From latest financial reports (Section I). |
| **(-) Current Total Debt** | (\$2,300) | From latest financial reports (Section I). |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **\$17,286** | *Calculation:* \$14,586 + \$5,000 - \$2,300. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 352.71 | From latest reports (Section I). |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$49.01** | *Calculation:* \$17,286M / 352.71M Shares. |

## **IV. Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **\$49.01** |
| **Current Market Value per Share** | **\$49.42** |
| **Difference** | **-0.83%** |

### **Justification for Difference**

The calculated **Fair Value per Share of \$49.01** is remarkably close to the **Current Market Value of \$49.42**. This minimal difference (less than 1%) suggests that the market's current consensus view is largely aligned with the conservative fundamental assumptions used in this DCF model.

**Market Assumptions Implied by the Valuation:**

1.  **Conservative Growth & SSSG Pressure:** The market is likely pricing in the aggressive new unit expansion (1,600+ new stores per year) but simultaneously modeling low to negative Same-Store Sales Growth (SSSG) due to macroeconomic headwinds in China and increasing competition (e.g., value focus, high-tech local rivals). My model's conservative 5.0% revenue growth for 2025 and subsequent decline, which implies negative SSSG, closely mirrors this reality.
2.  **Stable, High-Quality Margins:** The valuation relies on a stable and only modestly improving net income margin (8.10% to 8.60%). This suggests the market is confident in YUMC's ability to maintain its operational efficiency and G&A cost control (as guided by management to slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue) despite inflationary pressures and the need to offer value to consumers.
3.  **Moderate Reinvestment Returns:** The market appears to be discounting future cash flows with a moderate risk profile. The **10.0% Discount Rate** used and the **8.0% ROIC** on reinvested net income suggests the market believes YUMC is a high-quality, high-cash-flow business in a moderate-risk environment, which is a key assumption for an established market leader in a growing (but volatile) market like China.
4.  **Full Value of Net Cash:** The market is giving full credit for the large net cash position (\$2.7B net cash, or \$5.0B gross cash) on the balance sheet, which is a major component of the final share price.
