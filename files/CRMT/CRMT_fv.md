## Part 2: Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (FY2025 - FY2030)

America's Car-Mart's business engine is a "Buy Here Pay Here" (BHPH) model, where revenue is a combination of **Vehicle Sales Revenue** and **Interest Income** from the self-financed sales portfolio. The engine is driven by:

1.  **Retail Unit Volume:** Number of cars sold.
2.  **Average Retail Sales Price (ARP):** The price of the vehicle, which has been increasing.
3.  **Finance Receivables / Interest Income:** The principal balance of customer loans and the interest rate charged. This is the core profitability driver, critically tied to portfolio performance (Net Charge-Offs/NCOs and collections).

### Business Engine Assumptions

Management commentary suggests a strategic shift toward quality over volume, leveraging a new Loan Origination System (LOS V2) and an upgraded Pay Your Way collections platform.

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 Performance / Management Guidance | Assumption for Projections | Justification (Conservative Approach) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retail Unit Volume** | Decreased 5.7% YoY in Q1 FY26. | **Flat Growth (0.0%)** for FY2026-2027, then **1.0% Annual Growth** thereafter. | A flat-to-low growth assumption is conservative, acknowledging recent volume declines while factoring in potential stabilization from new operational/underwriting improvements. |
| **Average Selling Price (ARP)** | Q1 FY26 ARP increased. | **1.5% Annual Growth** for all years. | Reflects the general long-term inflation in used vehicle prices but is conservative compared to historical or initial post-lockdown spikes. |
| **Interest Income** | Increased 7.5% YoY in Q1 FY26. | **4.0% Annual Growth** for all years. | The rate is halved from the recent 7.5% to reflect a conservative view on long-term portfolio growth and potential interest rate normalization, though collections performance is improving (up 6.2%). |
| **Revenue Base (FY2025 Actual/Projection)** | FY2025 Total Revenue was approximately \$1.4 Billion. | **\$1,400.0M** | Using the reported FY2025 revenue figure as the base. |

### Revenue Projection Table (USD Millions)

| Metric | FY2025 (Base) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit Volume Growth** | N/A | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% | 1.0% |
| **ARP Growth** | N/A | 1.5% | 1.5% | 1.5% | 1.5% | 1.5% |
| **Sales Revenue Growth (Implied)** | N/A | 1.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% |
| **Interest Income Growth** | N/A | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% |
| **Total Revenue** | **1,400.0** | **1,438.5** | **1,480.9** | **1,528.0** | **1,577.1** | **1,627.9** |

*Calculation Note: Sales revenue and interest income are assumed to grow proportionally based on the historical mix, and then the total revenue is adjusted by the projected growth rates.*

## Part 3: Net Income Projections

### Margin Assumptions

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 / Guidance | Assumption | Justification (Conservative Approach) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin %** | Q1 FY26: 36.6%. Guidance: Driving toward 37-38%. | **37.0%** | Uses the low end of management's stated target range to remain conservative, acknowledging the goal of improved procurement and disposal. |
| **Net Income Margin %** | FY2025 Net Income: \$17.9M. Q1 FY26 Loss per share: \$0.69. | **1.5%** | FY2025 Net Income Margin was 1.28% (\$17.9M / \$1.4B). The projection uses a slightly higher, but very conservative, margin (1.5%) to account for management's stated focus on operational efficiencies, credit improvements, and the return to profitability. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) %** | Historically volatile/negative during turnaround. | **2.0%** | A very conservative positive rate. ROIC is used for additional income generation from accumulated prior-year cash (per instructions). Since the business is capital-intensive (financing receivables), a low, stable positive ROIC is a cautious long-term assumption. |

### Net Income Projection Table (USD Millions)

| Metric | FY2025 (Base) | FY2026 | FY2027 | FY2028 | FY2029 | FY2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue (A)** | 1,400.0 | 1,438.5 | 1,480.9 | 1,528.0 | 1,577.1 | 1,627.9 |
| **Net Income Margin** | 1.28% | 1.50% | 1.50% | 1.50% | 1.50% | 1.50% |
| **Net Income from Operations (B)** | 17.9 | 21.6 | 22.2 | 22.9 | 23.7 | 24.4 |
| **Prior Year Cash for ROIC (C)** | N/A | 17.9 | 39.5 | 62.4 | 87.0 | 113.8 |
| **Additional Income (C * 2.0%) (D)** | N/A | 0.36 | 0.79 | 1.25 | 1.74 | 2.28 |
| **Total Projected Net Income (B + D)** | **17.9** | **22.0** | **23.0** | **24.1** | **25.4** | **26.7** |
| **Cumulative Cash (For Next Year ROIC)** | 17.9 | 39.9 | 62.9 | 87.0 | 112.4 | 139.1 |

## Part 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

We use the Total Projected Net Income as the conservative cash flow available for shareholders, as instructed ("net income for each year goes straight into cash").

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification (Conservative Approach) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy)** | **10.0%** | Represents a reasonable return hurdle for a company in the volatile subprime auto finance market. This is a conservative WACC/required rate of return. |
| **Maturity (Terminal) Rate** | **2.0%** | A very conservative, low rate, slightly above the long-term US inflation target, assuming the company grows at a minimal, sustainable rate after 2030. |

### NPV Calculation

| Year (Fiscal) | Projected Cash Flow (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (at 10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | 22.0 | 0.9091 | 20.00 |
| **2027** | 23.0 | 0.8264 | 19.00 |
| **2028** | 24.1 | 0.7513 | 18.11 |
| **2029** | 25.4 | 0.6830 | 17.34 |
| **2030** | 26.7 | 0.6209 | 16.58 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026 - 2030)** | | | **\$91.03M** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   Terminal Cash Flow (2031) = Projected Cash Flow (2030) $\times$ (1 + Maturity Rate)
    *   TV Cash Flow = \$26.7M $\times$ (1 + 0.02) = \$27.23M
*   Terminal Value at EOY 2030 = TV Cash Flow / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    *   TV at EOY 2030 = \$27.23M / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$340.38M
*   Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV) = TV at EOY 2030 $\times$ Discount Factor (2030)
    *   NPV TV = \$340.38M $\times$ 0.6209 = **\$211.33M**

### Total Equity Value

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** Sum of NPV (2026-2030) + NPV TV
    *   TEV = \$91.03M + \$211.33M = **\$302.36M**
*   **Total Equity Value:** TEV + Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
    *   Total Equity Value = \$302.36M + \$9.67M - \$782.60M = **-\$470.57M**

## Part 5: Fair Value and Justification

### Fair Value Calculation

*   **Fair Value per Share:** Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
    *   Fair Value per Share = -\$470.57M / 8.28 million shares = **-\$56.83**

---
### **Fair Value of America's Car-Mart, Inc. (CRMT) Stock: - \$56.83**
---

### Market Comparison and Justification

The fair value calculation yields a negative value, meaning that based on the projected net income cash flows and conservative assumptions, the company's significant debt load exceeds the present value of its future cash flows plus its current cash reserves.

The assumptions used:

1.  **Conservative Growth:** Flat-to-low revenue growth (1.5%-2.5% annually) despite management's focus on operational improvements and a multi-year turnaround.
2.  **Conservative Margins:** A low, stable 1.5% Net Income Margin is used, which is only slightly higher than the FY2025 actual of 1.28%.
3.  **Conservative ROIC:** A very low 2.0% ROIC is used for cash compounding.
4.  **High Discount Rate:** A 10.0% discount rate is a high hurdle for a stable/slow-growth company, reflecting the high-risk nature of the subprime auto lending industry.
5.  **Low Terminal Growth Rate:** A 2.0% terminal rate is very conservative.

**The disconnect with the market value** (which would be the current stock price, let's assume it is **\$22.50** for context as a proxy for the current value of the stock, but the exact current value must be used by the user) is due to the market making very different, and likely more optimistic, assumptions.

**Why the valuation is so different from the market:**

*   **Market Assumption 1: Significant Increase in Profitability (Margin Expansion is Underestimated):** The market is likely pricing in the successful execution of management's strategy regarding the new LOS V2 and Pay Your Way platforms. This is expected to significantly reduce NCOs and credit losses, which are the largest variable expenses for a BHPH model. If the Net Income Margin were to reach **3.5% - 4.0%** (a significant margin improvement based on operational efficiencies), the equity value would become positive.
*   **Market Assumption 2: Higher Revenue Growth through Unit Volume:** The market may believe that once the underwriting and collections platforms are stabilized and proven, the company will resume its historical unit expansion (the number of units sold decreased by 5.7% in Q1 FY26). The market may be assuming the company can return to 5%-10% unit growth, which would dramatically change the revenue projections.
*   **Market Assumption 3: Turnaround Execution and Lower Risk:** The market may be placing a high probability on the successful *de-risking* of the high-leverage business. A successful turnaround leading to a higher credit rating or more favorable securitization terms (already seen an improvement in weighted average coupon on securitizations) would lower the cost of debt and thus allow for a *lower* discount rate, which would significantly increase the Net Present Value of future cash flows.

**Conclusion:**

This conservative DCF valuation indicates that **America's Car-Mart is significantly over-leveraged for its current and projected profitability levels**. For the stock to have a positive fair value, the company must execute on its turnaround plan to a degree that delivers:
1.  A Net Income Margin greater than 3.5% consistently; *or*
2.  A much higher rate of revenue growth (e.g., 5%+ annual revenue growth with current margins) in tandem with the cost of debt being materially reduced.

The negative fair value is a strong reflection of the company's *high financial risk* (high debt) against its *low operational return* (low net margin) under conservative growth assumptions. The market is betting on a rapid and successful execution of the management's technological and operational efficiency initiatives to *substantially* boost the net income margin to levels not yet consistently seen.
