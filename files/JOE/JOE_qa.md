## Business Summary

The St. Joe Company (JOE) is a real estate operating company and major landowner focusing exclusively on Northwest Florida, primarily developing properties near the coast in Bay and Walton counties. Its core business model is to transform large, undeveloped land tracts into integrated, master-planned communities. The company generates revenue across three main segments: residential development (building and selling homes and lots), commercial leasing (owning and operating shopping centers, apartments, and offices), and resort operations (running hotels, golf clubs, and marinas). This diversified approach allows JOE to profit from initial land sales while creating a stable, recurring revenue stream from rents and club memberships. Customers are often affluent retirees, second-home buyers, and migrating families, primarily drawn from the Southeastern U.S., seeking lifestyle amenities and proximity to the Gulf Coast.

## Business Model Risk

The principal near-term risk involves exposure to rising interest rates and high inflation. Since home buyers rely on mortgages and construction costs are increasing, rising interest rates reduce affordability, slowing down residential sales and potentially pressuring profit margins on new developments. A significant long-term risk stems from the company's extreme geographic concentration in coastal Northwest Florida, making it acutely vulnerable to severe weather events. Historically, major hurricanes like Michael or Ivan have caused billions in regional damage, disrupting construction, destroying existing assets, and causing insurance rates to spike, which deters future buyers. Another major long-term risk is the cyclical nature of the real estate market. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008 severely hampered JOE, proving that a national recession can dramatically reduce demand for housing and depress land values, posing a constant threat to the company’s earnings and market position if economic conditions deteriorate.

## Company History

The St. Joe Company, often referred to simply as "St. Joe" (NYSE: JOE), has a nearly 90-year history marked by a dramatic shift from industrial manufacturing to large-scale real estate development. Its current goal is to transform its vast land holdings in Northwest Florida into thriving, modern communities.

### I. Inception and Original Purpose (1936 to Mid-1990s)

1.  **Founded as a Charitable Instrument:** The company was formally established in 1936 as the St. Joe Paper Company through the will of industrialist Alfred I. duPont.
2.  **The Ultimate Mission:** The core purpose of the company's assets was to provide ongoing funding for the Nemours Foundation, a charitable trust dedicated to the care and rehabilitation of crippled children with curable afflictions.
3.  **The Initial Business:** To fulfill its charitable mandate, the company utilized duPont’s extensive land holdings in Florida to operate a paper mill, which became its namesake, along with timber operations, an associated railroad, and other businesses.
4.  **Early Asset Accumulation:** Under the management of duPont’s brother-in-law, Ed Ball, the company amassed over a million acres of land, becoming one of the largest private landowners in Florida.

### II. The Core Problem and Innovative Solution (Mid-1990s Pivot)

5.  **The Headwind of an Outdated Model:** By the 1990s, the paper and industrial businesses were no longer the most valuable part of the company, and its overall structure was a scattered mix of non-core assets like sugar, rail, and telecom. The true, untapped value was locked in the immense Florida land holdings.
6.  **Innovative Solution: The Great Pivot:** Starting in the mid-1990s, the company made a fundamental and dramatic strategic shift, selling off the paper mill, railroad, and most of its other industrial holdings to focus entirely on real estate development.
7.  **New Goal and Identity:** The company changed its name to The St. Joe Company and declared its new focus to be "opening its abundant storehouse of value" by developing residential, commercial, and resort properties.

### III. The Modern Strategy: Development and Recurring Revenue

8.  **The "Placemaking" Strategy:** The company's innovative approach shifted from simply selling undeveloped land to becoming a master developer that creates entire planned communities, a process known as "placemaking".
9.  **Land Use Management (Headwind Solution):** To address concerns about large-scale development, the company has incorporated extensive conservation efforts, placing tens of thousands of acres into permanent conservation, which also helps gain regulatory approval for the remaining development sites.
10. **The Key Tailwinds:** St. Joe has benefited significantly from the continuous population growth and migration to Florida, particularly Northwest Florida (the Panhandle region), driven by people looking for second homes, retirement spots, or a better quality of life.
11. **Strategic Infrastructure Tailwind:** A major move was donating land for the construction of the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP) in 2010, which was a critical piece of infrastructure that increased tourism and accessibility, thus driving demand for their properties.
12. **Innovative Financial Solution: Recurring Revenue:** A major innovation in their business model is the focus on **recurring revenue** to stabilize income, rather than relying solely on one-time land sales.
13. **How Recurring Revenue Works:** This is achieved through operating a growing portfolio of hotels, leasing commercial spaces in their communities, and offering the exclusive *Watersound Club* membership program, which provides a steady stream of income from membership fees and dues.
14. **Current Headwinds and Mitigation:** The company still deals with macroeconomic headwinds like rising interest rates, inflation, and higher construction costs. Their solution is to keep aggressively expanding their higher-margin, recurring-revenue segments like hospitality and leasing, which provides a financial cushion against fluctuations in the residential housing market.

### IV. Present Day and Future Goal

15. **Current Business Segments:** Today, The St. Joe Company operates through three main business segments: **Residential** (developing homesites), **Hospitality** (hotels, resorts, and the Watersound Club), and **Commercial** (leasing office, retail, and industrial spaces).
16. **Long-Term Goal:** The company’s long-term goal is to leverage its remaining 168,000 acres of land to build comprehensive, integrated, and sustainable communities that attract new residents and tourists, ensuring a long-term stream of value for the charitable trust that remains a significant shareholder.

## Moat Analysis

The St. Joe Company (JOE) is a unique real estate company whose moat—its sustainable competitive advantage—stems primarily from an irreplaceable, historical asset rather than ongoing technological innovation.

### Analysis of The St. Joe Company’s Moat

1.  **Irreplaceable Land Bank and Low Cost-Basis:** The company owns approximately 170,000 acres of land, mostly concentrated in the high-growth Northwest Florida Panhandle (Bay and Walton Counties). This massive, well-located land bank was largely acquired decades ago at a historically low cost, which a modern competitor cannot replicate today.
2.  **Long-Term, Vested Development Rights (Entitlements):** A key differentiator is the long-term, comprehensive **Bay-Walton Sector Plan**, which grants legal entitlements to develop over 170,000 homes and 22 million square feet of commercial space over the next 50 years. This pre-approved capacity eliminates significant regulatory and permitting risk for future projects, creating a barrier to entry for rivals.
3.  **Integrated, Master-Planned Community Strategy (Placemaking):** JOE’s strategy is not just selling bare land; it develops entire, cohesive, master-planned destinations that integrate residential communities, commercial centers, hotels, golf clubs, and marinas. This placemaking creates a premium experience and fosters brand loyalty that generic developers cannot match.

***

### Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Market Position

1.  **What makes it different from competitors?** Traditional homebuilders and developers buy smaller, discrete parcels of land, whereas JOE acts as a master developer controlling the entire scope of a vast geographic area. They control the development of the entire ecosystem—from where the grocery store goes to the location of the luxury resort—a level of control unmatched by regional competitors.
2.  **Special Pricing Power:** The creation of exclusive amenities, such as the premium **Watersound Club** with its golf courses, resorts, and access to private beaches, gives the company a form of pricing power. They can command premium prices for homesites and command recurring membership fees because the amenities and lifestyle they offer are exclusive to their communities.
3.  **Special Position in the Market:** They are the largest private landowner in a high-growth region of Florida, and their long-term entitlements grant them a virtual monopoly on large-scale, planned community development in the area, which is their special position.

***

### Origin of Growth and Ease of Displacement

1.  **Reason it grew into what it is today:** The company's origin was a historical accident/strategy, evolving from a paper company in the mid-1990s that realized the immense, low-cost value of its vast Florida timberland. The transition to a real estate focus allowed them to unlock this deeply discounted land value as the Northwest Florida coast became a highly desirable location.
2.  **How easily can it be displaced by more capital?** It is difficult to displace JOE, even with a massive capital injection. A competitor could acquire smaller tracts of land, but they cannot buy a comparable 170,000-acre contiguous land bank at a similar low cost-basis, nor can they easily replicate the decades-in-the-making, pre-approved development rights that JOE holds.

***

### Stickiness and Moat-Building Activities

1.  **Customer/Contracts Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The company is intentionally shifting its business to be less reliant on one-time land sales. Their Hospitality and Leasing segments, which generate **recurring revenue**, are a growing part of the moat. This includes long-term commercial leases, apartment rents, and sticky membership dues from the Watersound Club.
2.  **Moat-Building Activities (Past/Now):**
    *   **Past:** Securing the huge, low-cost land portfolio and achieving the massive, long-term regulatory approval (the Bay-Walton Sector Plan) which acts as a profound advantage and regulatory barrier.
    *   **Now:** Building an ecosystem of income-producing assets (hotels, commercial spaces, apartments) that increase the value and desirability of their residential homesites. They are also launching "asset-light" businesses, such as real estate brokerage, insurance, and title agencies, to capture ancillary recurring revenue from residents within their communities.
3.  **Network Effects:** Their master-planned developments and the exclusive club membership (Watersound Club) create a local network effect. As more homes, businesses, and amenities are built, the overall value and desirability of living in the community increase for every resident, making the homesites more valuable and the community harder to leave.

***

### R&D and Innovation

1.  **R&D and Constant Innovation:** As a real estate developer, JOE does not invest heavily in traditional R&D.
2.  **The form of Innovation:** Their innovation is focused on **business model differentiation and placemaking**, rather than product development. This includes the strategic shift to a mixed-use, recurring-revenue model (Leasing and Hospitality) and the continuous creation of highly desirable, new amenities to maintain their competitive edge in attracting residents and businesses.

## Catalyst Analysis

The St. Joe Company (JOE) is a real estate development, asset management, and operating company focused on Northwest Florida. Its primary catalysts are rooted in its strategic shift towards building and operating a diversified portfolio that generates recurring revenue.

### Management's Stated Strategy (Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Strategic Transformation:** Management, led by CEO Jorge Gonzalez, emphasizes the shift from being primarily a transactional land sales company to a diversified real estate operating company with multiple recurring revenue streams.
*   **"Virtuous Circle of Value Creation":** The core strategy is to grow and enhance the Northwest Florida ecosystem by developing master-planned residential communities, hospitality assets, and commercial leasing properties. Management states that investments in one area enhance the value of adjacent assets.
*   **Focus on Recurring Revenue:** Management highlights the growth of its recurring revenue streams (Hospitality and Leasing), which accounted for 63% of total revenue in the first half of 2025, showing the success of the new operating model.
*   **Capital Allocation:** The company has a "measured and multifaceted" capital allocation strategy, which includes funding growth-related capital expenditures, paying cash dividends, repaying debt, and executing share repurchases. The Board increased the stock repurchase authority to $100 million in Q4 2024.

***

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Strong Recurring Revenue Growth:** Continued growth in the Hospitality and Leasing segments should provide more predictable revenue and improve margins. Management has noted record revenues in both segments, driven by new hotel openings in 2023 and the expansion of the Watersound Club membership program.
2.  **New Commercial and Hospitality Openings:** The opening of new developments, like the Topgolf at Pier Park City Center and a planned Publix at Watersound West Bay Center, will immediately add to the leasing revenue stream. New hotels opened in 2023 also continue to ramp up revenue.
3.  **Increased Shareholder Returns:** The acceleration of stock repurchases, including the increased $100 million authority, can boost Earnings Per Share (EPS) and signal management's belief that the stock is undervalued.
4.  **Population and Infrastructure Growth:** New non-stop daily flights between Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP) and New York City's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) improve accessibility, which is a key driver for both residential and hospitality demand.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Land Value Appreciation:** The company holds significant land in Northwest Florida with extensive land-use entitlements. The long-term success of their master-planned communities and commercial developments increases the value of their remaining undeveloped and entitled land.
2.  **Scalable Master-Planned Communities:** The large-scale residential communities like the Latitude Margaritaville Watersound joint venture and other master-planned areas offer a long runway for recurring homesite sales and associated amenity revenue over many years.
3.  **Expansion of the Ecosystem:** The "virtuous circle" strategy suggests that as the region becomes a more desirable place to live and visit, demand and pricing power across all three segments—Residential, Hospitality, and Commercial—will increase over time.
4.  **Asset-Light Revenue Streams:** The company is expanding its complementary businesses, such as launching its own boutique real estate brokerage (WaterSound Real Estate), which leverages its core assets to generate additional, high-margin, recurring revenue without large capital investments.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of The St. Joe Company's (JOE) management incentive and compensation structure suggests a strong alignment with shareholder interests, driven primarily by an exceptional level of insider ownership.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for The St. Joe Company (JOE)**

1.  **Insider Ownership (High):** A highly significant portion of the company's stock is controlled by an insider. Fairholme Capital Management LLC, which is controlled by Director Bruce R. Berkowitz, is the largest shareholder and owns approximately **40.21%** of the company's shares.

2.  **Alignment with Shareholders:** This substantial concentration of ownership by a director and associated entity is a powerful mechanism for alignment. Since their wealth is overwhelmingly tied to the company's long-term stock performance, the major insider has a strong, vested interest in maximizing shareholder value, which is generally a positive signal for other investors.

3.  **Executive Compensation Structure:** The compensation for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jorge Gonzalez is heavily performance-based, with **67.2%** of his total yearly compensation comprised of bonuses, including company stock and options, and only 32.8% as base salary. This mix heavily weights pay towards incentive-based awards.

4.  **Focus on Company Performance:** The Compensation Committee's stated philosophy is to tie long-term incentive components of CEO pay to the company’s performance and relative shareholder return. This directly links executive wealth creation to the success experienced by all shareholders. [cite: 2 (from step 1), 3 (from step 1)]

5.  **Performance Metrics:** While the specific formulaic targets are not fully detailed in the public summaries, the company focuses on and reports key financial metrics like **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), **Net Income**, and **Revenue Growth**, suggesting these operational results are likely drivers for incentive plan payouts. [cite: 7, 8, 1 (from step 1)]

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

The management and directors of The St. Joe Company appear to have **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The single largest factor is the **over 40% beneficial ownership by a key director's entity**, which ensures a massive degree of personal capital is aligned with all shareholders.
*   The executive pay mix further reinforces this by relying on incentive-based awards (stock and options) for the majority of compensation, thereby discouraging a focus purely on short-term gains at the expense of long-term value.

## Price History

The St. Joe Company (JOE) is a real estate development company primarily focused on Northwest Florida.

Here is an analysis of its recent price history and technical outlook:

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low**
    *   The stock is currently trading approximately **23.11%** above its 52-week low.
    *   Based on a recent closing price of about \$49.48 and a 52-week low of \$40.19, the price has recovered significantly from its floor.

2.  **Technical Analysis: Is JOE Trading Low?**
    *   Technical analysis offers a mixed but generally constructive short-term view; some indicators suggest a "buy" signal, while others indicate a "bearish" sentiment.
    *   Moving Averages, a key trend-following indicator, often show a "Strong Buy" or "Buy" outlook, suggesting a positive momentum in the medium to long term.
    *   However, the stock is currently moving within a horizontal trading channel and has support at approximately \$49.34, suggesting it is not far from a recent consolidated range.

3.  **Explanation of Big Drops and Gains**
    *   **Prior Downturn/Drop:** The stock experienced a significant downturn over the preceding year, with a one-year change of approximately -26.24% as of early 2025, largely due to rising interest rates that have impacted public real estate valuations.
    *   **Recent Strength/Long-Term Gain Drivers:** The company has recently surpassed growth expectations, with revenue and EBITDA doubling since 2021, driven by robust development activity like the Latitude Margaritaville Watersound project.
    *   **Positive Capital Actions:** JOE has demonstrated disciplined capital allocation by accelerating share repurchases and boosting its quarterly dividend to \$0.14 per share, which supports a sustainable long-term growth trajectory.
    *   **Short-Term Dip:** Despite the long-term growth, the stock has experienced short-term pressure, falling by over 4% in a recent 10-day trading period and a month-over-month fall of nearly 3% as of September 2025.

## Long Thesis

The St. Joe Company (JOE) is transitioning from being a simple land seller into a powerful, diversified real estate operator with a 50-year growth runway. The bull case rests on two core strengths: 1) They own an irreplaceable, 170,000-acre land bank in high-demand Northwest Florida, acquired decades ago at a near-zero cost, giving them a massive competitive advantage. 2) They possess unique, pre-approved government rights (entitlements) to develop this land, creating a virtual monopoly on large-scale community building in the region. In the near term, JOE is accelerating its shift toward stable, high-margin income by aggressively opening new hotels, apartments, and commercial centers (Leasing and Hospitality segments). These recurring revenue streams provide a financial cushion against housing market slowdowns caused by high interest rates. In the long term, by acting as the master developer, JOE creates a 'virtuous circle' where building exclusive amenities (like the Watersound Club and resorts) drives up the price of their remaining undeveloped land. As affluent residents and businesses continue migrating to the Florida Panhandle, JOE controls the entire ecosystem, ensuring decades of predictable, high-margin sales and cash flow as they unlock the value of their vast, low-cost real estate assets.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

Continued robust population growth and migration into Northwest Florida must sustain demand for both residential and commercial properties. The management team must successfully execute its complex strategy of developing master-planned communities and effectively scaling up the high-margin recurring revenue segments (Hospitality and Leasing). The region must avoid catastrophic, frequent severe weather events (hurricanes) that could disrupt construction timelines and permanently depress the desirability of coastal real estate. Finally, interest rates must either stabilize or decline enough over the long term to maintain housing affordability and demand for primary and secondary homes.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and vulnerabilities in the long thesis for The St. Joe Company (JOE), primarily revolving around the sustainability of key demand assumptions, the high cost of growth, and significant unpriced risks.

## Critique of the Long Thesis: Finding Holes and Faults

### **1. Extreme Valuation and Priced-In Growth**

*   **High Valuation Multiple:** The company trades at a significantly high valuation multiple (e.g., a trailing P/E ratio around 35x and an EV/EBITDA multiple around 23x), which suggests the market has already heavily factored in decades of the anticipated "50-year growth runway." Any moderate deviation from the aggressive growth plan could lead to a sharp contraction in the stock price.
*   **Decelerating Core Segment:** While the long thesis touts high-margin growth, recent financial reports show potential strain in the core Real Estate segment: the average base price and gross margin on homesite sales have decreased year-over-year, and the number of residential homesites under contract has declined. This suggests pricing pressure and a possible slowdown in future closings.

### **2. Sustainability of the Northwest Florida Demand Assumption**

*   **Affordability and Migration Headwinds:** The bull case relies on **"continued robust population growth and migration,"** but Florida is facing a severe housing affordability crisis, with a large percentage of households heavily "cost burdened." This crisis threatens the supply of the necessary local workforce (teachers, service workers, etc.) required to staff the new commercial centers and hotels in JOE's master-planned communities, ultimately capping growth.
*   **Competition from Cheaper States:** The rapid rise in Florida's cost of living and insurance is projected to cause population growth to moderate, with a forecasted increase in out-migration to other Sunbelt states like Georgia and North Carolina, which offer a lower cost of living and a competitive tax environment. This erodes the unique "high-demand" advantage.

### **3. Understated Catastrophic/Climate Risk**

*   **High Hurricane Risk and Operating Costs:** The assumption that the region will **"avoid catastrophic, frequent severe weather events"** is optimistic for a Florida Panhandle-focused real estate company. Major hurricanes like Michael (a Category 5 storm that hit JOE's area) caused an estimated $25 billion in damage, temporarily froze real estate activity, and led to a permanent increase in insurance costs. This rising insurance and risk-mitigation cost will inevitably undercut the "stable, high-margin income" narrative of the Hospitality and Leasing segments.
*   **Infrastructure and Timeline Disruption:** Severe weather events cause massive infrastructure damage and labor shortages that result in significant construction delays and cost overruns, undermining the assumed reliability of construction timelines and pushing out the monetization schedule for the "50-year runway."

### **4. Challenging the "Irreplaceable Land" and "Entitlements" Monopoly**

*   **Land Quality and Development Costs:** While the company owns 170,000 acres, long-standing critiques suggest much of this remaining land is remote, inland, and may be difficult or expensive to develop (e.g., swampy or industrial pine land), questioning the blanket term "irreplaceable" and increasing the effective, non-near-zero cost of developing the long-term pipeline.
*   **Historical Governance and Legal/Reputational Risk:** The company's past includes charges by the SEC for improper accounting of real estate impairments during the 2009-2011 period, which raises concerns about long-term management oversight and governance execution risk. Furthermore, historical allegations related to toxic waste dumping in an adjacent community (North Port St. Joe) and subsequent development issues suggest potential future legal or environmental opposition that could slow development or damage the company's public image.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for The St. Joe Company (JOE)

The bull case's "50-year growth runway" is a mirage discounted by the high current valuation, and the "virtuous circle" is highly vulnerable to external economic and environmental forces, creating significant downside risk.

**1. Premium Valuation, Discounted Growth:** The stock's high valuation multiples suggest that decades of future growth are already priced in, leaving no margin for error. A slowdown in homesite contract volume and a decline in average sales price and gross margin in the Real Estate segment indicates that growth is becoming more costly and less profitable.

**2. The Affordability and Migration Tipping Point:** The underlying assumption of "robust migration" is flawed as Florida's spiraling housing and insurance costs are actively pushing out the local workforce and causing migration to slow, which will starve JOE's future commercial and hospitality properties of the necessary labor and mid-range customer base. This creates a ceiling on the growth of the recurring revenue streams.

**3. Climate Risk Undermines "Stable, High-Margin Income":** Northwest Florida's extreme exposure to catastrophic hurricanes is a structural, unmitigable risk that translates directly into perpetually rising insurance and construction costs. This permanently elevates the cost basis for JOE's Leasing and Hospitality assets, making the "stable, high-margin income" significantly less reliable than modeled and threatening to depress long-term property values across the entire region.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your extensive analysis, you have successfully quantified the core debate between the Bull and Bear theses. You have strong data on recurring revenue growth, real estate segment deceleration, and macro risks (affordability/insurance).

The next steps should focus on reconciling the massive valuation gap, scrutinizing the cost of future growth, and confirming the strength of the "sticky" revenue moat.

### **Important Questions Still Left Unanswered**

1.  **Reconcile the Net Asset Value (NAV) vs. DCF Valuation:**
    *   What are the specific acreage and valuation assumptions ($/acre) used in the bullish **\$53,543/acre** NAV model (which suggests the stock is undervalued) versus the **\$15,449/acre** market valuation? The difference is the key to the entire thesis.
    *   *Follow-up:* Find a third-party analyst report that explicitly breaks down the remaining land into different categories (e.g., entitled, potential development, conservation, timber) and assigns a defensible, comparable market value to each.

2.  **Evaluate Sustainability and Efficiency of Capital Expenditure (CapEx):**
    *   The company's CapEx (\$69.2 million in 1H 2025) significantly exceeds its Net Income (\$47 million in 1H 2025). Analyze the free cash flow (FCF) after all CapEx and dividends to determine how much new development is being funded by operating cash flow versus debt or asset sales.
    *   *Follow-up:* The reported Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 4.89% is below the estimated Cost of Capital (11.00%). Scrutinize the operating performance (EBITDA margins) of recently completed Hospitality and Leasing assets (e.g., 2023 hotel openings) to see if *newer* projects are generating returns above that 11% threshold, thereby justifying the high CapEx.

3.  **Quantify the Watersound Club Recurring Revenue Moat:**
    *   Determine the approximate average *upfront initiation fee* and the *average annual/monthly dues* for the Watersound Club (proprietary numbers are hard to find, but look for forum/realtor data). This is critical for modeling the high-margin recurring cash flow.
    *   *Follow-up:* Investigate the total current, active **Watersound Club membership count**. Membership size is the direct multiplier for the recurring revenue and a key barometer of the company's long-term operating segment success.

4.  **Long-Term Impact of Macro Headwinds on End-Customer Pricing:**
    *   The price/margin drop in recent homesite sales, combined with exploding property insurance costs (averaging nearly \$12,000 in Florida), suggests the end-buyer's total cost of ownership is rising sharply.
    *   *Follow-up:* Estimate the impact of a permanent 20% to 50% increase in annual insurance costs on the effective mortgage-and-insurance payment for a typical JOE buyer, and model what this might do to the ultimate achievable price of their homesites over the next five years.
