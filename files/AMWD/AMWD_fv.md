## 2. Business Engine and Conservative Revenue Projections

American Woodmark's business engine is driven by two primary markets: **new construction** and **repair & remodel (R&R)**, which are directly tied to the U.S. housing market's health (e.g., interest rates, home sales, and consumer confidence).

Management's commentary points to a challenging macroeconomic environment with "lower consumer confidence" impacting high-ticket R&R projects and slower demand in new construction. The long-term strategy, "GDP" (Growth, Digital Transformation, Platform Design), aims to drive long-term growth and margin improvement through the cycle.

**Assumptions for Conservative Revenue Growth:**

*   **FY2026 (Ending April 30, 2026):** Management's last guidance (May 2025) was for **low-single-digit declines to low-single-digit increases** in net sales. The first six months of FY2026 showed a 12.5% decline. Given the ongoing market challenges (interest rates, tariffs) and the actual decline in the first half, a **conservative decline of 5.5%** for the full year is used, which is better than the first half run-rate but accounts for the headwinds and uncertainty which caused the company to stop providing guidance.
*   **FY2027 (Recovery):** The U.S. housing cycle is long-term sound, but recovery is slow. We project a modest rebound in FY2027, with a **3.0% growth** rate, reflecting a slow return to normalized housing activity.
*   **FY2028 - FY2030 (Normalized Growth):** Assuming a normalized housing market and execution of the "GDP" strategy, the company is projected to achieve mid-single-digit growth, starting conservatively at **4.0%**, and stepping up to **4.5%** and **5.0%** as operational efficiencies and market penetration initiatives (like the '1951 Cabinetry' brand) mature.

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Estimate) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales (M USD)** | **\$1,709.6** | **\$1,616.6** | **\$1,665.1** | **\$1,731.7** | **\$1,809.5** | **\$1,899.9** |
| **Revenue Growth** | -7.5% | **-5.5%** | **3.0%** | **4.0%** | **4.5%** | **5.0%** |

## 3. Margin Projections

Management's long-term strategy is explicitly focused on *margin improvement* through "Platform Design" and "operational excellence".

*   **FY2025 Net Income Margin (Actual):** 5.8% (\$99.5M / \$1,709.6M)
*   **FY2026 Net Income Margin (Estimate):** Based on the conservative FY2026 revenue decline and the impact of higher tariff/input costs, restructuring, and merger-related expenses already seen in the first half of FY2026 (Q2 Net Income Margin of 1.5%), the full-year margin will be pressured. We project a severe, but improving, net margin of **3.5%** for the full year, assuming some cost mitigation efforts take effect in the second half.
*   **FY2027 - FY2030 (Projection):** As the market recovers and operational efficiency drives margin improvement as guided by management's strategy, the net margin is projected to gradually expand, aiming for a post-downturn stable range.

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Estimate) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin** | 5.8% | **3.5%** | **4.0%** | **4.5%** | **5.0%** | **5.5%** |
| **Net Income (Initial) (M USD)** | \$99.5 | **\$56.6** | **\$66.6** | **\$77.9** | **\$90.5** | **\$104.5** |

## 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Projection

The required valuation formula is: $Net Income_{N} = Net Income_{N, assumptions} + ROIC \times Net Income_{N-1}$. This treats the prior year's Net Income as a proxy for retained earnings that generate "additional income" at the ROIC rate.

**ROIC Assumption:** Historically, ROIC for a cyclical, capital-intensive company like AMWD is variable. Given the instruction to be **conservative** and use a positive ROIC if past ROIC is negative, we will select a conservative but reasonable positive rate.

**Conservative ROIC:** **6.0%** (This reflects a steady, low-return on the prior year's retained earnings/net income, well below peak historical returns but above zero, in line with the conservative approach).

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Net Income (Initial) (A) | \$99.5 | \$56.6 | \$66.6 | \$77.9 | \$90.5 | \$104.5 |
| Add: ROIC (6.0%) on NI (N-1) (B) | - | \$5.97 | \$3.40 | \$4.00 | \$4.67 | \$5.43 |
| **Net Income for DCF (A+B) (M USD)** | **\$99.5** | **\$62.6** | **\$70.0** | **\$81.9** | **\$95.2** | **\$109.9** |

## 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for DCF is used as the projected Free Cash Flow (FCF), as per the assumption that "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."

**DCF Assumptions (Conservative):**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** Given the current high-interest-rate environment and the cyclical/operational risk in the housing/cabinetry industry, a conservative but reasonable **10.0%** WACC is chosen.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%** is used, reflecting growth just above the U.S. long-term inflation goal and below normalized GDP growth, as the business is mature and cyclical.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (End of FY2030):**
$$TV = \frac{FCF_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
$$TV = \frac{\text{\$109.9 M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\text{\$112.1 M}}{0.08} = \text{\$1,401.3 M}$$

| Year (FY ending Apr 30) | Projected FCF (Net Income for DCF) (M USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of FCF (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$62.6 | 0.909 | \$56.9 |
| **2027** | \$70.0 | 0.826 | \$57.8 |
| **2028** | \$81.9 | 0.751 | \$61.5 |
| **2029** | \$95.2 | 0.683 | \$65.0 |
| **2030 (Operating FCF)** | \$109.9 | 0.621 | \$68.3 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | \$1,401.3 | 0.621 | \$870.3 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$1,179.8 M** |

## 6. Fair Value Calculation

## 7. Justification and Reconciliation with Market Value

The calculated Fair Value per Share for the standalone American Woodmark Corporation is **\$55.96**.

**Current Market Value Justification:**

The market value of AMWD stock at the time of the latest data is not provided, but the question implies it may be different from the calculated fair value.

*   **The Primary Justification - The Merger:** The most critical factor driving a potential difference between this *standalone* DCF valuation and the current market price is the pending all-stock merger with **MasterBrand, Inc.**, which was approved by shareholders in October 2025.
    *   Once the merger closes, AMWD stock will convert to a new structure based on the exchange ratio, and the market price will reflect the value of the combined entity's future cash flows, including *synergies* and a broader product portfolio, which are not captured in this AMWD standalone DCF model.
*   **The Valuation Gap:**
    *   **If Market Price > \$55.96:** The market is likely pricing in the value of the **synergies** from the merger, a more optimistic outlook for the combined entity's market power, and a higher growth rate or net income margin for the post-merger company than the conservative estimates used here. The market may also be projecting a faster recovery in the housing market than the conservative 3.0%-5.0% growth used in the model.
    *   **If Market Price < \$55.96:** The market may be overly concerned about the short-term macroeconomic headwinds (tariffs, high interest rates, weak demand), which are reflected in the low FY2026 and FY2027 net income margins used in this model. The market could also be factoring in a risk premium related to the execution of the merger or a conservative view on the actual realization of expected merger synergies.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated conservative **Fair Value of \$55.96 per share** for the standalone American Woodmark is justified by the conservative projections: a sharp, short-term earnings decline (FY2026), a slow recovery, and a low perpetual growth rate (2.0%). Any significant deviation of the current market price is most likely explained by the market's assessment of the announced merger with MasterBrand, Inc., which fundamentally alters the company's future earnings power and risk profile.
