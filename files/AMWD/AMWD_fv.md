The valuation of American Woodmark Corporation (AMWD) stock is performed using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on a conservative projection of the company as a standalone entity through Fiscal Year 2030.

The primary divergence between the calculated fair value and the current market price is addressed by the pending merger with MasterBrand, Inc. (MBC), which is expected to close in early Fiscal Year 2026. This DCF model fundamentally values AMWD as a going concern, while the market price likely reflects the terms and premium associated with the pending acquisition.

### 2. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projections (FY2026 - FY2030)

AMWD's business engine is driven by two main segments, both highly sensitive to macroeconomic factors (interest rates, consumer confidence, and housing starts):
1.  **New Construction (NC):** Approximately $43.5\%$ of FY2025 net sales. Highly correlated with single-family housing starts.
2.  **Repair & Remodel (R&R):** Approximately $56.6\%$ of FY2025 net sales (Home Centers at $40.8\%$ and Independent Dealers at $15.8\%$). Driven by existing home sales and home equity/consumer liquidity.

**Management Commentary and Conservative Assumptions:**
*   **FY2026 Guidance:** Management declined to provide updated guidance due to the pending merger, but the previous outlook was a "low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase". Q1 FY2026 net sales were down $12.2\%$.
*   **Business Outlook:** The market is "weaker than expected" in both NC and R\&R.
*   **Conservative Projection Engine:**
    *   **FY2026 (Continued Weakness):** I assume the conservative end of their original guidance, adjusted for the Q1 decline. A **$-2.0\%$** decline, reflecting continued high interest rates and soft R&R demand, despite expected Q2 recovery.
    *   **FY2027 (Market Rebound):** Assumes a recovery in the housing market and R&R spending due to normalization of interest rates. **$+4.0\%$** growth.
    *   **FY2028-FY2030 (Long-Term Stability):** A mature, cyclical industry player will eventually grow in-line with or slightly above long-term GDP/inflation. A conservative **$+2.5\%$** for FY2028 and **$+2.0\%$** for FY2029 and FY2030.

#### Revenue Projection Table (USD Millions)

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Actual)** | $1,709.6$ | $-7.5\%$ | Company reported Net Sales. |
| **FY2026 (Projection)** | $1,675.4$ | $-2.0\%$ | Conservative end of original management guidance, factoring in Q1 weakness and market uncertainty. |
| **FY2027 (Projection)** | $1,742.4$ | $+4.0\%$ | Assumes a market/cyclical rebound after the downturn. |
| **FY2028 (Projection)** | $1,786.0$ | $+2.5\%$ | Stabilized growth with moderate housing market recovery. |
| **FY2029 (Projection)** | $1,821.7$ | $+2.0\%$ | Long-term conservative growth rate. |
| **FY2030 (Projection)** | $1,858.1$ | $+2.0\%$ | Long-term conservative growth rate. |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

*   **Net Income Margin:** Q1 FY2026 margin fell significantly to $3.6\%$ due to a value-based product mix shift, tariffs, and increased interest/ERP costs. The company also expects $\sim \$5M-\$6M$ annual EBITDA savings from a facility closure.
*   **Conservative Assumptions:**
    *   **FY2026:** I assume a conservative $\mathbf{4.0\%}$ margin, reflecting the full-year impact of cost headwinds (tariffs, interest) and softer volumes, partially offset by savings and an expected better second half.
    *   **FY2027 - FY2030:** I assume an improvement to a stable $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ Net Income Margin, which is close to but slightly above the FY2025 level and reflects the company's focus on operational excellence and "Platform Design".

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):**
    *   The company operates in the cyclical housing/building products industry.
    *   A conservative but reasonable discount rate of $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ is used to reflect the business cycle risk and the high interest rate environment.
2.  **ROIC (Reinvestment Rate):**
    *   Historical TTM ROIC is $5.19\%$. A conservative $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ is used for the additional income from cash reinvestment.
    *   *Additional Income* for next year = (Net Income from previous year) * ROIC.
3.  **Terminal Growth Rate (g):**
    *   A very conservative long-term growth rate of $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ is assumed, slightly below expected long-term inflation/GDP, reflecting the maturity and cyclical nature of the industry and the conservative nature of the valuation.

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation Table (USD Millions)**

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | Add. Income from ROIC (B) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2025** | $1,709.6$ | $4.82\%$ | $82.4$ | - | $82.4$ | $0.909$ | $74.9$ |
| **FY2026** | $1,675.4$ | $4.00\%$ | $67.0$ | $4.1$ | $71.1$ | $0.826$ | $58.7$ |
| **FY2027** | $1,742.4$ | $5.00\%$ | $87.1$ | $3.4$ | $90.5$ | $0.751$ | $68.0$ |
| **FY2028** | $1,786.0$ | $5.00\%$ | $89.3$ | $4.5$ | $93.8$ | $0.683$ | $64.0$ |
| **FY2029** | $1,821.7$ | $5.00\%$ | $91.1$ | $4.7$ | $95.8$ | $0.621$ | $59.5$ |
| **FY2030** | $1,858.1$ | $5.00\%$ | $92.9$ | $4.8$ | $97.7$ | $0.564$ | $55.1$ |

**Terminal Value Calculation:**

*   **Terminal Cash Flow (FY2031):** $(Net Income_{2030} * (1 + g)) + (Net Income_{2030} * ROIC)$
    *   $Net Income_{2031} = 92.9 * (1 + 2.0\%) = \$94.8$ million
    *   $Add. Income_{2031} = 92.9 * 5.0\% = \$4.6$ million
    *   $Total Terminal Cash Flow = \$99.4$ million
*   **Terminal Value (TV):** $TV = \text{Cash Flow}_{2031} / (WACC - g)$
    *   $TV = 99.4 / (10.0\% - 2.0\%) = 99.4 / 0.08 = \$1,242.5$ million
*   **Terminal Value NPV:** $TV_{NPV} = TV * \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
    *   $TV_{NPV} = 1,242.5 * 0.564 = \$700.8$ million

**Total Equity Value:**
$$ \text{Total NPV of Cash Flows (FY2025-2030)} = \$74.9 + \$58.7 + \$68.0 + \$64.0 + \$59.5 + \$55.1 = \mathbf{\$380.2 \text{ million}} $$
$$ \text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (FY2025-2030)} + \text{Terminal Value NPV} $$
$$ \text{Total Equity Value} = \$380.2 \text{ million} + \$700.8 \text{ million} = \mathbf{\$1,081.0 \text{ million}} $$

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Equity Value (NPV of Cash Flows) | $1,081.0$ |
| **Add:** Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $54.9$ |
| **Subtract:** Total Debt | $370.0$ |
| **Net Fair Market Value of Equity** | $\mathbf{\$765.9 \text{ million}}$ |
| Shares Outstanding (Diluted) | $14.97 \text{ million}$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\mathbf{\$51.16}$ |

---

### Conclusion and Justification

**Calculated Fair Value Per Share:** **\$51.16**

**Current Stock Price:** **\$64.71**

The calculated Fair Value of $\mathbf{\$51.16}$ is $\mathbf{20.9\%}$ *lower* than the current market price of $\$64.71$.

**Justification for Divergence:**

The primary reason for the significant divergence between the calculated standalone DCF valuation and the current market price is the pending merger with **MasterBrand, Inc. (MBC)**, which is expected to close in early Fiscal Year 2026.

1.  **Market's Merger Premium:** The market price of $\$64.71$ is highly likely reflecting a **merger premium**. Acquisitions often occur at a price per share above the target company's standalone, intrinsic value, providing immediate value to shareholders. The market is assuming the merger will close, and the offer price (which may involve a cash-out, stock swap, or a combination) is higher than the standalone DCF value. The company even halted providing forward-looking guidance due to the pending merger.
2.  **Conservative DCF Assumptions:** The valuation is intentionally conservative as per the rules:
    *   A high $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ Discount Rate (WACC) was used, reflecting the company's cyclical risk and the current uncertain market for building products.
    *   Revenue growth for FY2026 was projected at a conservative $\mathbf{-2.0\%}$ decline, reflecting the "weaker than expected" Q1 FY2026 results and market trends.
    *   The long-term growth rate ($\mathbf{2.0\%}$) is very conservative, assuming a mature, slow-growth environment post-rebound.
3.  **Market's Optimism on Operational Upside:** The market may be placing a higher value on:
    *   The synergistic benefits and cost savings that the **MasterBrand merger** is expected to unlock, which are not modeled in this standalone DCF.
    *   A faster or more robust recovery in the New Construction and R\&R markets than the $\mathbf{4.0\%}$ growth used for FY2027.
    *   A higher sustainable net income margin (the market may project margins above the $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ used here, perhaps closer to or above the historical peak) due to the $\$5M-\$6M$ in cost savings and operational improvements.

**Conclusion:** The $\mathbf{\$51.16}$ Fair Value represents the intrinsic value of **American Woodmark Corporation as a conservative, standalone entity in a cyclical, mature industry.** The market's higher price of $\$64.71$ is a clear indication that investors are pricing in a successful closing of the merger with MasterBrand at a valuation higher than AMWD's intrinsic value, likely due to a cash/share offer that includes a premium.
