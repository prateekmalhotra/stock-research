## Business Summary

Under Armour makes money by designing, marketing, and selling specialized athletic clothing, footwear, and accessories, focusing on performance and innovation. The company sells its products primarily to athletes and active individuals globally, with the largest concentration of sales currently coming from North America. Their core business model involves selling goods through two main channels: directly to consumers via their own websites and branded stores (Direct-to-Consumer), and indirectly by selling products in bulk to large retailers and sporting goods chains (Wholesale). Apparel constitutes the majority of their revenue, followed by shoes and accessories.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is intense competition, particularly from larger rivals and newer fashion-focused brands. If Under Armour fails to quickly introduce popular or technologically advanced products, especially in the crucial footwear category, consumers will switch brands, immediately harming sales and market share. This has happened previously when the company struggled to adapt to changing athleisure trends, leading to excessive unsold inventory and profit losses. Currently, the company also faces risks related to inflation and supply chain disruptions, which increase the cost of producing goods and cut into the profit earned from each sale. Long-term risks center on brand health and differentiation; if the brand loses its distinct focus on performance or fails to successfully expand its presence globally beyond its reliance on the U.S. market, its overall growth potential and ability to charge premium prices will be severely limited.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the journey of Under Armour, Inc. (UA) from its founding idea to the global sports brand it is today.

### The Inception (1996) and Founding Goal

1.  **The Founder and the Problem:** Under Armour was founded in 1996 by Kevin Plank, a former college football player for the University of Maryland. His frustration was simple: the cotton t-shirts he and his teammates wore under their pads would quickly become heavy, soaked with sweat, and uncomfortable during games and practice.

2.  **The Innovative Solution:** Plank set out to create a better undershirt made from a synthetic, moisture-wicking fabric that would pull sweat away from the body and keep athletes dry, cool, and light. This innovative material was the company’s first product, which was named **HeatGear**.

3.  **The Business Goal:** The fundamental goal was to revolutionize athletic performance apparel, starting with the simple t-shirt, by engineering gear that would help athletes "Make Athletes Better" through technological fabrics.

### Early Tailwinds and Rapid Growth

4.  **Early Validation (1997-1999):** Plank started the company from his grandmother's basement, funding it with savings and credit card debt. The concept proved successful among athletes, and the brand secured its first major sale to the Georgia Tech football team.

5.  **A Big Break (1999):** The company received a major boost in brand visibility when its products were prominently featured in the Oliver Stone film *Any Given Sunday*, which showcased football stars and Hollywood actors wearing Under Armour gear.

6.  **Product Line Expansion:** Following the success of HeatGear for warm weather, the company introduced **ColdGear** in 1999, which was designed to keep athletes warm and dry in cold conditions, solidifying their reputation as a performance-focused brand.

7.  **Going Mainstream (2003-2005):** Under Armour launched its first national television commercial, "Protect This House," which increased public awareness. This period of rapid growth culminated in the company’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005.

8.  **Footwear Entry (2006) and Endorsements:** The company strategically expanded into the massive footwear market, starting with football cleats, an area largely ignored by major competitors. They continued to gain traction by signing major athlete endorsements, such as with quarterback Tom Brady and basketball player Stephen Curry, which helped them break \$1 billion in annual sales by 2010.

### Headwinds (Problems) and Strategic Solutions

9.  **The Athleisure Challenge (Mid-2010s):** A major market shift, the rise of "athleisure" (comfortable athletic wear worn as everyday fashion), began to emerge. Under Armour struggled to keep pace, as its brand was heavily focused on serious, hardcore athletic performance, making it less appealing for casual fashion use compared to rivals.

10. **Financial and Strategic Missteps:** After reaching a peak valuation around 2015, the company faced a dramatic decline due to strategic overexpansion and heavy investment in areas like digital acquisitions that did not yield expected results. This led to financial pressure and operational challenges.

11. **Intense Competition and Product Dilution:** As the brand grew, it faced fierce competition from industry giants like Nike and Adidas. The push into footwear and lifestyle apparel, while necessary for growth, sometimes risked diluting the core brand identity of being strictly a performance-first company.

12. **Innovative Solutions and Modern Strategy:** In response to these headwinds, Under Armour has focused on several key strategies:
    *   **Digital Transformation:** The company accelerated its investment in e-commerce and digital channels to reach consumers directly, a crucial move during and after the global pandemic.
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** They worked to improve cost management and operational processes, ensuring that investments resulted in high-quality revenue and improved profitability.
    *   **Diversification:** They have continued to diversify their product line beyond compression wear to include more lifestyle-focused items while maintaining a commitment to advanced materials and performance technology.

## Moat Analysis

Under Armour’s competitive advantage, or "moat," is often debated; while it achieved massive success by pioneering performance gear, its current position is challenged by much larger rivals. The business relies heavily on its brand strength and continuous innovation rather than having deep, structural advantages like its top competitors.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and strategic position:

### The Under Armour Moat Analysis

1.  **Brand as a Moat (The Original Strength):** The company's initial, powerful moat was its **Performance Brand Image**, differentiating itself by being exclusively for the serious athlete focused on function over fashion. This focus on "making athletes better" allowed it to build strong brand recognition and affinity among specific athletic groups, such as those in American football and training.

2.  **Product Differentiation (The Pioneer Edge):** Under Armour created a market by innovating moisture-wicking and temperature-regulating apparel, such as its famous **HeatGear** and **ColdGear** products. This proprietary fabric technology gave them a tangible, unique product that competitors did not have initially, which was the core reason for its explosive growth in its early years.

3.  **Pricing Power and Position:** The brand employs a **value-based, premium pricing strategy**, charging a higher price point based on the perceived value and advanced technology of its performance gear. While this allows for higher profit margins, it does not possess the same broad, strong pricing power as its larger competitors, and can struggle to appeal to budget-minded consumers.

4.  **The Reason for Growth (1996–2016):** The initial, rapid growth was driven by its bold focus on a niche (performance apparel instead of cotton t-shirts), strategic partnerships with high-profile athletes, and its marketing story that resonated with an "underdog" mentality. This allowed it to pass Adidas in North American sales at one point.

5.  **Vulnerability to Displacement:** The company is significantly vulnerable to displacement because its main rivals, like Nike and Adidas, have **greater financial resources, broader distribution, longer operating histories, and better overall brand recognition** globally. The athletic apparel market is highly competitive, and having less capital and fewer economies of scale makes it difficult for Under Armour to sustain market share against these giants.

6.  **Customer and Contract Stickiness (The Push for Recurring Revenue):** Historically, customer contracts have relied on brand loyalty which is not as sticky as true product lock-in. To increase stickiness and recurring engagement, Under Armour has:
    *   **Invested in Digital Ecosystems:** It acquired fitness apps like MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal to create one of the world's largest digital fitness communities, aiming for a network effect that keeps customers engaged with the brand beyond just buying apparel.
    *   **Launched a Loyalty Program:** The company recently launched "UA Rewards" (in 2023) to offer exclusive benefits like early access to products and member-only content, which is a key strategy for improving customer retention and repeat purchases.

7.  **Network Effects and Other Advantages:**
    *   **Weak Network Effect:** The network effect from its digital acquisitions, while initially promising, has not translated into a clear, dominant moat for its apparel business, as the performance apparel segment remains the core driver.
    *   **Trademark Advantage:** The company holds registered trademarks globally, including its key product lines (like HEATGEAR and COLDGEAR), which provides a legal barrier against direct product copying.

8.  **Innovation and R&D (The Necessary Edge):** Yes, the company must constantly innovate to maintain its competitive edge. Its core business relies on continuous **product innovation** in fabrics and designs to justify its premium pricing and differentiate its offerings from fast-followers. The company has an innovation center, UA Lighthouse, dedicated to developing cutting-edge materials and manufacturing best practices.

## Catalyst Analysis

This analysis of Under Armour, Inc. (UA/UAA) catalysts is based on recent news, press releases, and transcripts from the Q2 2025, Q4 2024, and Q3 2024 earnings calls.

## Under Armour, Inc. (UA) Catalysts

### Near-Term Catalysts (12-18 Months)

1.  **Improved Profitability from Brand Reset:** Management is focused on increasing gross margin by pulling back on high promotions and discounts in their Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business. This strategy, combined with product cost savings and lower freight costs, has already resulted in better-than-expected gross margins in recent quarters.
2.  **Financial Stability and Shareholder Return:** A new three-year, \$500 million share buyback program was approved, and the company ended fiscal year 2024 with a strong cash position and no borrowings. This use of capital can support the stock price.
3.  **Leaner Operations and Inventory:** The company has been actively reducing inventory, which was down 19% at the end of fiscal year 2024, and expects to incur restructuring charges to streamline the business for long-term efficiency.
4.  **Strengthened Leadership Focus:** The return of founder Kevin Plank as CEO and the appointment of new, experienced executives to lead product and brand strategy aim to sharpen the company's focus and improve execution.

### Long-Term Catalysts (2+ Years)

1.  **Brand Reconstitution and Premium Positioning:** Management's overarching strategy is to "reconstitute the Under Armour brand" by emphasizing product quality, innovation, and compelling consumer storytelling. A major part of this plan is a new, significant marketing effort planned for 2025 to amplify the brand.
2.  **Product Line Focus and Innovation:** The company is intentionally reducing its product count (SKUs) by about 25% to focus resources on higher-quality, better-segmented products, particularly in men's apparel. Success in new product launches, especially in footwear, is key to regaining market share.
3.  **International Growth Outperformance:** The international business, particularly in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions, has historically shown growth and is expected to maintain its momentum, offsetting challenges in North America.
4.  **Successful North American Turnaround:** The North American market is currently facing challenges, but management views driving US sales as a strategic priority under the "Protect This House 3" strategy. A definitive rebound in its largest and most challenging market would be the most significant long-term catalyst.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy

Management has explicitly stated that the **catalysts** for future success are driven by focusing on three areas: **Product, Brand, and Commercial execution** (sales).

*   **Product:** The strategy involves a "significanty strengthened product lineup coming in Fall 2025," driven by increased innovation and improved design language, with a focus on men's apparel.
*   **Brand:** Management is investing in **marketing and brand-building** to create an "underdog brand positioning" and deepen the connection with consumers to drive brand heat.
*   **Commercial:** The company is implementing "purposeful, disciplined marketplace management," which includes reducing promotional activity and streamlining its business to drive a more premium brand perception.
*   **Fiscal Year 2025:** Management is framing this year as a period of building and resetting, expecting revenue declines as they clean up the business, but anticipating improved gross margins and investing for the long term.

## Management Record

This analysis summarizes the management of Under Armour, Inc. (UA) with a focus on details relevant to an investor, based on publicly available information.

### **I. Current CEO, History, and Performance Track Record**

1.  **Founder's Return:** The current President and CEO is founder **Kevin A. Plank**, who officially returned to the role in April 2024, having previously served as CEO from the company's founding in 1996 until 2019.
2.  **Early Success and Track Record:** Under Plank's original tenure, he grew Under Armour into a $5 billion business, pioneering the moisture-wicking apparel category and successfully taking the company public in 2005.
3.  **Shareholder Value Delivery:** Despite its initial success, Under Armour's share price is only about 33% higher than its 2005 IPO price, having peaked in 2015; this underperformance has led to proxy advisory firms recommending votes against Plank and other long-standing directors.
4.  **Key Strategic Mistakes (Pre-2019):** Under Plank’s initial leadership, the company faced significant growth slowdowns beginning around 2017, partially due to missing the crucial athleisure trend and a perceived over-reliance on the "performance" segment.
5.  **Board Leadership:** Economist **Mohamed A. El-Erian** was appointed the non-executive Chair of the Board in April 2024; he is a respected finance figure who also served as CEO of PIMCO.
6.  **Insider Ownership/Control:** Kevin Plank remains a top individual shareholder with significant stock ownership, which gives him substantial voting rights and control over the company's strategy.

### **II. Management Stability and Transitions**

7.  **High CEO Turnover:** Since Plank first stepped down in 2019, Under Armour has experienced significant leadership instability with three CEO changes in four years, which has unsettled investors and contributed to a negative stock reaction upon Plank's latest return.
8.  **Patrik Frisk (2020-2022):** Frisk, who was previously COO, was praised for improving operational efficiency and executing a multi-year restructuring, but he exited after just two years, with market speculation that his focus on fundamentals did not align with Plank's desire for aggressive growth.
9.  **Stephanie Linnartz (2023-2024):** The former Marriott executive focused on profitability and strengthened the leadership team with new hires and the launch of the UA Rewards loyalty program, but she stepped down abruptly after only 13 months.
10. **The "Difficult Culture":** Analysts suggest that Under Armour is a "very difficult company to lead," still retaining the founder's distinct DNA and views, which makes it challenging for external CEOs to take the reins effectively.

### **III. Future Strategy and Vision**

13. **Product and Brand Focus:** The strategy involves streamlining the product assortment, investing heavily in innovation with a "significantly strengthened product lineup" expected in Fall 2025, and leveraging the brand's "underdog positioning."
14. **Marketplace Management:** In the Americas, the plan is to "reset and strengthen" the brand by moving towards a more premium representation and implementing disciplined marketplace management with optimized promotional levels.
15. **International Expansion:** The company plans to build on its success in the UK to expand into other key European markets (France, Germany, Spain) while navigating challenging dynamics in the APAC region.
16. **Management Popularity Concern:** Despite the clear strategy, employees rate the executive team a "C-" and in the bottom 30% compared to similar-sized companies, which may indicate internal alignment and execution challenges.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Under Armour, Inc.'s (UA) proxy statements, the management incentive and compensation structure provides a mixed, but highly controlled, incentive environment.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

**1. Insider Ownership and Voting Control (Founder's Role)**

*   **Founder's Super-Voting Control:** The most significant factor is the company's dual-class stock structure, which grants the founder, Kevin Plank, approximately **65% of the total voting power** through his holdings of Class B common stock (which carries ten votes per share).
*   **Decoupled Economic and Voting Stake:** While his voting control is dominant, Mr. Plank's economic ownership (his total share of the company's equity) is significantly lower, representing approximately **12% of the company's stock** as of May 2023.
*   **Conclusion on Control:** This structure means Mr. Plank can effectively control all matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors and approval of the executive compensation plan, regardless of how the majority of public Class A shareholders vote, greatly reducing the direct influence of non-insider shareholders (higher the better principle is effectively muted by super-voting shares).

**2. Executive Compensation Structure (NEOs)**

*   **High Equity Component:** Executive compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs), including the CEO, is heavily weighted toward long-term incentive awards (equity), which aligns management's financial interests with long-term stock performance. For the CEO in FY 2025, the equity component was a large majority of the total compensation.
*   **Performance-Based Metrics:** The annual and long-term incentive awards are tied to key financial performance measures, including **Revenue**, **Operating Income Margin**, and **Return On Invested Capital (ROIC)**. This structure incentivizes management to focus on fundamental operational and capital efficiency improvements, which benefit shareholders.
*   **Director Compensation:** Non-employee directors also receive a portion of their compensation in the form of deferred stock units (Class C, non-voting stock), which encourages long-term equity holding and aligns their personal net worth with the company's stock value.

**3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

*   **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest (via Compensation Design):** The compensation structure, by linking the largest portion of pay to long-term equity and explicit financial performance metrics like Operating Income Margin and ROIC, *does* create a strong financial incentive for management to improve the company's fundamental performance and, consequently, its share price for all stockholders.
*   **Incentive to Line Own Pockets (via Governance Control):** The founder's super-voting majority ($65\%$) means that management is not directly accountable to the majority of the company's economic shareholders (the public Class A stockholders). This corporate governance structure effectively insulates the management team and founder from external pressure, and could potentially allow the founder's personal or long-term vision to override immediate shareholder demands or activist intervention.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** Management and directors have significant incentive to create shareholder value due to the large equity-based compensation and performance hurdles, but the founder's majority voting power means the decision-making authority and ultimate protection of the current management team are secured regardless of the concerns or votes of the non-insider economic majority.

## Price History

Based on current technical analysis and price data for Under Armour, Inc. (UA), here is an analysis of its recent price history and market standing.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Low Proximity:** The stock is trading very close to its 52-week low. Using the recent price of approximately \$4.61 and a 52-week low of \$4.56, Under Armour, Inc. (UA) is currently trading about **1.1%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis: Trading Low:** According to a widely used technical analysis platform, the stock is considered to be trading low. The overall technical rating is a "strong sell," and the prevailing trend across 1-week and 1-month periods is a "sell" signal.

3.  **Key Technical Indicators:** The moving averages (a common indicator of trend direction) also signal a "strong sell." However, some oscillators (which gauge if a stock is overbought or oversold) show a "neutral" signal, and there was an RSI alert indicating the stock was recently **oversold**.

4.  **Significant Drop in the Last Year:** The stock has experienced a major decline, with its price falling by approximately **-47.13%** over the last year.

5.  **Reason for Recent Price Pressure (Last Few Months):** A significant cause for recent drops was the disappointing **first-quarter fiscal 2026 results** reported in August 2025. The company's results and outlook caused analysts to slash their forecasts and prompted a downgrade from "Buy" to "Hold," citing weak demand and a challenging turnaround in North America.

6.  **Analyst Outlook:** The consensus price target from analysts suggests a potential upside of approximately 40.2% from the current price, indicating that while the stock is struggling, many analysts still see a pathway for significant appreciation from the depressed valuation.

## Long Thesis

Under Armour is currently undergoing a necessary operational reset led by its founder, Kevin Plank, which will lead to a more profitable and focused company long term. In the near term, the bull case rests on the company successfully cleaning up its inventory, cutting back on heavy discounts, and running the business more efficiently, which is already improving gross profit margins. Management is also using company cash to buy back shares, supporting the stock price during this rebuilding phase. In the long term (2025 and beyond), growth will be driven by a major wave of new, high-tech products designed to re-establish Under Armour as the leading premium performance brand. If they successfully release these innovative products and spend money to tell a better brand story, they can shift the public perception away from being a discounted brand, allowing them to charge higher prices. Furthermore, consistent expansion in international markets like Europe will reduce the company's reliance on the challenging North American market, driving stable, profitable global growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The new, innovative product lineup scheduled for late 2025 must be successful enough to attract consumers and justify premium pricing over competitors like Nike and Adidas. The founder, Kevin Plank, must execute this turnaround without further destabilizing the leadership team. The company must successfully transition back to being viewed as a premium performance brand, reducing its reliance on promotions without losing a significant portion of its current customer base. Finally, the difficult North American market must stabilize and stop declining to allow international growth to drive overall success.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the key flaws and risks in the bull case for Under Armour, Inc. (UA), focusing on execution, market realities, and the difficult shift in brand perception.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

| Long Thesis Point | Flaw / Risk Corroborated by Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Operational reset... will lead to a more profitable and focused company long term."** | **Top-Line Shrinkage is Severe and Protracted:** The operational reset is causing significant top-line decline, with revenue expected to be down at a low double-digit percentage rate for Fiscal Year 2025, including a projected decline of up to 17% in the key North American market. This suggests the "reset" is a deep contraction with a highly uncertain timeline for a return to meaningful growth. |
| **"Founder, Kevin Plank, must execute this turnaround without further destabilizing the leadership team."** | **Instability is Already a Structural Problem:** Plank's return in April 2024 makes him the fourth CEO in four years, which itself represents severe leadership destabilization and poor corporate governance. The founder's inability to hand off the reins suggests an ongoing executive risk that can derail long-term strategy. |
| **"Successfully cleaning up its inventory, cutting back on heavy discounts... improving gross profit margins."** | **Discounts are Still Fueling the Cleanup:** While gross margins are technically improving (e.g., 130 basis points increase in Q4 FY2024), this progress is partially driven by cost control and *partially offset* by selling through the off-price channel and increased promotional activities in direct-to-consumer sales to clear old stock. Continuing to rely on discounts to move inventory actively undermines the stated goal of shifting to a "premium brand." |
| **"Growth will be driven by a major wave of new, high-tech products... to re-establish... the leading premium performance brand."** | **Lack of Pricing Power and Differentiation:** Analysts are highly skeptical that the company can successfully transition to a "premium brand" that justifies higher prices against giants like Nike and Adidas. The brand is perceived as lacking the emotional connection and market differentiation to command premium pricing; for context, the average price of an Under Armour shoe is around $70, significantly lower than Nike's $110. |
| **"Consistent expansion in international markets... will reduce the company's reliance on the challenging North American market."** | **International Growth Insufficient to Offset North America:** Although international revenue is growing (e.g., 7% in Q4 FY2024), this growth is too small to compensate for the significant decline in North America, resulting in an overall revenue contraction. The international market is a contributor, but the reliance on a struggling core domestic market remains a massive impediment to total company growth. |
| **"Management is also using company cash to buy back shares, supporting the stock price..."** | **Buybacks Mask Underlying Business Weakness:** While share repurchases provide technical support for the stock, this capital allocation may be viewed as a temporary measure to prop up the price while the core business is actively shrinking, rather than as a sustainable driver of shareholder value. |

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Under Armour, Inc. (UA)**

1.  **Founder-Led Execution Risk and Governance Instability:** The return of Kevin Plank as CEO is a desperate measure that highlights a persistent failure in corporate governance and succession planning, as the company has cycled through multiple CEOs in a very short period. This instability, rather than being a stabilizing force, adds execution risk to the most critical stage of the turnaround, especially since Plank's original tenure coincided with the brand's shift into heavy discounting.
2.  **Unrealistic "Premium" Brand Pivot in a Weak Market:** The core long-term strategy of shedding the "discounted brand" perception and charging higher prices is fundamentally flawed, given Under Armour's current weak brand equity and product differentiation compared to established premium rivals like Nike and Adidas. Attempting to force a price-increase without proven, commercially successful, high-tech product lines (e.g., the late 2025 lineup) risks alienating the existing price-sensitive customer base without attracting new, high-value consumers.
3.  **Revenue Contraction and Financial Headwinds:** The pivot is resulting in a painful, multi-year decline in top-line revenue, with Fiscal Year 2025 revenue projected to decline at a low double-digit rate, led by an expected steep drop in North America revenue. This deep contraction signals a difficult road ahead where the margin gains from lower freight costs and expense control are being overshadowed by a dwindling customer base and a shrinking addressable market share.
4.  **North America Market Collapse:** The company's reliance on North America remains a critical risk, as the market is not stabilizing but actively declining, with projected drops as steep as 17%. The relatively modest international growth (around 7%) is insufficient to offset the rapid deterioration of the core domestic business, indicating that the global diversification strategy is failing to deliver overall company stability.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the next phase of investigation should focus on turning the qualitative claims of the bull case (premium product, undervaluation) into quantitative, verifiable facts and thoroughly stress-testing the major governance and execution risks.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further:

### Next Steps to Investigate

1.  **Anchor Valuation with Current Peer Metrics:**
    *   **Question:** What are the current forward-looking valuation multiples (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA) for Under Armour (UA) and how do they *currently* compare to Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY)?
    *   *Goal:* Determine if the stock is trading at a significant discount that justifies the turnaround risk, or if its current low valuation is simply a fair reflection of its poor growth and high execution risk.

2.  **Validate the "Fall 2025 Product Lineup" Catalyst:**
    *   **Question:** What are the specific, named product lines, material technologies, or athlete-driven endorsements planned for the "significant strengthened product lineup" in late 2025/early 2026?
    *   *Goal:* The bull case is entirely dependent on this product success. Investigate recent Investor Day presentations or analyst notes for *commercial details* beyond general statements to assess the tangible innovation.

3.  **Determine the True Cause of Footwear Failure:**
    *   **Question:** Why did Footwear revenue drop 14% in the latest quarter? Is it due to poor product design, a lack of popular athlete endorsements (post-Curry), or an inability to compete with rivals' running/lifestyle models?
    *   *Goal:* Footwear is a crucial, high-growth, high-margin category. Understanding the specific failure point in this segment is key to evaluating the likelihood of the 2025 rebound.

4.  **Drill Down on International Growth Specifics:**
    *   **Question:** Why is the strong growth in EMEA (up 10% in Q1 FY2026) being completely offset by steep declines in Asia-Pacific (down 10%) and Latin America (down 15%)?
    *   *Goal:* Investigate the specific challenges in the APAC region (e.g., China strategy, retail partner bankruptcies) to determine if the international catalyst is resilient or fragile.

5.  **Stress-Test Governance and Founder Control:**
    *   **Question:** Is there any current, active opposition from major institutional shareholders or proxy advisory firms (like ISS or Glass Lewis) against Kevin Plank's return and his super-voting Class B share control?
    *   *Goal:* The founder's governance power is the largest long-term bear risk. Investigate recent news to see if external pressure could force a change in the dual-class share structure or better management accountability.
