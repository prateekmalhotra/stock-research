## Business Summary

Erasca operates as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing novel cancer treatments. The company's core business model is not based on current product sales, but on research and development (R&D), where it spends investor capital to advance potential drugs through multi-year clinical trials. If a drug is successfully developed and approved by regulatory bodies, the company expects to generate revenue by selling the specialized treatment to healthcare providers, such as hospitals and oncologists (their B2B customers), mainly in developed global markets, or by licensing the drug rights to larger pharmaceutical partners in exchange for milestone payments and royalties. Since they have no approved medicines, their current revenue is minimal.

## Business Model Risk

The primary and most immediate risk for Erasca, typical of early-stage biotechs, is clinical failure, meaning the experimental drugs may prove ineffective or unsafe during human trials. Since these trials are very expensive, a failure in a late-stage trial can instantly deplete investor capital, causing significant harm to earnings and market position. A long-term threat is the intense competition in oncology; larger, established pharmaceutical companies often have vast R&D budgets, meaning a competitor could release a superior or cheaper treatment first, rendering Erasca’s pipeline less valuable. Furthermore, as the company currently generates no product revenue, it constantly relies on securing new capital from investors to fund its operations (financing risk), a threat magnified during poor economic conditions. Historically, the vast majority of drugs entering development never reach the market, making continued high-cost investment without guaranteed success the central business danger.

## Company History

Erasca, Inc. (ERAS) is a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on developing new medicines for cancers driven by a particular signaling pathway. The company's name is a portmanteau of its mission: **"To Eradicate RAS-driven CAncer"** and "To ERASe CAncer."

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history of Erasca, Inc. from its inception to the present:

### **I. Inception and Founding (The Why and The Mission)**

1.  **The Founding:** Erasca was officially co-founded in July 2018 by Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., and world-renowned biochemist Dr. Kevan Shokat, in San Diego, California.
2.  **The Core Problem and Why The Business Was Founded:** The company was created to tackle one of the most difficult problems in cancer: the **RAS protein** and the associated **MAPK pathway**.
3.  **The RAS/MAPK Pathway (Simplified):** Think of the RAS/MAPK pathway as a crucial chain of proteins inside a cell that acts as a signal cascade. It communicates a signal from the cell's surface to its nucleus, essentially telling the cell to grow, divide, and survive.
4.  **The Cancer Problem:** In many cancers, the RAS protein—often called the "master regulator"—is mutated. This mutation is like an "on-off switch" getting permanently stuck in the "on" position, which causes the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.
5.  **The Unmet Need:** RAS mutations are the most frequently mutated cancer-causing gene in human tumors, affecting approximately 5.5 million new patients globally each year. For decades, RAS was considered "undruggable" because its structure made it extremely difficult for drugs to bind and shut it off. Erasca was founded with a disruptive, novel idea to drug this target.

### **II. Tailwinds and Key Milestones**

1.  **Early Investor Confidence (Tailwind):** Within its first few years, Erasca was able to attract significant financial backing, which is a major tailwind for any biotech company.
2.  **Significant Funding Rounds:** In 2020, the company closed a \$200 million Series B funding round, quickly followed by a \$300 million Series C in 2021. This capital gave them the essential resources needed to move their initial drug candidates out of the lab and into clinical trials.
3.  **Public Market Launch (IPO):** Erasca completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq in 2021, raising approximately \$345 million. This further strengthened its financial stability, enabling broader clinical development across multiple drug programs.
4.  **Strategic Acquisitions:** The company has supplemented its internal discoveries by in-licensing or acquiring existing assets, such as naporafenib (a Phase 3 clinical candidate), allowing them to rapidly advance their pipeline and target different parts of the cancer pathway.

### **III. Problems, Headwinds, and Innovative Solutions**

1.  **The Core Headwind (Drug Resistance):** A major challenge in targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway is that cancer cells are "wily"; they often develop resistance to a single drug by finding "escape routes" to keep the growth signal turned on.
2.  **The Innovative Solution (MAPKlamp™):** Erasca's core innovation is its strategic approach called "MAPKlamp." The idea is that treating cancer requires hitting the pathway at multiple points simultaneously to prevent the cancer from escaping.
3.  **The Three-Pronged Strategy:** Their pipeline is purposefully built around three therapeutic strategies to "comprehensively shut down" the pathway:
    *   **Targeting Upstream and Downstream:** Using drugs to hit the proteins that send the signal before and after the central RAS switch.
    *   **Targeting RAS Directly:** Developing new drugs to directly turn off the RAS protein itself.
    *   **Targeting Escape Routes:** Creating drugs to block the secondary pathways that cancer uses when it becomes resistant to the main treatment.
4.  **The High-Risk Headwind (Cost of Clinical Trials):** Developing drugs is a very long, expensive, and risky process, requiring continuous, substantial funding. A drug can fail at any stage, consuming billions of dollars.
5.  **Dealing with Headwinds (Strategic Prioritization):** In 2023 and 2024, Erasca performed a "strategic pipeline review" to manage its financial resources effectively. It made the tough decision to pause or de-prioritize some of its earlier programs.
6.  **The Result:** By focusing their money and organizational effort on the most competitive, high-potential programs—its new "RAS-Targeting Franchise" (like ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001)—Erasca extended its projected cash reserves, known as the "cash runway," further into the future (into the second half of 2028). This move ensures they can focus on achieving major success with a smaller, but highly-targeted, group of promising medicines.

## Moat Analysis

Erasca, Inc. (ERAS) is a **clinical-stage precision oncology company**, meaning its moat is built primarily on its unique scientific strategy, intellectual property, and the successful development of its pipeline, rather than immediate sales or customer contracts.

Here is an analysis of Erasca's competitive advantages (moat) and differentiating factors.

### The Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Singular Focus on the RAS/MAPK Pathway:** Erasca’s primary differentiation is its **singular, aggressive focus** on the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is one of the most frequently mutated pathways across many cancers, affecting millions of patients globally. This focus allows the company to become a deep specialist in a complex and high-unmet-need area of oncology.
2.  **"Comprehensive Shutdown" Pipeline Strategy:** The company's goal is to **comprehensively shut down** the entire RAS/MAPK pathway, not just hit one target. Its pipeline is purposefully designed to target the pathway at multiple points: upstream, downstream, and directly at the RAS protein itself, as well as targeting the 'escape routes' cancer cells develop to become resistant to treatment.
3.  **Differentiated Product Candidates:**
    *   The lead candidate, **Naporafenib** (a pan-RAF inhibitor), is in a pivotal Phase 3 trial for NRASm melanoma. This is a critical area, as there are **no approved targeted therapies** for this specific type of cancer, giving Erasca a potential "first-in-class" market position and a significant advantage if approved.
    *   They are developing novel drugs like a **pan-RAS molecular glue (ERAS-0015)**, which uses a new mechanism to prevent RAS signaling, showing strong preclinical potency. This approach is designed to treat a broader range of RAS-mutant tumors beyond just the common KRAS G12C mutation.
4.  **Intellectual Property and Licensing:** The primary legal moat is its **owned and in-licensed patent portfolio** protecting its novel drug molecules, their compositions, and their use in combination regimens. They have strategically licensed key preclinical programs, such as ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001, to quickly assemble what they believe is the deepest pipeline in the industry targeting this pathway.

### Market Position, Pricing Power, and Customer Stickiness

1.  **Pricing Power and Special Market Position:** Since Erasca is a clinical-stage company with no commercial products, it has **no current pricing power or contracts**. Its future power hinges on two factors:
    *   **Clinical Success:** If their drugs are approved and show significantly better efficacy or safety than competitors, especially in cancers with few treatment options (like NRASm melanoma), they can command a premium price.
    *   **First-in-Class Designation:** Achieving a "first-in-class" or "best-in-class" label, particularly for high-unmet-need indications, would immediately grant them a special market position and strong pricing power.
2.  **Customer Stickiness and Contracts:** The business **does not have sticky or recurring customer contracts** in the traditional sense. Its future "customers" are cancer patients and the doctors who treat them. Patient/physician loyalty in oncology is based entirely on a drug's efficacy and safety data compared to all other treatment options. Prescriptions are recurring for the duration of the patient’s treatment, but loyalty to the company is non-existent; they will switch to a better drug if one becomes available.

### Investment in Moat and Displacement Risk

1.  **Heavy Investment in R&D and Innovation:** Erasca invests heavily in Research and Development, with R&D expenses totaling **$115.4 million for the full year 2024**. This massive, consistent investment is their only way to maintain an edge, as their competitive advantage is *entirely* based on the next drug they discover or develop.
2.  **Need for Constant Innovation:** The company **must constantly innovate** because of the nature of cancer itself, which develops resistance to single-agent therapies. Their multi-pronged pipeline is a direct answer to this need for continuous innovation to combat resistance. They have already had to restructure their pipeline and deprioritize certain programs due to the "increasingly competitive landscape," which proves the relentless need to stay ahead.
3.  **Displacement Risk by More Capital:** **The risk of displacement is high** and continuous. The oncology space is highly competitive, featuring both large pharmaceutical companies and other well-funded biotechs (like Revolution Medicines) also focused on the RAS pathway. A company with more capital could:
    *   Outspend Erasca on late-stage clinical trials.
    *   Develop a superior or similar drug that circumvents Erasca’s patents.
    *   Accelerate development timelines and beat Erasca to market with a more effective compound.
4.  **Moat-Building Activities:** To proactively build its moat, Erasca has:
    *   **Assembled a "Pioneering" Team:** Co-founded by leading pioneers in precision oncology and RAS targeting.
    *   **Built a Strategic Pipeline:** Used a mixture of internal discovery and in-licensing to gain access to novel molecules and intellectual property, rather than just relying on internal capacity.
    *   **Created an Ecosystem:** Established **Erasca Ventures** to make equity investments in early-stage biotech companies that align with their mission, potentially giving them a first look at new, complementary technology.
5.  **Network Effects:** Erasca does **not have a traditional network effect** where the value of the product increases with the number of users (like a social media platform). However, its strategy of creating a *comprehensive* product portfolio (a "pipeline of combinations") to shut down the entire pathway creates an internal network effect: the success of one drug in combination with another Erasca drug increases the value of the entire franchise and their position in the market.

## Catalyst Analysis

Here is an analysis of the catalysts for Erasca, Inc. (ERAS).

### Near-Term Catalysts (Within the next 12-18 months)

1.  **Phase 3 Data for Naporafenib:** Expected in the second half of 2025 are the randomized data from Stage 1 of the SEACRAFT-2 Phase 3 trial for naporafenib in combination with trametinib for patients with NRAS-mutant (NRASm) melanoma.
2.  **Potential Partnership for Naporafenib:** Following a strategic decision, the company is evaluating potential partnership opportunities for naporafenib, which could lead to an upfront payment and future milestone payments if a deal is announced.
3.  **Advancement of New RAS Programs:** The company recently received U.S. FDA clearance to begin Phase 1 clinical trials for two of its wholly-owned programs: ERAS-0015 (pan-RAS molecular glue) and ERAS-4001 (pan-KRAS inhibitor), marking their entry into the clinic.

### Long-Term Catalysts (18 months and beyond)

1.  **Initial Clinical Data for RAS-Targeting Franchise:** Initial Phase 1 monotherapy data for both ERAS-0015 (AURORAS-1 trial) and ERAS-4001 (BOREALIS-1 trial) are expected in 2026. Positive early data would validate the company's strategy of developing "best-in-class" pan-RAS/KRAS therapies.
2.  **Potential First-to-Market Designation:** The registrational trial for naporafenib in NRASm melanoma has been granted FDA Fast Track Designation, which, if successful, offers the potential to be the first approved targeted therapy for this area of high unmet medical need.
3.  **Financial Stability for Clinical Execution:** The company has a strong cash position, which is expected to fund operations into the second half of 2028, significantly reducing the near-term risk of needing to raise more capital.

### Management's Stated Catalysts and Strategy

*   **Core Mission and Focus:** CEO Jonathan Lim states that their name, "Erasca," is their mission: to erase cancer, and they are singularly focused on shutting down the **RAS/MAPK pathway** with single-agent and combination approaches.
*   **Key Value Drivers for 2025 and Beyond:** Management explicitly highlighted that they have an "exciting year ahead focused on shutting down RAS" and expect multiple value drivers in 2025 and beyond, specifically mentioning the Stage 1 randomized data from SEACRAFT-2.
*   **Prioritizing the RAS Franchise:** Management expressed "high enthusiasm" for the RAS-targeting franchise (ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001), noting the substantial opportunities for both candidates in major cancer types like colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers due to the high prevalence of RAS/KRAS alterations.
*   **Naporafenib's Market Potential:** Management stressed that the naporafenib combination, with its Fast Track Designation, has the potential to be a "first-to-market" treatment in NRASm melanoma, an area with no approved targeted therapies.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Erasca, Inc.'s (ERAS) Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) filed in April 2025 (covering 2024 executive compensation), the management incentives appear to be strongly aligned with the long-term interests of the shareholders.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Erasca, Inc. (ERAS)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership (Alignment Indicator: Higher the Better)**

*   **Founder-Led Ownership:** The Chairman, CEO, and Co-Founder, Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., is a significant beneficial owner of Erasca. He is also the Managing Partner and Founder of City Hill Ventures, which is a founding investor in Erasca and holds shares for which Dr. Lim exercises voting and dispositive control.
*   **Conclusion on Ownership:** While the precise *group percentage* for all directors and executive officers is not explicitly available, the company's history as a venture-backed, founder-led organization with the CEO maintaining control over an affiliated investment entity suggests a high degree of personal and vested ownership interest, which is a strong positive for long-term alignment.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure (2024 Fiscal Year)**

*   **Heavy Equity Focus:** The compensation philosophy is significantly weighted toward long-term incentive (LTI) equity awards over fixed pay (salary and cash bonus).
*   **CEO Compensation Mix (Dr. Lim - 2024):** The vast majority of the CEO's reported total compensation for 2024 was derived from equity. For example, of the total compensation of approximately \$3.9 million, roughly 81.3% was composed of stock option awards.
*   **Incentive Components:** The structure is composed of three primary elements:
    1.  **Base Salary:** A fixed component to provide a competitive baseline.
    2.  **Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation:** A cash bonus earned based on corporate performance relative to key corporate objectives, which are typically tied to clinical, regulatory, operational, and financial milestones.
    3.  **Option Awards (Long-Term Incentive):** The largest component, consisting of stock options, which generally vest over time (e.g., four years) and only provide value if the company's stock price increases beyond the grant price.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

*   **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest (Long-Term Focus):** The compensation structure is clearly designed to prioritize long-term shareholder value. The heavy reliance on stock options means that the NEOs' personal financial success is directly dependent on the sustained appreciation of Erasca's stock price, which aligns their interests with those of public shareholders.
*   **Risk of "Lining Pockets" (Low):** The low proportion of compensation from cash (salary and annual cash bonus) and the high proportion from long-term equity minimize the incentive for short-term, unsustainable actions, as the executives' primary financial benefit is tied to the successful long-term execution of the clinical and corporate strategy.

In conclusion, the incentive and compensation structure for Erasca, Inc. is highly oriented toward long-term shareholder value creation, leveraging stock options to ensure management profits only when the company's market value, and thus the shareholders' investment, increases.

## Long Thesis

Erasca aims to solve one of the biggest challenges in cancer by aggressively targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway, which drives millions of tumors globally. The core bull case rests on two pillars: First, the near-term success (2025) of their lead drug, Naporafenib, which is in a late-stage trial for a specific type of melanoma that currently lacks targeted treatment. If successful, this could provide a massive first-to-market revenue stream. Second, the long-term success (2026 and beyond) relies on their innovative next-generation drugs (like ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001) validating their comprehensive strategy—known as the 'MAPK Clamp'—to fully shut down the cancer signal and prevent drug resistance across major cancers like lung and colorectal, establishing Erasca as a dominant precision oncology company.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case depends entirely on successful outcomes in human clinical trials. Specifically: 1. The Phase 3 trial data for Naporafenib (expected late 2025) must show compelling efficacy and safety to gain regulatory approval. 2. The initial human data for the new, wholly-owned RAS-targeting drugs (ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001, expected in 2026) must be positive, proving their innovative multi-target strategy works. 3. The company must successfully partner or commercialize its drugs, maximizing the return on investment before their significant cash reserve runs out (projected end of 2028). 4. Larger, more established pharmaceutical companies do not launch a superior competing drug first.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and high-risk assumptions in the long thesis for Erasca, Inc. (ERAS).

### **Bear Case Thesis for Erasca, Inc. (ERAS)**

Erasca’s primary value is now concentrated in a high-risk, early-stage pipeline, having *de-prioritized* its most advanced asset for monetization. The Naporafenib catalyst, while near-term, has been commercially minimized by a strategy shift, placing the entire long-term success on the challenging, unproven "MAPK Clamp" approach with wholly-owned assets that have only Phase 1 monotherapy data expected in 2026. The company faces a looming value-trough as cash is spent on high-risk programs without a clear, near-term, wholly-owned revenue source.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **1. Flaws in the "Near-Term Success" (Naporafenib) Pillar**

*   **Contradiction in Revenue Strategy:** The long thesis assumes Naporafenib will provide a "massive first-to-market revenue stream," but Erasca has announced a **strategic decision to seek partnership opportunities** for the drug. This indicates the company is prioritizing a capital-efficient royalty/milestone stream over direct, high-cost commercialization, significantly reducing the potential "massive" revenue stream for Erasca itself.
*   **Soft Near-Term Catalyst Readout:** The expected 2025 Phase 3 data is a **Stage 1 readout** comparing Naporafenib plus a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) against the MEK inhibitor *alone* to select a dose. The *pivotal* Stage 2, which will compare the combination against the main regulatory comparator (physician's choice of chemotherapy or single-agent MEK inhibitor), is further out and represents the true, high-stakes catalyst.
*   **Historical Skepticism and Competition:** Naporafenib was originally developed and then divested by Novartis, a major pharmaceutical company, suggesting a previous lack of conviction in its potential as a wholly-owned asset. The market for melanoma is already competitive, dominated by large pharma with existing targeted therapies and immunotherapies.

#### **2. Flaws in the "Long-Term Success" (ERAS-0015 & ERAS-4001) Pillar**

*   **Extreme Development Risk:** The "MAPK Clamp" strategy relies on unproven, next-generation drugs (ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001) that are currently only in **Phase 1 monotherapy trials**. The failure rate for drugs transitioning from Phase 1 to regulatory approval is historically very high, especially in the notoriously difficult RAS/KRAS cancer space.
*   **Delayed "MAPK Clamp" Proof:** The core of the innovative strategy is the *combination* therapy (the "clamp"), but the data expected in 2026 is only for **monotherapy** (single-drug) Phase 1 trials. Proving the combination strategy works—and that it overcomes resistance and toxicity issues associated with multi-target inhibition—will require more time and is a much later-stage, binary catalyst beyond 2026.
*   **Aggressive Best-in-Class Assumption:** The long thesis rests on these drugs "validating their comprehensive strategy." The company positions ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001 as potential "best-in-class" or "first-in-class" pan-RAS/pan-KRAS inhibitors, but this is a purely aspirational label at the Phase 1 stage and is subject to intense, well-funded competition from larger, established oncology players.

#### **3. Flaws in Financial and Commercialization Assumptions**

*   **Cash Runway Bridge is Contingent on Pipeline Down-Shift:** The extended cash runway until the second half of 2028 is a positive, but it was achieved by **minimizing the commercial ambition for Naporafenib** (seeking partnership instead of sole commercialization) and by trimming other pipeline assets. This is a defensive financial move, not a growth-oriented commercial one, and highlights a high dependence on securing a lucrative partnership for their most advanced asset.
*   **Execution Risk in Commercialization/Partnership:** The assumption that the company can "successfully partner or commercialize its drugs, maximizing the return" is a significant risk. Securing a favorable partnership for Naporafenib, especially since the drug was acquired via in-licensing, will be challenging and its value will be heavily dictated by the 2025 Phase 3 Stage 1 data.
*   **Deep Accumulated Deficit:** As of early to mid-2025, the company's accumulated deficit was nearly \$800 million. While common for biotechs, this emphasizes that the company has a long way to go to become profitable and is entirely dependent on major clinical success.

## Next Steps

Based on your thorough analysis, the investigation is at a critical juncture. You have confirmed the strategic shift and the massive competitive risk. The next steps should focus on quantifying the value of the near-term clinical data and challenging the core assumptions of the long-term "MAPK Clamp" thesis against the established leader, Revolution Medicines.

Here are the most important unanswered questions and next steps for your investigation:

### **I. Near-Term Catalyst & Financial Risks (Naporafenib)**

1.  **Naporafenib Partnership Status and Deal Valuation:** Since the company decided in May 2025 to seek a partner, **has an agreement been announced yet?** If not, investigate the market's expected *valuation* of this licensing deal (e.g., typical upfront payments, milestones, and royalty rates for Phase 3 oncology assets) to quantify the potential non-dilutive capital and compare it to the company's total cash burn.
2.  **SEACRAFT-2 Stage 1 Data Readout Specifics:** The Stage 1 data is expected in H2 2025. Pinpoint the most likely **conference and date** (e.g., ESMO, SITC, etc.) where this data will be presented. The Phase 3 Stage 1 readout is the **single most immediate stock catalyst** and requires precise monitoring.
3.  **Quantifying the Cash Runway (Urgency):** You have a cash runway until H2 2028 and a net quarterly loss (burn) of approximately **\$33.9 million** (Q2 2025). Investigate how much *operational funding* is tied to the **assumption of a Naporafenib partnership**. If a partner is *not* found before the end of 2025, how quickly would the cash runway shorten, and what would be the subsequent risk of dilution?

---

### **II. Long-Term Moat & Competitive Validation (ERAS-0015 / ERAS-4001)**

4.  **Clinical Translation of Preclinical Superiority (The Core Moat Test):** Erasca claims that its lead asset, ERAS-0015, has **superior potency and requires lower doses** compared to the leading pan-RAS molecular glue (Revolution Medicines' RMC-6236) in preclinical models.
    *   **The Question:** In the context of the highly-toxic MAPK pathway, will this *preclinical dosing advantage* translate into a significantly *better therapeutic window* (i.e., less severe rash and GI toxicity) in its Phase 1 trials (expected 2026)? This is the **only way** Erasca's core "MAPK Clamp" combination strategy will succeed where others have failed.
5.  **Directly Comparing Combination Toxicity (The Ultimate Barrier):** The success of the "MAPK Clamp" hinges on **combination therapy**, which is prone to dose-limiting toxicity.
    *   **The Next Step:** Research any available **preclinical data** that specifically addresses the toxicity/tolerability of ERAS-0015/ERAS-4001 *in combination* with other MAPK-pathway drugs, and compare it directly to the known toxicity data for Revolution Medicines' combinations (e.g., RMC-6236 + RMC-6291), which the market is already expressing concerns about.
6.  **De-Risking the Lead Competitor's Lead (RVMD):** Revolution Medicines' RMC-6236 is already in a registrational Phase 3 trial.
    *   **The Question:** What are the most common and limiting **Grade 3/4 toxicities** associated with RMC-6236 monotherapy in the Phase 3 population? If a partner for Naporafenib is secured, use the resulting funding to assess if Erasca could accelerate combination trials *directly* in a tumor type or patient subset where RVMD's monotherapy data is weakest (e.g., low Objective Response Rate (ORR) in specific KRAS mutations).

### **III. Investor Sentiment and Valuation Disparity**

7.  **Unpacking the $1.00 Downgrade:** Investigate the specific rationale from the analyst (B of A Securities in Sep 2025) who downgraded the price target to **\$1.00**. This reflects a deep institutional skepticism (the low end of your bear case) that likely focuses on the inability to compete with Revolution Medicines and/or the commercial abandonment of Naporafenib.
8.  **Insider Trading and Option Vesting:** Look for any **insider purchases or sales** by the CEO, Dr. Jonathan Lim, or other key executives since the May 2025 pipeline shift. Given the heavy reliance on equity compensation, insider actions can be a critical signal of management's genuine conviction in the long-term, high-risk, wholly-owned pipeline.
