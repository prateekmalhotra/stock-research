### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

FTI Consulting's core business engine is driven by **Billable Headcount**, **Realized Bill Rates**, and **Utilization Rates** across its five segments: Corporate Finance & Restructuring (CF&R), Forensic & Litigation Consulting (FLC), Economic Consulting (EC), Technology (Tech), and Strategic Communications (StratCom).

#### Engine Assumptions and Justification:

The management commentary from the Q3 2025 earnings call highlights a key divergence:

*   **CF&R & FLC (Crisis/Risk/Dispute):** Strong double-digit growth is being driven by high demand for restructuring, transactions, risk, and investigations services, along with increased bill rates. This suggests resilience in "non-discretionary" high-stakes advisory services.
*   **EC & Tech (M&A-related/Cyclical):** Experiencing revenue declines due to soft M&A-related demand (antitrust services, second-request services) and talent transitions. Management is making "significant investments in senior talent" and technology (AI tools) in these segments for long-term growth.

**Conservative Revenue Growth Projections (2025-2030):**

The model assumes **$3.710 Billion** for 2025 Revenue (midpoint of management guidance). The growth for subsequent years is based on a conservative view of the business cycle, anticipating a gradual normalization of segment performance, and a slightly slower long-term growth rate than historical averages to be conservative.

| Year | Growth Rate | Justification | Projected Revenue ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | N/A | Management Guidance Midpoint | $3,710 |
| **2026** | 5.5% | Moderation from strong 2025 segment performance; a modest recovery in EC/Tech is expected as M&A/economic uncertainty subsides, partially offset by normalizing demand in CF&R/FLC. | $3,914 |
| **2027** | 5.0% | Continuation of mid-single-digit growth, reflecting a mature, cyclical consulting business. | $4,110 |
| **2028** | 4.5% | Long-term growth settles in the mid-single digits as the company gains marginal efficiencies from strategic talent and AI investments. | $4,295 |
| **2029** | 4.0% | Conservative growth rate nearing the terminal period. | $4,467 |
| **2030** | 3.5% | Continuation of the downward trend to a very conservative growth rate before maturity. | $4,623 |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projection

#### Margin Assumptions and Justification:

*   **Net Income Margin:** Q3 2025 Net Income was $82.8 million on $956.2 million in revenue, a Net Income Margin of 8.66%. Full-year Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.7% in Q3. I will use a long-term Net Income Margin projection to be conservative and consistent. The 5-year average Net Income Margin is approximately 6-8%. I will project a gradual improvement toward a conservative 9.0% by 2030, reflecting operational efficiency and leverage on a higher revenue base.
*   **Effective Tax Rate (ETR):** Management expects a full-year 2025 ETR between 22% and 24%. I will use the midpoint, **23.0%**, for the entire projection period.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Historical TTM ROIC is around 9.48%. A 5-year average is about 12.2%. Given the mandate for a **conservative** but reasonable positive ROIC, I will use a **9.0%** ROIC.

#### Net Income Calculation:

| Year | Revenue ($M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) ($M) | Prior Net Income/Cash ($M) | ROIC % | ROIC Income (B) ($M) | Total Net Income (A+B) ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3,710 | 7.50% | $278.3 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $278.3 |
| **2026** | $3,914 | 7.80% | $305.3 | $278.3 (2025) | 9.0% | $25.0 | $330.3 |
| **2027** | $4,110 | 8.10% | $332.9 | $330.3 (2026) | 9.0% | $29.7 | $362.6 |
| **2028** | $4,295 | 8.40% | $360.8 | $362.6 (2027) | 9.0% | $32.6 | $393.4 |
| **2029** | $4,467 | 8.70% | $388.6 | $393.4 (2028) | 9.0% | $35.4 | $424.0 |
| **2030** | $4,623 | 9.00% | $416.1 | $424.0 (2029) | 9.0% | $38.2 | $454.3 |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### Key Discounting Assumptions:

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable rate of **8.0%** is used. This is higher than a calculated WACC often cited (e.g., 4.74% in one search result), reflecting a conservative view on the risk profile of a professional services firm with cyclical segments.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%** is used, well below the long-term US GDP growth rate, as mandated for a conservative approach.

#### Discounted Cash Flow Calculation (Cash Flow = Net Income):

Net Income for each year is assumed to be the Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the purpose of this simple DCF model, following the rule that "net income for each year goes straight into cash."

| Year | Projected Net Income ($M) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $330.3 | 0.9259 | $305.8 |
| **2027** | $362.6 | 0.8573 | $310.8 |
| **2028** | $393.4 | 0.7938 | $312.2 |
| **2029** | $424.0 | 0.7350 | $311.6 |
| **2030** | $454.3 | 0.6806 | $309.2 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **$1,549.6** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation:

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the Present Value of all cash flows beyond 2030.
*   **Terminal Cash Flow (2030):** $454.3 million
*   **Formula:** TV = [CF (2030) * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
    *   TV = [$454.3 * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.08 - 0.02) = $463.39 / 0.06 = $7,723.17 million
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** TV * Discount Factor (2030)
    *   PV of TV = $7,723.17 million * 0.6806 = **$5,256.3 million**

#### Total Enterprise Value (TEV) Calculation:

| Metric | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2026-2030)** | $1,549.6 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $5,256.3 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$6,805.9** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $6,805.9 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | ($510.0) |
| **Add: Cash & Equivalents** | $146.0 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$6,441.9** |
| **Divided By: Shares Outstanding** | 30.876 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$208.66** |

### 6. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: $208.66**
**Current Stock Price: $170.07**

The calculated fair value of **$208.66** suggests that FTI Consulting stock is **undervalued** by the market relative to this DCF model.

#### Justification for the Difference:

The model's fair value is **22.7% higher** than the current market price of $170.07. This disparity is likely due to the market making more conservative assumptions about the company's immediate future performance and long-term stability than those derived from the management's guidance and the model's structure.

The key points of divergence and justification are:

1.  **Market Conservatism on Cyclical Segments:** The market is likely pricing in a more prolonged and severe downturn in the *Economic Consulting* and *Technology* segments than the model assumes. The commentary on reduced demand for M&A-related services and non-M&A antitrust services, and the uncertainty of improvement timing, creates a cloud of risk that the market discounts heavily. Our model, while conservative, assumes a normalization and modest recovery in these segments starting in 2026/2027 based on management's stated "strategic investments" and "long-term growth" focus.
2.  **ROIC/Reinvestment Assumption:** The market may not fully believe in the company's ability to maintain a 9.0% ROIC on all reinvested earnings (Net Income). This model strictly followed the rule that all net income is converted to cash and generates additional income at a conservative ROIC of **9.0%**. If the market assumes a lower ROIC, or if FTI continues its aggressive share repurchase program funded by debt (as seen in Q3 2025), it would consume cash and lower the calculated Enterprise Value.
3.  **Restructuring Cycle Peak:** The market may believe the current strength in the **Corporate Finance & Restructuring** segment is near its peak, driven by a transient, high-interest-rate, distressed environment. Once the restructuring cycle subsides, revenue growth could stall. Our model, conversely, spreads the growth assumption over five years, implicitly assuming that while one segment may slow (CF&R), the currently weak segments (EC, Tech) will pick up the slack due to management's talent investments, creating a more stable, diversified mid-single-digit growth platform.
