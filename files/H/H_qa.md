## Business Summary

Hyatt Hotels Corporation primarily operates as a major global brand that manages and franchises hotels owned by third-party real estate investors, which is known as an asset-light approach. This means Hyatt earns reliable, recurring fees by lending its brand name, management expertise, and global reservation system, rather than relying solely on owning physical buildings. Their diverse clientele spans both leisure travelers (tourists and families) and business travelers (corporate meetings and conventions) across North America and international markets. While they do own some hotels, their core strategy focuses on scaling their reliable fee income streams from these management and franchise agreements.

## Business Model Risk

The primary risk facing Hyatt is the extreme sensitivity of the travel industry to economic cycles and global events. In the near term, inflation and the rising cost of labor place pressure on hotel operating expenses, potentially reducing the profitability of their managed properties. Historically, severe economic downturns or recessions have caused dramatic drops in both leisure and corporate travel, directly reducing the occupancy levels and thus the fee revenue Hyatt collects; this cyclical nature remains a constant concern now due to current economic uncertainty. Long term, the emergence of alternative lodging platforms like Airbnb continues to challenge the traditional hotel model, and the threat of unforeseen global health crises or geopolitical instability, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, can instantly paralyze their global operations and severely halt earnings.

## Company History

This history lesson is structured to explain the journey of Hyatt Hotels Corporation in simple, easy-to-understand points.

---

### **A History of Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H)**

#### **I. Inception and Early Innovation (1957–1967)**

1.  **Founding Purpose:** Hyatt was founded in 1957 by lawyer Jay Pritzker when he purchased the original Hyatt House, a small motel located next to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). His goal was to capitalize on the **"burgeoning air travel industry,"** realizing that travelers needed a high-quality place to stay conveniently close to major airports.
2.  **The Pritzker Family:** Jay Pritzker and his younger brother, Donald Pritzker, quickly expanded the company, establishing it as a North American management and hotel ownership business. This marked the beginning of decades of close involvement by the Pritzker family.
3.  **A Defining Architectural Innovation:** In 1967, Hyatt opened the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, which revolutionized hotel design by featuring a dramatic, multi-story **atrium lobby**. This groundbreaking, spacious design became a signature feature, setting Hyatt apart and influencing hotel architecture globally.

#### **II. Growth, Challenges, and Crisis (1968–1980s)**

4.  **Global Expansion:** To focus on growth outside the United States, Hyatt International Corporation was formed in 1968, leading to the opening of the first international property in Hong Kong in 1969. This early international focus was a major tailwind for the company's global reach.
5.  **Focus on Customer Service:** In 1972, Hyatt demonstrated an early focus on customer accessibility by establishing a central reservations office with a dedicated toll-free 800 number.
6.  **Brand Diversification:** Recognizing different traveler needs, Hyatt introduced its first distinct high-end brands in 1980: **Park Hyatt** for luxury, residential-style stays, and **Grand Hyatt** for large, upscale properties in major gateway cities. This strategy helped them attract varied customers.
7.  **Major Crisis (Headwind):** A significant and tragic problem the company faced was the 1981 walkway collapse at the Hyatt Regency Kansas City, which resulted in the loss of life and a severe blow to the company's reputation and financial stability. Hyatt had to work hard to rebuild trust and focus on safety standards.

#### **III. Consolidation and Strategic Repositioning (1990s–2009)**

8.  **Re-Focus and Consolidation:** After being run as two separate private entities for decades (Hyatt Corporation and Hyatt International), the Pritzker family consolidated almost all of their hospitality assets in 2004 under one global entity: Hyatt Hotels Corporation.
9.  **Expansion into New Segments:** Hyatt continued to strategically expand its brand portfolio, introducing brands like **Hyatt Place** in 2006 for the fast-growing upper-midscale and extended-stay markets, and the stylish boutique brand **Andaz** in 2007.
10. **Return to Public Markets:** The company returned to being a publicly traded entity on the New York Stock Exchange in 2009 (under the ticker symbol 'H').

#### **IV. Modern Strategy and Transformation (2010–Present)**

11. **Addressing a Key Headwind:** In the mid-2010s, a major problem for Hyatt was its smaller size and footprint compared to massive competitors like Marriott and Hilton, which limited its reach.
12. **Innovative Solution: The "Asset-Light" Model:** To solve this, Hyatt made a major strategic shift toward an **"asset-light" model**. This means the company gradually sells off its physical hotel buildings (the "assets") and focuses instead on earning revenue through **management and franchising fees**. This reduces financial risk and allows for faster brand expansion worldwide with less capital (money).
13. **Building Customer Loyalty:** A major strategic solution was the launch of the reimagined **World of Hyatt** loyalty program in 2017. This program successfully increased customer engagement and loyalty, with members spending significantly more per year than non-members, driving high-quality, dependable revenue.
14. **Strategic Acquisitions (Tailwind/Solution):** Hyatt aggressively expanded its portfolio through strategic purchases to fill gaps and gain scale. Key examples include:
    *   Entering the all-inclusive resort market with the introduction of **Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara**.
    *   Acquiring **Apple Leisure Group** (a major travel and resort company) and **Dream Hotel Group** to solidify its position in the luxury and lifestyle segments, which were experiencing strong growth (a major tailwind).
    *   Acquiring **Mr & Mrs Smith** in 2023 to add over 1,500 luxury boutique and lifestyle properties to its network and enhance its loyalty program.
15. **The Modern Goal:** Today, Hyatt's official mission is **"We care for people so they can be their best,"** which guides its efforts to provide differentiated and personalized experiences for both its guests and employees globally. The company’s focus is on becoming the preferred brand in the high-end, luxury, and lifestyle segments, continuing its asset-light expansion, and leveraging its loyalty program to drive consistent growth.

## Moat Analysis

Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H) maintains a competitive moat primarily through its premium brand focus and the strength of its differentiated loyalty program, rather than sheer size or capital.

Here is an analysis of Hyatt's moat and what makes it different from its competitors, presented in simple terms.

### **The Core Moat: Brand Intangibility and Luxury Focus**

1.  **Special Position: Focus on Premium and Luxury:** Hyatt's main differentiator is its strategic focus on the high-end traveler. Approximately 70% of its rooms are classified as luxury or upper-upscale, which contrasts with its much larger competitors like Marriott and Hilton, who operate a more extensive portfolio that spans all market segments, including many budget and mid-scale options.
2.  **Special Pricing Power:** This premium positioning translates into a clear pricing advantage, allowing Hyatt to consistently achieve the highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) among the major global hotel chains. Some of its ultra-luxury brands, such as Park Hyatt, have historically maintained a 15-25% price premium over comparable local competitors.
3.  **Intangible Brand Asset:** The moat is built on the strong brand reputation associated with quality, personalized service, and a curated, modern portfolio of distinct lifestyle and luxury brands (e.g., Andaz, Alila, Thompson Hotels). This brand intangible asset is the primary source of its competitive advantage.

### **Customer Stickiness and Network Effects**

4.  **Sticky Loyalty Program (Network Effect):** The **World of Hyatt** loyalty program is widely regarded as one of the best in the industry, offering a high point value and generous, concrete benefits, like waived resort fees and guaranteed suite upgrades for top-tier members. This creates a strong network effect, incentivizing frequent travelers to consistently choose Hyatt's smaller network over competitors.
5.  **High-Value, Recurring Customer Base:** Hyatt’s loyalty members are extremely valuable; they stay an estimated 46% to 50% more often, spend 70% to 76% more money per year with Hyatt, and book directly roughly 90% of the time. This demonstrates a strong, sticky, and recurring customer relationship that provides a more profitable revenue stream to hotel owners.
6.  **Contractual Stickiness ("Asset-Light" Model):** Like its peers, Hyatt primarily uses an "asset-light" model, focusing on management and franchise contracts rather than owning most of the real estate. These long-term, fee-based contracts with property owners provide a stable, recurring revenue stream and reduce the company's financial exposure to volatile real estate markets.

### **Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk**

7.  **Reason for Growth: Strategic Acquisitions:** Hyatt grew into what it is today not just by building, but by strategically acquiring smaller, high-growth, and distinct luxury and lifestyle brands. Acquisitions like Apple Leisure Group (all-inclusive resorts), Two Roads Hospitality, and Mr & Mrs Smith (boutique/luxury platform) have doubled its luxury room count and quadrupled its lifestyle portfolio in a few years, immediately gaining new customer segments and global presence.
8.  **Resistance to Displacement by Capital:** While Marriott and Hilton are much larger in property count, a competitor with more capital would struggle to displace Hyatt because its moat is not simply scale. Hyatt's key advantage is the *quality* of its curated brands and the *stickiness* of its high-value customer base. Displacing an entrenched, decades-old luxury brand reputation and a top-rated loyalty program is a slow, difficult, and expensive process, even with a massive capital injection.
9.  **Investment in Innovation and R&D:** The hospitality industry requires constant innovation in service and experience, rather than traditional manufacturing R&D. Hyatt invests in maintaining its edge through:
    *   **Loyalty Program Enhancements:** Continuously updating the World of Hyatt program to be the most rewarding for top-tier members.
    *   **Strategic Expansion:** Innovating its brand offerings to capture growing trends like all-inclusive luxury and unique lifestyle experiences through targeted acquisitions.

The core strategy, as articulated by management, centers on a shift to an **asset-light business model** and **expansion of its high-margin fee-based business**.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Strong Global RevPAR Growth:**

    *   **Management's View:** CEO Mark S. Hoplamazian stated that significant progress on asset dispositions is "further expanding our asset-light earnings mix," which is expected to **exceed 80% on a run-rate basis** once the commitment is met, leading to a higher-quality earnings stream.

3.  **Increased Shareholder Returns:**
    *   **Catalyst:** Hyatt's board authorized a $1 billion increase to its share repurchase program, making approximately $1.8 billion available for share buybacks.
    *   **Management's View:** For 2024, the company projected capital returns to shareholders to be between $800 million and $850 million, inclusive of dividends and repurchases, which is a direct mechanism to boost Earnings Per Share (EPS).

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Record-Breaking Development Pipeline:**
    *   **Catalyst:** The hotel development pipeline reached a new record of approximately 129,000 rooms as of the first quarter of 2024, which translates directly into future fee revenue.

2.  **Expansion of High-Growth Luxury and Lifestyle Segments:**
    *   **Catalyst:** Hyatt is strategically expanding its portfolio with high-fee brands like Park Hyatt, Andaz, Alila, and Thompson Hotels, opening properties in high-value global cities.
    *   **Management's View:** This expansion enhances their network by offering new lifestyle resorts and upper mid-scale hotels across new markets and price points, which diversifies and solidifies their future fee revenue base.

3.  **Loyalty Program Growth:**
    *   **Catalyst:** The "World of Hyatt" loyalty program has seen rapid growth, reaching a new high of approximately 46 million members, with loyalty room night penetration increasing in the first quarter of 2024.
    *   **Management's View:** The expanding membership base is highlighted as "highly valuable" because it drives direct bookings and repeat business, reducing reliance on more costly third-party booking channels and boosting profitability.

His background includes a long tenure at the Pritzker Organization, the principal financial advisor to the founding family's business interests.
2.  **Strategic Asset-Light Transformation:** The core of the current management's strategy, initiated around 2017, is a successful shift from a real estate-heavy model to an asset-light, fee-based management and franchising business. The management team aims to achieve 90% of its earnings mix from franchise and management fees by 2027, fulfilling a long-term promise to shareholders.
3.  **Delivering on Growth:** The company has a track record of consistent organic expansion, delivering industry-leading net rooms growth for eight consecutive years through the end of 2024.
4.  **Shareholder Value Focus:** Management has shown a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, evidenced by the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend and the authorization of a significant share buyback program.
5.  **Key Acquisitions as Growth Drivers:** Management's track record is defined by strategic, high-value acquisitions to quickly scale the business, particularly in high-growth segments. Notable deals include the acquisitions of Two Roads Hospitality (2018), Apple Leisure Group (ALG) (2021), and the recent acquisition and subsequent 'flipping' of Playa Hotels & Resorts to accelerate the asset-light strategy.
6.  **Pritzker Family Oversight:** Thomas J. Pritzker, whose family founded the company, remains the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, maintaining a strong link to the company's historical ownership and strategic direction.

### **Future Strategy and Vision**

1.  **Focus on Luxury, Lifestyle, and All-Inclusive:** The primary vision for future growth is centered on expanding its portfolio of high-end brands across the luxury, lifestyle, and all-inclusive segments, which are seen as having a significant "white space for growth".
2.  **Brand Realignment:** Hyatt is strategically organizing its extensive brand collection into five distinct portfolios—Lifestyle, Luxury, Inclusive, Classics, and Essentials—to enhance owner returns, clarify brand differentiation, and accelerate growth.
3.  **Experiential Hospitality:** The forward-looking strategy emphasizes elevating the guest experience through wellness, experiential travel, and immersive stays, which is particularly relevant to appealing to modern luxury travelers.
4.  **Operational Agility:** Recent senior leadership changes, including appointing a new Chief Growth Officer, are intended to create a more agile, brand-focused, and high-performance enterprise to execute on the accelerated growth ambitions.

1.  **Pritzker Family History:** Hyatt was founded by Jay Pritzker in 1957; the Pritzker family has maintained control over the company through various stages of its history, including taking the company private and later consolidating all hospitality assets under the present corporate structure in 2004.
2.  **Transition to Current CEO:** The direct transition to the current management structure saw Thomas J. Pritzker serve as CEO from August 2004 until December 2006, when Mark Hoplamazian was appointed to the role. This continuity suggests a planned evolution of leadership within the Pritzker family's long-standing sphere of influence.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of Hyatt Hotels Corporation's (H) 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) and related filings, the management incentive and compensation structure demonstrates a strong alignment with long-term shareholder interests.

### **Insider Ownership and Control (Higher the Better)**

1.  **Dominant Voting Control:** Hyatt maintains a dual-class stock structure, giving the Pritzker family—the founding and controlling family—a disproportionately high level of control. Filings from early 2024 indicate the Pritzker Family Group beneficially owns a substantial majority of the company's total voting power, cited at approximately 88.9% of the total voting power of the common stock outstanding.
2.  **High Insider Ownership:** The family's significant ownership stake (beneficially owning over 50% of the total Common Stock outstanding in 2024) is the ultimate alignment mechanism, meaning their wealth is directly tied to the company's long-term stock performance.
3.  **Key Leadership Ties:** Both the Executive Chairman (Thomas J. Pritzker) and the President and CEO (Mark S. Hoplamazian) have deep, long-standing ties to the Pritzker family business interests, reinforcing the commitment of the controlling shareholder to the company's performance.

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

4.  **Emphasis on Variable and Performance-Based Pay:** The executive compensation program is specifically designed to emphasize "pay for performance" by prioritizing variable compensation over fixed base salary.
5.  **Long-Term Equity Focus (LTI):** A substantial portion of compensation is delivered through long-term equity, including Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), and Performance Stock Units (PSUs), explicitly structured to encourage a focus on earnings, returns, and long-term stockholder value.
6.  **Performance Stock Units (PSUs):** PSUs are only earned based on performance against specified long-term goals and generally have a performance period of at least three years, directly incentivizing executives to achieve sustained financial success for shareholders.
7.  **Stock Ownership Requirements:** The company mandates that executive officers and non-employee directors maintain specific, market-competitive stock ownership levels, which further compels managers to act as owners.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

8.  **Incentive Alignment:** Management, particularly the CEO, is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of all shareholders because the controlling shareholder is an insider (the Pritzker family) with a massive, multi-decade stake in the company.
9.  **Protection Against Short-Term Gain:** The use of multi-year vesting PSUs and a policy prohibiting the hedging of company stock discourages executives from making short-term, risky decisions purely for personal profit that could harm long-term stock value.
10. **Overall Assessment:** The combination of extremely high insider/family voting power and a compensation structure dominated by long-term, performance-based equity demonstrates that management has substantial and structural incentives to prioritize the creation of long-term economic value for all shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a review of its recent price history and technical indicators (as of a late September 2025 reference point), here is an analysis of Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H):

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is currently trading significantly above its 52-week low but well below its high. The 52-week range for Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H) is approximately **$102.42 to $168.20**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Using a recent closing price of approximately $142.76 (from late September 2025 data) and the 52-week low of $102.42, the stock is trading roughly **39.36%** above its 52-week low.

3.  **Is it Trading Low? (Technical Analysis):** The stock is **not technically trading low** in an "oversold" sense. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around **50.18**, which is a **Neutral** signal and indicates the stock is in a mid-range and neither oversold nor overbought.

4.  **Moving Averages Signal:** Technical indicators present a mixed-to-positive picture. The stock price is currently trading *above* its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day exponential and simple moving averages, which generally acts as a **Buy** signal for intermediate to long-term trends. However, some short-term averages (like the 20-day EMA) may show a Sell signal, and some analyses hold a negative evaluation, suggesting a lack of strong momentum.

5.  **Big Gain Explanation (Recent Months):** The stock experienced a robust performance, at one point gaining **10% over the last month** (relative to the snippet date). This move, particularly a sharp jump, was partly fueled by positive market sentiment following comments from the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which hinted at the potential for interest rate cuts, benefiting the travel and leisure sector.

6.  **Downward Pressure/Softer Performance:** Despite recent gains, the stock had declined over 10% for the year (as of the snippet date) due to signs of **softening demand in the United States** and the company's subsequent decision to **downgrade its full-year outlook**.

7.  **Strategic Move:** A notable event was Hyatt's agreement to **sell the real estate portfolio** owned by Playa Hotels for $2 billion, a move designed to further strengthen the company's **asset-light strategy** by focusing more on management and franchising.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Hyatt rests on its strategic transformation into a reliable, high-margin fee business, moving away from volatile real estate ownership. In the near term, the company is rapidly completing its 'asset-light' goal by selling off hotel buildings, which stabilizes its finances and enables significant share buybacks to boost stock value. Long term, Hyatt is positioned for superior growth because it focuses almost entirely on the resilient, high-spending luxury and lifestyle travel segments. Its record-high development pipeline is concentrated in these profitable areas, and its powerful World of Hyatt loyalty program ensures a recurring base of high-value customers. By continuously adding high-end brands through strategic acquisitions and collecting predictable management and franchise fees, Hyatt can deliver faster, less cyclical earnings growth than its peers.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic outlook assumes that the global economy avoids a severe recession, allowing strong demand for both business and leisure travel, especially in the premium and luxury segments, to continue. We must assume Hyatt successfully executes the planned $2.0 billion in asset sales to solidify the asset-light model, and that management effectively uses this cash flow for debt reduction and robust shareholder returns. Furthermore, the World of Hyatt loyalty program must maintain its industry-leading value to ensure customer stickiness, and new hotel openings must be maintained at or above the current record pace to translate the pipeline into actual recurring fee revenue.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws, risks, and inherent structural limitations in the bull case for Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H).

## Bear Case Thesis & Critique of Bull Case

1.  **Excessive Reliance on a Single Segment in an Economic Slowdown:** The thesis is vulnerable to the major assumption that the global economy avoids a severe recession. While the luxury segment has been resilient, a significant, prolonged economic downturn would cause even high-net-worth consumers to curtail discretionary travel, leading to an outsized negative impact on Hyatt, which concentrates nearly 70% of its portfolio in the luxury and upper-upscale segments.

2.  **Intensifying Competition in Core Growth Area (Luxury/Lifestyle):** The assertion of "superior growth" is challenged by the fact that the lifestyle segment, Hyatt's key focus, is becoming increasingly saturated, with all major competitors aggressively pursuing brand acquisitions and expansion to engage in the "lifestyle wars." This intense competition could compress margins or slow the pace of new franchise signings for Hyatt.

3.  **Structural Flaw: Limited Global Footprint Dilutes Loyalty Program Value:** Despite the World of Hyatt program's high quality and superior point value, its structural weakness is a significantly smaller global footprint compared to larger rivals like Marriott and Hilton. This scarcity makes it harder for members to earn top-tier status and limits redemption options, which fundamentally restricts the loyalty program's "network effect" and "customer stickiness" in many global markets.

4.  **Execution Risk on the 'Asset-Light' Transition:** While the $2.0 billion asset sale of the Playa real estate is a strategic positive and a major step toward the asset-light goal, the capital is not fully realized yet, and the sale is expected to close by year-end 2025. Furthermore, the cash will primarily be used to repay debt from the Playa acquisition, limiting the *immediate* capital available for "significant share buybacks" to aggressively boost stock value as the bull case suggests.

5.  **Introduction of Lower-Margin Segments and Brand Dilution Risk:** To combat the limited footprint, Hyatt is expanding beyond its luxury focus with new brands like the upper-midscale extended-stay brand, Hyatt Studios. This strategic deviation from "almost entirely on the resilient, high-spending luxury and lifestyle travel segments" introduces exposure to lower RevPAR, lower-margin segments, and a potential risk of diluting the premium brand image of the overall portfolio.

6.  **Pipeline Conversion Risks in a Higher-Cost Environment:** The record-high development pipeline is subject to macro-risks not fully accounted for in the optimistic view of "rapidly completing." Persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and global supply chain constraints may lead to construction delays and increasing development costs, which can slow the conversion of the signed pipeline into fee-generating revenue, thereby postponing the expected earnings acceleration.

## Next Steps

The analysis you have completed is comprehensive, covering the business model, history, competitive moat, management, and both bull and bear cases. The search results from the initial query provide recent financial context, especially regarding the asset-light transition.

The next steps should pivot from qualitative analysis (the story) to **quantitative analysis** (the numbers) to answer the ultimate question: is the stock correctly valued for the growth it promises?

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should take:

### **Next Steps and Unanswered Questions**

#### **I. Valuation and Comparables (The most critical missing piece)**

1.  **Investigate Valuation Metrics:** Determine the company's current valuation, specifically the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and the Enterprise Value to Adjusted EBITDA (EV/Adjusted EBITDA) ratio.
2.  **Compare to Peers:** Directly compare Hyatt's valuation metrics (P/E and EV/EBITDA) against its primary asset-light competitors, **Marriott International (MAR)** and **Hilton Worldwide (HLT)**. *The search results already suggest MAR and HLT have significantly higher revenue and market share, making this comparison crucial.*
3.  **Assess Market Discount/Premium:** Based on the comparison, is Hyatt trading at a premium (justified by its superior luxury mix and RevPAR), or a discount (justified by its smaller scale and higher debt), and how significant is that gap?

#### **II. Financial Health and Capital Allocation**

4.  **Confirm True Debt Position:** Calculate the projected Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio after the anticipated $2.0 billion Playa real estate sale closes (expected by end of 2025). *The sale is mandatory for debt repayment, but the exact post-sale debt burden is key to judging financial flexibility.*
5.  **Evaluate Free Cash Flow Quality:** Examine the trend in the margin generated from **management and franchise fees** versus the margin from **owned and leased properties**. This will determine if the asset-light transition is delivering on its promise of a truly higher-quality, less volatile, and higher-margin earnings mix.
6.  **Verify Share Buyback Effectiveness:** Investigate the recent history of the total number of shares outstanding and the average repurchase price of shares. This checks whether management is executing the share buyback program (a key catalyst) efficiently to boost shareholder value.

#### **III. Deep Dive into Competitive Moat Threats**

7.  **Analyze Competitor's Luxury Push:** Search for recent strategic brand launches or acquisitions by Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) focused *specifically* on the high-end, luxury, and all-inclusive segments (e.g., Hilton's Waldorf Astoria, Marriott's Edition/Ritz-Carlton). This will validate or refute the bear case's concern about "Intensifying Competition."
8.  **Quantify Brand Dilution Risk:** Investigate the size and expected room count for the new upper-midscale brand, **Hyatt Studios**, within the current development pipeline. A large pipeline for this lower-margin brand would confirm a major risk of "Brand Dilution."
