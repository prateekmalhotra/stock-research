| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $233 | Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets, Dec 31, 2025 |

| **Current Stock Price** | ~$1.54 | Approximate value for comparison |

### B. Business Engine and Conservative Assumptions

Conduent is a global business process solutions company currently undergoing a turnaround, aiming for "consistent year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth". The new CEO is focused on executing six priorities, including portfolio rationalization ("fix, sell, or grow") and cost reduction through "maximum financial discipline".

The revenue and margin model is based on a conservative interpretation of management's commentary:

| Segment | FY 2025 Performance | Management Commentary / Engine Driver | Conservative Assumption (CAGR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Government** | Revenue down 6.3% (but Q4 up 1.8%). New ACV up 50%. | **Strong momentum, positioned for 2026 growth**. | **3.0%** |
| **Transportation** | Revenue up 3.9%. New ACV up 14%. | **Positive momentum, positioned for 2026 growth**. | **3.5%** |
| **Commercial** | Revenue down 5.9%. New ACV down 15%. **15-20%** of business exposed to AI risk. | Volume declines at largest clients. Strategy is to strengthen go-to-market. | **-3.0%** (Slow decay and then stabilization) |

**Revenue Projection Methodology:**

1.  **FY 2025 Revenue Breakdown (Approximate from snippets):**
    *   Commercial: $1,500M
    *   Government: $922M
    *   Transportation: $609M
    *   *Total Adjusted Revenue:* $3,031M (Matches $3,042M close enough for modeling).
2.  **Consolidated Revenue Growth Rate:** A weighted average of the segment growth rates will yield the consolidated rate for 2026. After 2026, the overall growth will converge toward a mature market rate as the portfolio is rationalized, and segment growth rates become more normalized.

**Margin Projection Methodology:**

1.  **Baseline Net Income Margin (2025):** $(170)M / $3,042M = **-5.6%**.
2.  **Target Margin:** Management targets 8-10% Adjusted EBITDA margin in the medium term. I will assume the low end, **8.0%**, is achieved by 2030, a significant but achievable improvement given the focus on cost efficiency (including AI use) and portfolio rationalization.
3.  **Net Income Margin:** A conservative long-term Net Income Margin is estimated to be **3.0%** by 2030. This accounts for D&A, interest expense (which should decline as debt is paid down, a positive), and a minimal tax rate on the new profits, a substantial recovery from the 2025 loss.

## 2. Financial Projections and Cash Flow Calculation

### A. Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

| Year | Government (3.0% CAGR) | Transportation (3.5% CAGR) | Commercial (-3.0% CAGR) | **Total Revenue** | **Growth Rate** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $922 | $609 | $1,500 | **$3,031** | -4.2% (Historical) |
| **2026** | $949 | $630 | $1,455 | **$3,034** | 0.1% |
| **2027** | $977 | $652 | $1,411 | **$3,040** | 0.2% |
| **2028** | $1,006 | $675 | $1,368 | **$3,049** | 0.3% |
| **2029** | $1,036 | $699 | $1,327 | **$3,062** | 0.4% |
| **2030** | $1,067 | $723 | $1,287 | **$3,077** | 0.5% |

*Rationale:* The overall revenue remains largely flat in the projection period, reflecting the conservative assumption that the growth in the Government and Transportation segments will only marginally outpace the revenue runoff and decline in the Commercial segment, which is exposed to AI/tech disruption.

### B. Net Income Projections and Cash Flow

| Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | **Net Income** | Prior Year Net Income (Cash) | Conservative ROIC (4.0%) | **Cash Flow (NI + ROIC)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3,031 | -5.60% | $(170) | N/A | N/A | $(170) |
| **2026** | $3,034 | -3.00% | $(91) | $(170) | N/A | $(91) |
| **2027** | $3,040 | -0.50% | $(15) | $(91) | N/A | $(15) |
| **2028** | $3,049 | 1.00% | $30 | $(15) | N/A | $30 |
| **2029** | $3,062 | 2.00% | $61 | $30 | 4.0% of $30 = $1.2 | $62 |
| **2030** | $3,077 | 3.00% | $92 | $61 | 4.0% of $61 = $2.4 | $94 |

*   **ROIC Rationale:** The ROIC principle (reinvested cash generating additional income) is only applied once Net Income becomes positive. A conservative **4.0% ROIC** is used, reflecting a low-return business in a turnaround phase.
*   **Net Income Margin Rationale:** The margin is projected to linearly improve from the **-5.6%** loss in 2025 toward the long-term target of **3.0%** by 2030, reflecting management's execution on cost efficiency and portfolio optimization.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### A. DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **10.0%** | A high discount rate is conservative and appropriate for a turnaround company with a net debt position, negative historical GAAP net income, and high technology disruption risk. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **0.5%** | A very conservative rate, well below long-term inflation/GDP, reflecting a mature BPO company with ongoing structural headwinds. |

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Projected Cash Flow (NI + ROIC) | Discount Factor (1 / (1+r)^t) | **Net Present Value (NPV)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2026 (1) | $(91) | 0.9091 | $(83) |
| 2027 (2) | $(15) | 0.8264 | $(12) |
| 2028 (3) | $30 | 0.7513 | $23 |
| 2029 (4) | $62 | 0.6830 | $42 |
| 2030 (5) | $94 | 0.6209 | $58 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026-2030)** | | | **$28** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value (TV) captures the value of all cash flows beyond 2030. The formula is:

$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{Cash Flow_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{(r - g)}
$$

$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{\$94 \times (1 + 0.005)}{(0.10 - 0.005)} = \frac{\$94.47}{0.095} = \$994.42 \text{ million}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

$$
NPV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$994.42 \times 0.6209 = \mathbf{\$617.65} \text{ million}
$$

### D. Total Equity Value

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030) | $28 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $618 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$646** |
| Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents | $233 |
| Less: Total Debt | $(687) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$192** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value per Share Calculation

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$192 \text{ million}}{157.97 \text{ million shares}}
$$

$$
\mathbf{\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$1.22}
$$

### Current Stock Price and Valuation Discrepancy

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$1.22** |
| **Current Market Price** | **~$1.54** |
| **Difference** | **-20.78%** |

### Justification for Difference

The calculated Fair Value of **$1.22** is below the current market price of **~$1.54**. This suggests the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's turnaround than the conservative model.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. Conservative Model:**

1.  **More Aggressive Revenue Growth:** The market may be placing higher confidence in the new business signings (ACV up 6%) and the pivot to growth in Government/Transportation segments. For the current price to be justified, the market likely projects consolidated revenue growth to stabilize and accelerate to a permanent $4.5\%$ to $5.0\%$ long-term growth rate, or for the Commercial segment decline to stop much sooner than modeled.
2.  **Faster, Deeper Margin Expansion:** The market is likely pricing in a faster and more successful execution of the CEO's cost-efficiency and portfolio optimization plan. Instead of reaching a 3.0% Net Income margin by 2030, the market may believe the company will achieve the high end of the Adjusted EBITDA target (**10%**) by 2028-2029, with a corresponding Net Income Margin of $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ to $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ earlier than modeled. This is a "turnaround premium" based on the new management's execution pledge.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may view Conduent as a lower-risk investment than the **10.0%** discount rate used here, possibly assuming the debt can be successfully reduced from asset sales (portfolio rationalization) as planned, thereby lowering the systematic risk and cost of capital.

**Conclusion:**

The conservative DCF valuation suggests that Conduent Incorporated (CNDT) is currently **overvalued** by the market at $\sim\$1.54 per share. The difference reflects the high degree of execution risk inherent in a complex turnaround story with a significant debt load and structural industry headwinds (AI disruption). The market is willing to bet on the successful execution of the strategic plan, while the conservative valuation holds a lower expectation until positive GAAP Net Income and Free Cash Flow are demonstrated.
