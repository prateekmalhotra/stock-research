## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core of Conduent's business engine is a multi-year turnaround strategy focused on portfolio rationalization, debt reduction, and a shift to a "nimble, technology-led" model. The key drivers are:
1.  **Divestiture of Non-Core Assets:** The company completed its 2024 divestiture program (e.g., BenefitWallet, Casualty Claims) to clean up the balance sheet and focus on "RemainCo" assets, generating significant cash for debt paydown.
2.  **Revenue Trough & Turnaround:** Management has explicitly stated that 2024 represents the **trough** for growth, with a transition to being closer to flat by the end of 2024, and expecting growth in the second half of 2025.
3.  **Sales Momentum:** The new business Annual Contract Value (ACV) is a primary forward indicator. The full-year 2024 ACV estimate is **$500M - $550M**, which will begin to outpace the runoff from lost business and divestitures.
4.  **Margin Expansion:** The strategy involves aggressive cost-cutting to remove stranded costs from divestitures and operational efficiencies, with an explicit 2025 Adjusted EBITDA Margin target of 5.0% - 5.5%.

### Revenue Projection Justification

We start with the midpoint of the full-year 2024 Adjusted Revenue guidance of **$3.35 Billion** (a midpoint of \$3.325B to \$3.375B) as the foundation for our 2025 projection.

| Year | Revenue Rationale & Assumptions | Projected Revenue ($M) | YoY Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (E)** | Midpoint of Adjusted Revenue Guidance | $3,350 | - |
| **2025** | The expected "trough" year, with growth only starting in H2 2025 (i.e., minimal net growth). We assume **0.0%** growth for the full year. | $3,350 | 0.0% |
| **2026** | Modest growth begins as new ACV outpaces runoff and operational focus improves. A conservative **1.5%** growth. | $3,400 | 1.5% |
| **2027** | Steady state modest growth, slightly accelerating as the "nimble" model matures. Conservative **2.0%** growth. | $3,468 | 2.0% |
| **2028** | Continued modest growth rate. Conservative **2.0%** growth. | $3,537 | 2.0% |
| **2029** | Continued modest growth rate. Conservative **2.0%** growth. | $3,608 | 2.0% |
| **2030** | Continued modest growth rate, leading into the terminal value. Conservative **2.0%** growth. | $3,680 | 2.0% |

## 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

The valuation will use a Net Income-based Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), with the net income acting as the annual free cash flow (as per the user's rule).

### Net Income Margin Justification

| Metric | 2024E | 2025E | 2026-2030 | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adj. EBITDA Margin (%)** | 4.5% | 5.25% | 6.0% | Midpoint of 2024 Guidance; Midpoint of 2025 Target; Continued operational/cost efficiency gains (conservative expansion). |
| **Estimated D&A & Impairment (% Rev)** | -4.0% | -3.5% | -3.0% | Historical D&A (approx 3%-4% of Rev). Reduced as assets are divested and CapEx is focused. |
| **EBIT Margin (%)** | 0.5% | 1.75% | 3.0% | *Adj. EBITDA Margin + D&A* |
| **Estimated Interest Expense (% Rev)** | -0.9% | -0.6% | -0.5% | Significant debt prepayments in 2024 will sharply reduce interest burden. |
| **EBT Margin (%)** | -0.4% | 1.15% | 2.5% | *EBIT Margin + Interest* |
| **Estimated Tax Rate** | 0.0% | 0.0% | 20.0% | Company will likely carry forward net operating losses (NOLs) for a few years, resulting in a **0%** cash tax rate until 2027, then a conservative **20%** statutory rate. |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | -0.4% | **1.15%** | **2.0%** | *EBT Margin * (1 - Tax Rate)* (Conservative target for a mature BPO business). |

### Net Income & Cash Flow Schedule (in millions)

| Year | Projected Revenue ($M) | Net Income Margin (%) | Base Net Income ($M) | ROIC (%) | Previous Cash ($M) | ROIC Income ($M) | Total Net Income ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,350 | -0.4% | $(13.4)$ | N/A | N/A | N/A | $(13.4)$ |
| **2025** | $3,350 | 1.15% | $38.5 | 3.0% | $393.0 | $11.8 | $50.3 |
| **2026** | $3,400 | 1.50% | $51.0 | 3.0% | $443.3 | $13.3 | $64.3 |
| **2027** | $3,468 | 1.80% | $62.4 | 3.0% | $507.6 | $15.2 | $77.6 |
| **2028** | $3,537 | 2.00% | $70.7 | 3.0% | $585.2 | $17.6 | $88.3 |
| **2029** | $3,608 | 2.00% | $72.2 | 3.0% | $673.5 | $20.2 | $92.4 |
| **2030** | $3,680 | 2.00% | $73.6 | 3.0% | $765.9 | $23.0 | $96.6 |

**ROIC Justification:**
*   The historical ROIC is negative (-3.37%) due to past losses.
*   As per the rule, we use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC. A $1 billion market cap business in a highly competitive, low-growth sector like BPO/IT Services is unlikely to generate high returns. We use a conservative **3.0% ROIC** on the cumulative cash balance, significantly lower than the cost of capital, reflecting a mature and slow-growth business.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### Discount Rate Selection

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** 10.0%
    *   *Justification:* Conduent is a small-cap, highly volatile (Beta > 1.3), and turnaround stock in a low-margin industry. A high discount rate is necessary to reflect the significant business execution risk involved in their divestiture and growth strategy.

### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030. We assume the company reaches maturity and grows at a very conservative rate.

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** 1.0%
    *   *Justification:* Reflects a mature, slow-growing BPO company, slightly above zero (which is conservative for a long-term inflation/GDP proxy).
*   **Terminal Year Free Cash Flow (2030 Net Income):** $96.6M
*   **Terminal Value (TV) Formula:** FCF(2030) * (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)
    *   $96.6M * (1 + 0.01) / (0.10 - 0.01)$
    *   $97.57M / 0.09 = **$1,084.1M**

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Future Cash Flow (Net Income) ($M) | Discount Rate (10.0%) | Present Value (PV) ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $50.3 | 0.909 | $45.7 |
| **2026** | $64.3 | 0.826 | $53.1 |
| **2027** | $77.6 | 0.751 | $58.3 |
| **2028** | $88.3 | 0.683 | $60.3 |
| **2029** | $92.4 | 0.621 | $57.4 |
| **2030** | $96.6 | 0.564 | $54.5 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | $1,084.1 | 0.564 | $611.8 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows** | **$941.1M** | | |

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value is calculated using the Equity Value approach:

$$
\text{Equity Value} = \text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Current Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

| Metric | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $941.1$ |
| **ADD: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $393.0$ |
| **LESS: Total Principal Debt Outstanding** | $(753.0)$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$581.1** |
| **Shares Outstanding** (Millions) | 157.97 |

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \text{Total Equity Value} / \text{Shares Outstanding}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$581.1 \text{M} / 157.97 \text{M} = **\$3.68**
$$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$3.68** |
| **Current Market Value per Share** (Approx. Nov 2, 2025) | **$2.40** |
| **Valuation Gap** | **53.3% Higher** |

### Justification for the Valuation Gap

Our calculated Fair Value of **\$3.68** is **53.3% higher** than the current market price of **\$2.40**. This significant discrepancy suggests the market and our model are making fundamentally different assumptions about the company's future:

**Market's Assumptions (The Skeptical View):**

1.  **Failure to Execute Turnaround:** The market is likely pricing in a high probability that Conduent will **fail to achieve its margin expansion targets** and that **2024 is not the revenue trough**. The market sees the $3.35B revenue base as fragile, with the new ACV not being sufficient to completely offset the ongoing runoff of old, higher-margin contracts.
2.  **High Risk, Low Return:** The market is implicitly using a much higher discount rate (perhaps 15-20%) and/or a much lower terminal growth rate (0% or even negative) due to the company's long history of losses and its exposure to competitive, low-growth business process outsourcing (BPO) services. The negative historical ROIC also weighs heavily on market perception.
3.  **Net Income is Not True Free Cash Flow:** Our model assumes Net Income converts directly to FCF. The market may be discounting for CapEx (which management guided to 3.1% of revenue in 2023) and working capital volatility, making the true FCF much lower than the projected Net Income.

**Model's Assumptions (The Management-Guided Conservative View):**

1.  **Successful Execution of Management Plan:** Our model relies on management's explicit guidance that 2024 is the **trough** and the margin will improve to a **5.25% EBITDA margin by 2025**. The model credits the company for the successful divestiture program and debt paydown, assuming the business becomes more focused and efficient.
2.  **Conversion to Sustainable Profitability:** Our projection of a conservative but achievable **2.0% Net Income Margin** by the end of the projection period is the key value driver. This is a very modest margin for a business that handles high-volume government and commercial transactions, suggesting significant room for upside if the transition to technology-led services is successful.
3.  **Conservative Valuation Metrics:** The model already uses highly conservative DCF inputs: a high **10.0% Discount Rate** and a minimal **1.0% Terminal Growth Rate**. The 3.0% ROIC is also very conservative. The positive valuation is driven by the fact that even with these conservative inputs, the projected profitability from the successful execution of the turnaround yields a higher intrinsic value.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value of **\$3.68** represents a scenario where Conduent successfully navigates its multi-year turnaround as outlined by management. The market's price of **\$2.40** reflects deep skepticism about the company's ability to transition from a long-time loss-maker to a reliably profitable and growing entity. **The stock is a value proposition that is dependent on the flawless execution of their strategic plan to cut stranded costs and grow the remaining 'RemainCo' businesses.** If management hits the 5.25% EBITDA target for 2025 and begins to grow revenue in the back half of the year, the market is likely to re-rate the stock towards our calculated Fair Value.
