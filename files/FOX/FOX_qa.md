## Business Summary

Fox Corporation operates mainly as a television broadcaster and cable network provider focused heavily on news and live sports content within the United States. The company operates a dual revenue stream. The largest and most stable revenue stream comes from “Affiliate Fees,” where distributors like cable companies and streaming services (Hulu Live, YouTube TV) pay Fox a fee every month for every subscriber who can access channels such as Fox News and FS1. The second major revenue source is advertising, where Fox sells commercial time to businesses during its programming, especially during high-demand live events like NFL games. The company's primary customers are large media distributors (B2B) who carry their networks, and millions of U.S. households who watch their content.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant long-term risk facing Fox is the accelerating trend of 'cord-cutting,' where consumers abandon expensive cable subscriptions in favor of cheaper, alternative streaming services. Since Fox relies heavily on the stable affiliate fees paid by these cable providers, the shrinking pool of cable subscribers directly harms Fox's core revenue base; although they have mitigated this by hiking prices, this strategy cannot last forever. A major near-term financial risk involves the extremely high and escalating cost of securing major sports broadcast rights (such as the NFL). If Fox loses a core sports contract to a competitor, potentially a deep-pocketed tech company like Amazon, the company would struggle to attract high-paying advertisers and justify the high affiliate fees it currently charges. Furthermore, as a politically focused news organization, Fox faces substantial legal and reputational risk stemming from political bias or defamation claims; these threats have materialized recently in large settlements (like the Dominion case), directly harming earnings and potentially deterring advertisers who wish to avoid controversy.

## Company History

This history lesson focuses on the modern Fox Corporation (FOX), which was founded as a distinct business in 2019.

---

### **Part 1: Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **A Company Born from a Sale:** The Fox Corporation that exists today was officially formed on March 19, 2019, but its roots are in the much larger media empire previously known as 21st Century Fox, which was founded by Rupert Murdoch.
2.  **Why the Business Was Founded (The Spin-Off):** The company was born as a necessary consequence of a massive deal: The Walt Disney Company acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets, including the famous movie studio 20th Century Fox, for over $\$71$ billion.
3.  **The Goal of the "New Fox":** The Murdoch family decided to spin off the remaining assets into a new, independent, publicly-traded company—Fox Corporation—with the core strategy to focus on **live news and sports**.
4.  **Core Assets at Inception:** The new company was built around properties that rely on "must-watch" live viewing: Fox News Media (including Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network), the national operations of Fox Sports (including FS1 and FS2), the Fox broadcast network, and the Fox Television Stations.
5.  **Focus on Nimble Operations:** The new company’s leadership, including CEO and Chairman Lachlan Murdoch, described the vision as creating a more **focused and agile** business, unburdened by the film studio and other international assets that Disney had purchased.

### **Part 2: Headwinds (Problems) and Tailwinds (Advantages)**

#### **Headwinds (Challenges Faced)**

1.  **The Cord-Cutting Crisis:** The single biggest challenge for Fox Corporation is the decline of traditional cable and satellite television, known as "cord-cutting."
2.  **Threat to Primary Revenue:** This trend is particularly problematic because a significant portion of the company’s revenue, especially for its profitable cable news channels, comes from **affiliate fees**—the fees that cable companies pay to carry their channels in large bundles.
3.  **Digital Competition:** The company faces intense competition not only from subscription streaming services (like Netflix, Disney+) but also from digital rivals for online advertising dollars.
4.  **High Cost of Live Content:** While live sports is a core advantage, the costs to secure broadcasting rights for major events (like the NFL or college football) have skyrocketed, putting pressure on profit margins.
5.  **Structural and Legal Issues:** The company has dealt with internal challenges, including the abandoned proposal in 2022 to merge back with the other Murdoch company, News Corp, which faced shareholder opposition.

#### **Tailwinds (Advantages and Opportunities)**

1.  **The Value of Live Content:** The core strength of the company is its focus on news and sports, which are among the last forms of television content that viewers *must* watch live, making them extremely valuable to advertisers.
2.  **Fox News Dominance:** Fox News Media has been a dominant cable news channel for many consecutive years, which provides a reliable, high-margin revenue stream through its affiliate fees and strong viewership.
3.  **Local Market Strength:** The network of Fox Television Stations across the U.S. generates strong revenue, particularly from local advertising and fees for carrying the Fox Network's major events, like the Super Bowl.

### **Part 3: Innovative Solutions and Modern Strategy**

1.  **The Tubi Acquisition:** In a key strategic move, Fox acquired the free, ad-supported streaming service **Tubi** in 2020 for a relatively modest $\$440$ million, avoiding the huge costs of launching a new subscription service.
2.  **Focus on AVOD (Ad-Supported Streaming):** This acquisition established an alternative digital strategy by focusing on **Advertising-Based Video On Demand (AVOD)**, which attracts younger audiences who do not want to pay a subscription fee.
3.  **Digital Revenue Engine:** Tubi became a new engine for digital revenue growth, offsetting the losses from traditional pay-TV, and is currently a major part of the company’s digital expansion plan.
4.  **Re-entering Production:** With the major film studios now at Disney, Fox Corporation launched new internal production studios like **Fox Entertainment Studios** and **FOX Alternative Entertainment** to create new, original, and owned content for its broadcast network.
5.  **Digital Sports Expansion:** The company has invested in areas like sports betting and fantasy sports (such as through Fox Bet) to engage with the modern sports fan and create new revenue streams related to its live sports programming.
6.  **Future Streaming Integration:** Fox has also announced plans for new ventures like the "FOX One" streaming service, which aims to bundle its broadcast network and cable channels for cord-cutters in a direct-to-consumer model.

## Moat Analysis

Fox Corporation's (FOX) competitive advantage, or "moat," is primarily built on owning and distributing highly valuable, difficult-to-replicate live content—news and sports—which creates significant leverage over distributors.

### **Analysis of Fox Corporation’s Moat**

1.  **Exclusive, Must-Have Live Content (The Unique Product)**
    *   The core of the moat is the exclusive, long-term contracts for major live sports (like NFL and MLB games) and the market dominance of Fox News.
    *   This content is considered "must-have" for any major television or streaming distributor, as viewers will switch providers to get these specific programs.
    *   The value of live sports and news is that they are watched in real-time, making them less susceptible to the "cord-cutting" trend affecting pre-recorded entertainment.

2.  **Strong Pricing Power and Recurring Revenue**
    *   Fox's unique content allows it to demand high **affiliate fees** from cable, satellite, and live-TV streaming companies (like Comcast and YouTube TV).
    *   These fees are a non-advertising revenue stream that is sticky and recurring, structured under long-term distribution agreements covering the entire portfolio of networks.
    *   Fox News, in particular, has a very loyal following, giving Fox significant leverage to increase these affiliate fees during contract negotiations.

3.  **High Barriers to Entry / Difficulty of Displacement**
    *   Displacing Fox is incredibly difficult due to the enormous **capital required** to purchase equivalent long-term, exclusive rights for major US sports leagues, which cost billions of dollars annually.
    *   Starting a competing 24/7 cable news channel and building an audience with the same dedicated, habitual viewership as Fox News is a massive challenge, even for a well-funded newcomer.
    *   The company's strong balance sheet provides the financial strength to continue acquiring key content and making strategic investments.

4.  **Customer/Contract Stickiness**
    *   **Customers:** The audience for Fox News is highly engaged and loyal, creating an audience base that is unlikely to switch to a competitor.
    *   **Contracts:** Its business-to-business contracts are long-term, multi-year distribution renewal agreements with major pay-TV providers, ensuring a stable, recurring revenue stream.
    *   These agreements not only cover traditional channels but also rights for video-on-demand and "TV Everywhere" apps, extending the stickiness across different platforms.

5.  **Differentiation from Competitors**
    *   Fox's strategy is more resilient than many traditional media peers because it focuses on a less fragmented business: **live news and sports**, rather than high-cost scripted entertainment.
    *   Its competitors are often vying in the expensive, crowded market of subscription video-on-demand (SVOD), while Fox leverages its live content to drive higher advertising and affiliate fee revenue in the declining pay-TV bundle.

6.  **Growth Strategy and Network Effects**
    *   The company is actively developing a digital-focused counter-moat by investing in the **Tubi** streaming service, which is a free, ad-supported platform (FAST).
    *   Tubi’s growth in active users and ad revenue expands Fox's advertising reach into the digital-first market, creating a new and diversified revenue stream.
    *   Its powerful brands (Fox News, Fox Sports) create a positive **network effect** for advertisers, as the high and engaged viewership allows Fox to charge premium rates, which in turn fuels the acquisition of more premium content.

7.  **Innovation and R&D**
    *   Fox Corporation does not typically invest in "R&D" like a tech company, but it must constantly **innovate its distribution** and content delivery to maintain its edge.
    *   Current strategic investments are focused on digital platforms, such as:
        *   Improving content personalization using data and AI.
        *   Developing interactive features for sports broadcasting.
        *   Launching next-generation advertising solutions.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for Fox Corporation (FOX) stock price growth, based on recent company performance, news, and management commentary, can be categorized into near-term and long-term drivers.

### Near-Term Catalysts (0-12 Months)

1.  **Political Advertising Revenue:** The 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle is a major near-term driver, as Fox Corporation's news and local television stations typically see a significant surge in political ad spending.
2.  **Affiliate Fee Growth:** Price increases from recently completed affiliate renewals are consistently offsetting the industry-wide decline in cable subscribers, providing a steady and growing recurring revenue stream for both the Television and Cable segments.
3.  **Share Repurchase Program:** The company's ongoing use of its significant cash flow to repurchase its own stock, including a recent increase in authorization, can help boost Earnings Per Share (EPS) and signal confidence in the company's valuation.
4.  **Major Sports Programming:** Significant sports events broadcast by FOX Sports, such as major soccer tournaments (e.g., UEFA Euro, Copa America) and the ongoing NFL season, drive massive advertising revenue and viewership, though rights costs can occasionally pressure margins.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)

1.  **Tubi's Growth and Monetization:** The company's free ad-supported streaming TV (AVOD) platform, Tubi, continues to show strong organic revenue growth (e.g., 35% year-over-year in Q3 2025), positioning it as a key digital growth engine that attracts younger, ad-supported viewers.
2.  **'FOX One' Streaming Strategy:** The launch of 'FOX One,' a direct-to-consumer (DTC) offering that bundles FOX's properties, alongside the new combined bundle offer with ESPN DTC, aims to retain consumers moving away from traditional cable and establish a new revenue channel.
3.  **Live Sports Portfolio Value:** Management is strategically focused on the enduring and "unmatched power of live sports," which remains in high demand from both advertisers and viewers, securing the long-term value of FOX Sports as the linear TV landscape shifts.

### Management Commentary on Strategy (Recent Earnings Calls)

## Management Record

The management of Fox Corporation (FOX) is a critical factor for investors, as it is led by the influential Murdoch family, who maintain voting control.

### Current Leadership and Background

1.  **Executive Chairman & CEO:** The company is led by **Lachlan K. Murdoch** as the Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer, a role he has held since the company's formation in 2019.
2.  **Executive Succession:** Lachlan became the sole Chair of the board in late 2023, as his father, **Rupert Murdoch**, transitioned from Chairman to **Chairman Emeritus** of both Fox Corporation and News Corp, solidifying Lachlan's control.
3.  **Key Management Team:** The core executive team includes John P. Nallen (President and COO) and Steve Tomsic (CFO), both of whom held senior financial and operational roles at the former 21st Century Fox.
4.  **Family Influence and History:** Lachlan Murdoch has a long history in the family business, but he also notably resigned from News Corp in 2005 and returned to the fold later. He was responsible for a prior business failure, the investment in telecommunications venture One.Tel, which collapsed in 2001.

### Management Performance and Track Record

5.  **Shareholder Returns:** Fox Corporation's management has a strong recent track record in delivering returns, outperforming the S&P 500 over both the trailing twelve months and the last five years (as of late 2025 data).
6.  **Capital Return Commitment:** Management shows a clear commitment to rewarding shareholders through aggressive capital return policies, notably increasing the total share repurchase authorization to **\$12 billion** and consistently raising its semi-annual dividend.
7.  **Key Strategic Decision (The Spinoff):** The current Fox Corporation structure resulted from the 2019 sale of most 21st Century Fox assets to Disney for over \$71 billion, which was a decisive move to focus the remaining company on live news and sports.
8.  **Digital Strategy Success:** A key element of management's success is the investment in and focus on the free, ad-supported streaming service, **Tubi**, which has achieved significant growth and is seen as a cost-effective way to compete in the streaming landscape without "wasting billions" on direct competition with major subscription services.
9.  **Controversial Leadership:** Lachlan's leadership is often associated with the conservative political bent of his father, and he has been involved in defending controversial content, particularly at Fox News. Lachlan's total compensation of approximately \$33 million (as of late 2025 data) is high compared to peers, though it is tied to strong financial performance metrics like EBITDA and EPS growth.
10. **Previous Management and Succession:** The corporate split was a result of the competitive need to sell assets and an underlying succession struggle, as Lachlan and his more moderate brother, James Murdoch, reportedly had differing visions for the future of the media empire.

### Future Strategy and Vision

11. **Core Focus:** The company's strategic vision revolves around **Content Leadership, Digital Growth, and Operational Efficiency**, aiming to generate long-term value for shareholders through its core business of producing and distributing compelling news, sports, and entertainment.
12. **Live Content Reliance:** The strategy is heavily weighted toward its iconic domestic brands, including FOX News Media, FOX Sports, and its Television Stations, which all focus on **live, culturally significant content** that commands high value for advertisers and distributors.
13. **Digital-First Push:** Management views its digital transformation, centered around growing Tubi and other digital platforms, as a core strategic pillar for scalable growth and attracting younger viewers, making the company a "rare media stock with a clear path to sustainable growth."
14. **Flexibility and Acquisitions:** Fox maintains one of the most robust balance sheets in the industry, which management intends to leverage for ongoing capital returns to shareholders and to pursue "value accretive investment" and strategic acquisition opportunities in the media categories where they operate.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Fox Corporation's (FOX) compensation and governance structure, the management incentives are largely aligned with shareholder interests, though the high insider/family control introduces a dominant factor in the overall governance.

### Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation (FOX)

1.  **High Insider Ownership for Alignment:** The company has a significantly high overall insider ownership, with approximately 34.84% to 37.21% of the company's stock held by insiders. Specifically, Lachlan K. Murdoch, the Executive Chair and CEO, is the largest individual shareholder and controls the company through a family trust that holds about **36% of the voting shares**. This substantial controlling interest provides a powerful, inherent incentive for the dominant managerial figure to act in the company's long-term interest.

2.  **Performance-Driven Compensation Structure:** The compensation structure for named executive officers (NEOs) is heavily weighted toward variable, performance-based compensation. In a recent fiscal year, variable compensation accounted for **81% of target direct compensation** for NEOs, rising to **85% for the CEO**. This low reliance on fixed salary and heavy reliance on performance pay aligns management's focus with business results.

3.  **Use of Long-Term Equity and Financial Metrics:** Long-term incentives (LTI) are primarily granted as equity awards, including Performance-Based Stock Units (PSUs) and Performance Stock Options (PSOs), which reward sustained performance over a multi-year period. Key performance metrics for incentives include financial measures like **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Adjusted EPS growth**, directly linking executive payouts to the company's financial success.

4.  **Payouts Directly Correlated to Performance:** Compensation increases for executives were a direct result of exceeding performance targets; for instance, the quantitative portion of the annual incentive plan recently paid out at **179% of target**, and three-year PSUs vested at **198% of target** due to strong financial and operational performance. This demonstrates that a large portion of executive pay is genuinely at risk and contingent on achieving high targets.

5.  **Mandatory Stock Ownership and Anti-Risk Policies:** The company enforces mandatory stock ownership guidelines: the CEO is required to own equity valued at **6 times his base salary**, and other NEOs are required to own equity valued at **2 times their base salary**. Furthermore, the company explicitly **prohibits all directors and employees from hedging or pledging** company securities, preventing them from mitigating the personal financial risk of stock ownership.

### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

*   **Management is highly incentivized to act in the interest of the controlling shareholders (the Murdoch family).** The family's significant direct ownership (36% voting control) means their interests and the long-term success of the company are fundamentally intertwined.
*   **The compensation structure generally aligns the interests of all executives with shareholder value creation.** The very high percentage of pay that is variable and linked to measurable financial performance and stock-based metrics (EBITDA, EPS growth, stock price) minimizes the incentive to "line their own pockets" purely through fixed salaries, instead forcing them to create value for a payout.
*   **Robust governance mechanisms** such as mandatory stock ownership and the prohibition on hedging further solidify the alignment, ensuring executives have skin in the game and feel the direct impact of stock price movements.

## Price History

Based on the recent price history and technical analysis, here is an analysis of Fox Corporation's (FOX) stock.

### FOX Corporation Stock Price Analysis

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Fox Corporation (FOXA) is currently trading significantly above its 52-week low. With a recent price around $62.88 and a 52-week low of $41.13, the stock is approximately **52.88%** above its low for the past year.

2.  **Is the Stock Trading Low (Technical Analysis):** Based on technical indicators, Fox Corporation is **not trading low**; it is currently considered to be in a strong uptrend. Multiple technical indicators, including its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, show a **"Buy" or "Strong Buy"** signal, as the current price is trading above these key levels.

3.  **Recent Price Highs:** The stock has seen a major rise over the last year, with Class A shares reaching a record high of $62.69 and Class B shares hitting an all-time high of $57.02 recently. This strong performance reflects robust investor confidence and market momentum.

Furthermore, the company demonstrated solid fundamentals with a 55.6% dividend increase and a strong financial health score.

---

## Long Thesis

Fox is uniquely positioned because it focuses exclusively on must-watch live content: dominant news and major sports (like the NFL). This rare content allows Fox to keep raising the fees it charges cable companies, providing stable, high revenue. While cable shrinks, Fox is aggressively building its digital future through its free streaming platform, Tubi. Tubi is growing fast, capturing younger audiences and new digital advertising dollars, which successfully offsets any losses from cable TV decline. In the near term, massive political advertising spending during election cycles and aggressive stock buybacks will strongly boost profits. In the long term, the combination of irreplaceable live content and a successful, profitable digital platform ensures sustainable growth and resilience, making Fox a resilient media player.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

Tubi must continue to grow its audience and revenue rapidly, proving it can fully replace declining cable income. Fox must successfully renew and retain its expensive, core sports broadcasting rights (like the NFL) against aggressive tech competitors. Affiliate fee increases must remain high enough to financially offset the accelerating number of people canceling cable subscriptions. Management must continue to effectively use its high cash flow for large share buybacks to increase earnings per share. Finally, the company must manage its significant political and legal risks without further costly settlements or major reputational damage that could scare away advertisers.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This is a critique and bear case thesis against the bullish position on Fox Corporation (FOX). The bear case highlights the flaws in the assumptions regarding the transition from cable to digital, the cost structure of its "irreplaceable" content, and its unquantified risk exposure.

### **Bear Case Thesis: Flaws and Holes in the Fox Long Thesis**

#### **1. The Core Business Decline is Accelerating Faster than Digital Offsets**

*   **Affiliate Fee Illusion:** The claim that high affiliate fee increases will sufficiently offset cord-cutting is becoming increasingly tenuous. While Fox's affiliate revenue is still growing in the low single digits (e.g., 1-5% in recent quarters), this growth is constantly noted in financial reports as being **offset by net subscriber declines**. The pay-TV subscriber base is shrinking rapidly, with one report showing a loss of over 5 million subscribers between Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and cord-cutting households now outnumbering pay-TV households for the first time in 2023. This suggests the ability to enforce steep fee increases will eventually hit a wall as distributors fight back and the addressable market shrinks further.
*   **Tubi's Scale vs. Cable Loss:** The bullish argument that Tubi's growth will "fully replace declining cable income" is questionable based on current scale. While Tubi is growing revenue (e.g., 22-30% year-over-year in recent quarters), its projected 2024 annual ad revenue is around \$1 billion. This must replace a core cable segment that generates multiple billions in affiliate and advertising revenue *per quarter*, indicating a significant and potentially unbridgeable revenue gap for the foreseeable future.

#### **2. Irreplaceable Live Content Has an Exploding, Unsustainable Cost Structure**

*   **Soaring Sports Rights Costs:** Fox's "irreplaceable live content" (NFL, etc.) is protected for now, but the **cost to secure these rights is exploding**, challenging the premise of "stable, high revenue." Fox is committed to paying over \$2 billion annually for its current NFL package, which is part of a total league rights deal that roughly doubled in value to \$110 billion and runs through the 2033 season.
*   **Aggressive Tech Competition is Fact, Not Future Risk:** The competition from "aggressive tech competitors" (e.g., Amazon, YouTube, Netflix) is already here, driving up prices for marquee sports content, securing exclusive games, and prompting the NFL to consider opt-outs as early as next year (2026) to negotiate for even higher fees. Fox faces massive renewal price hikes in the late 2020s and early 2030s that will put immense pressure on its margins.
*   **Content Mismatch (Tubi vs. Sports):** Tubi's strategy is currently focused on on-demand entertainment, and management has explicitly stated they do not plan to bring core live sports into the platform anytime soon. This prevents the flagship sports content from serving as a primary accelerator for Tubi's revenue growth or as a direct offset for the high rights costs, undermining the synergy between their "core content" and "digital future."

#### **3. Unquantified Legal and Reputational Risks**

*   **Multi-Billion Dollar Legal Overhang:** The \$787.5 million Dominion Voting Systems settlement, which was more than half of the company's profit in the prior year, was not the end of Fox's legal exposure. The company still faces a larger, **\$2.7 billion defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic**, a clear and present financial risk that could severely impact cash flow and management focus, directly contradicting the assumption that legal risks can be "managed without further costly settlements."
*   **Short-Lived Political Ad Boost:** While political advertising in an election year provides a temporary "strong boost to profits," this is cyclical and non-sustainable revenue. The underlying business decline and large legal liabilities could potentially overshadow this temporary boost, and the reputational fallout from recent high-profile lawsuits risks scaring away a broader base of national advertisers.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the primary debate revolves around the *magnitude* of the decline in the core business versus the *pace* and *profitability* of the digital offset. The largest external risk is the unquantified legal liability.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for investigation:

### **1. Quantifying the Legal Overhang (Smartmatic Lawsuit)**

The $2.7 billion Smartmatic lawsuit is a major unquantified risk that could severely impact cash flow and management focus, directly validating the bear thesis.

*   **Next Step:** Although a trial date is not yet set, the New York appeals court has ruled that Fox Corporation must face trial, which is a significant development. The most recent filings show the litigation is highly contentious, with both sides accusing the other of deleting evidence, and Smartmatic continuing to argue Fox executives knew the claims were false.
*   **Questions to Ask:** Are there any recent *analyst models* or *legal expert projections* that estimate the likely settlement range or maximum credible loss for the Smartmatic case? The $2.7 billion is the claim amount, but what is the *expected* liability?

### **2. Assessing Tubi's Digital Scale vs. Cable Decline**

The long thesis requires Tubi to rapidly replace traditional revenue. The bear thesis questions the scale. The search results provide necessary context to frame this financial comparison.

*   **Tubi's Profitability:** The free ad-supported streaming service (FAST) is set to generate around **$1 billion** in annual revenue (based on fiscal 2024 and 2025 projections). Crucially, the CFO noted that Tubi generated a pre-tax loss of approximately **$240 million** in the last fiscal year, and the goal is to reach break-even and generate positive margins.
*   **Cable vs. Tubi Revenue:** In a recent quarter (Q1 2025), the cable network programming segment alone generated about **$1.037 billion** in affiliate fee revenue. Tubi's $1 billion **annual** revenue is still small compared to the **multi-billion dollar** annual revenue base of the cable segment (which includes both affiliate fees and advertising).

*   **Next Step:** Investigate the forward guidance for Tubi's margin improvement.
*   **Questions to Ask:** When does management officially expect Tubi to reach **EBITDA or cash flow break-even**? Does the current loss rate require a significant upward revision of its expected time to profitability, or does the strong revenue growth still support the long-term thesis?

### **3. Stress-Testing the Core Affiliate Fee Strategy**

The core moat is the ability to raise affiliate fees to offset subscriber losses. The search results show a close fight.

*   **Affiliate Fee vs. Subscriber Data:** Fox is in a rare position, showing linear affiliate revenue gains when most peers are in decline. Total affiliate fees rose 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. However, in a 2023 financial report, the Cable segment's 2% affiliate fee revenue decline was attributed to **subscriber losses of 8%** more than offsetting the fee increases. More recently, the cable segment was still being impacted by subscriber declines of around 6.5%.
*   **Next Step:** Find the latest segment-specific subscriber data and the expected rate of affiliate fee hikes.
*   **Questions to Ask:** What is the **current, expected long-term linear subscriber decline rate** that Fox's *internal models* are using (e.g., 5% to 6% per year)? At what rate must affiliate fees increase annually (e.g., 8% to 10%) to maintain low-single-digit affiliate revenue *growth* given this decline?

### **4. Identifying the Next Content Rights Cost Hurdle**

The bear case highlights exploding sports rights costs. While the NFL is secure, the next major contract renewal will test the "moat" against deep-pocketed tech rivals.

*   **Next Step:** Identify the nearest major sports contract renewal deadline, as the current NFL deal runs through 2033.
*   **Questions to Ask:** When are Fox's major agreements for **MLB (Major League Baseball)**, **NASCAR**, or its core **College Football** packages set to expire? This will identify the next inevitable cash outlay and margin pressure point.
