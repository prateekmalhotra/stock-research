## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The business engine of Minerals Technologies is split into two main segments:
1.  **Consumer & Specialties:** Driven by steady growth in the Household & Personal Care product line (especially cat litter, edible oil, and renewable fuel purification) and expansion in high-growth markets like Asia, which is offsetting mixed or soft conditions in other areas like North American cat litter and European paper. [cite: 1, 6 in previous step, 10 in previous step] The company is making strategic investments that will contribute to near- and long-term growth.
2.  **Engineered Solutions:** Driven by infrastructure-related activity (environmental & infrastructure products, offshore services) and stable US steel/foundry markets, with weakness in Europe/Middle East steel and seasonality in construction. [cite: 1, 6 in previous step, 10 in previous step]

Management is "optimistic" and expects a stronger second half of 2025, with overall sales growth driven by organic initiatives and new product lines.

### **2.1. 2025 Revenue (Base Year Calculation)**

The 2025 revenue is calculated using Q1-Q3 results and the Q4 guidance midpoint:

| Quarter | Sales (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Q1 2025 | $492.0 | Reported Q1 2025 net sales. [cite: 6 in previous step] |
| Q2 2025 | $528.9 | Reported Q2 2025 net sales. [cite: 5 in previous step] |
| Q3 2025 | $532.4 | Reported Q3 2025 net sales. [cite: 3 in previous step] |
| Q4 2025 (Guidance Midpoint) | $517.5 | Midpoint of $510M to $525M guidance. [cite: 10 in previous step] |
| **Total 2025 Projected Revenue** | **$2,070.8** | Sum of Q1-Q4 |

### **2.2. Revenue Growth Assumptions (2026-2030)**

Given the mixed, but fundamentally positive, growth drivers (consumer staples-like demand in cat litter/personal care, and strong infrastructure pull), but balanced against industrial cyclicality (steel, construction), the following conservative growth rates are assumed:

*   **2026:** 3.0% (Rebound from mixed 2025, benefiting from the full-year run-rate of **$10 million annualized cost savings** initiated in Q1 2025, and continued traction in growth initiatives). [cite: 6 in previous step]
*   **2027-2030:** 2.5% (A sustained, conservative growth rate representing market share gains, Asia expansion, and a modest inflationary price component).

| Year | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **$2,070.8** | N/A | Calculated from Q1-Q3 actuals + Q4 midpoint guidance. |
| **2026** | **$2,132.9** | 3.0% | Conservative growth, incorporating full impact of 2025 growth initiatives and market stabilization. [cite: 1, 6 in previous step] |
| **2027** | **$2,186.2** | 2.5% | Long-term conservative growth based on core demand and specialty mineral applications. |
| **2028** | **$2,240.9** | 2.5% | Continued modest, sustained organic growth. |
| **2029** | **$2,296.9** | 2.5% | Continued modest, sustained organic growth. |
| **2030** | **$2,354.3** | 2.5% | Final explicit forecast year. |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

### **3.1. Margin Assumptions**

*   **Operating Margin (Adjusted):** The company had a 14.9% margin in 2024 and is guiding for margins in the 13-14% range for 2025 (Q1: 12.9%, Q2: 14.1%, Q3: 14.7% ex-special items, Q4: ~13.0% midpoint). [cite: 1, 5 in previous step, 6 in previous step] Management is focused on margin improvement, mitigating cost increases, and achieving cost savings. [cite: 2 in previous step]
    *   **Assumption:** A conservative, gradual improvement is assumed, reflecting the company's focus and the full realization of cost savings by early 2026.
*   **Interest Expense (Estimated):** $57.5 million (6.0% estimated interest rate on $957.8M debt).
*   **Tax Rate (Estimated):** 25.0% (Conservative blended federal/state corporate tax rate, as the statutory rate is not explicitly provided in snippets).

| Year | Operating Margin % | Operating Income | Interest Expense (Est.) | EBT (PBT) | Tax (25.0%) | Net Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 13.7% | $283.1 | $57.5 | $225.6 | $56.4 | **$169.2** |
| **2026** | 14.0% | $298.6 | $57.5 | $241.1 | $60.3 | **$180.8** |
| **2027** | 14.2% | $310.5 | $57.5 | $253.0 | $63.3 | **$189.8** |
| **2028** | 14.4% | $322.7 | $57.5 | $265.2 | $66.3 | **$198.9** |
| **2029** | 14.6% | $335.2 | $57.5 | $277.7 | $69.4 | **$208.3** |
| **2030** | 14.8% | $348.4 | $57.5 | $290.9 | $72.7 | **$218.2** |

*Note: The 2025 Operating Income is the **Adjusted Operating Income** calculated from Q1-Q4 data (\$283.1M).*

### **3.2. Cash Flow and ROIC Projection**

The rule dictates: *Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage based on the past to get additional income for the next year.*

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Return on Equity (ROE) in Q3 2025 was approximately 10.70%. [cite: 4 in previous step] ROIC is often a lower, more conservative metric than ROE. I will use a conservative but reasonable ROIC of **8.0%** to generate incremental income from the accumulated cash (prior year's Net Income). This is conservative for a specialty minerals company focused on high-margin growth.

| Year | Net Income (A) | Acc. Cash from Prior NI (B) | ROIC Income (B * 8.0%) (C) | Total NI for DCF (A + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $169.2 | $0.0 | $0.0 | **$169.2** |
| **2026** | $180.8 | $169.2 | $13.5 | **$194.3** |
| **2027** | $189.8 | $350.0 | $28.0 | **$217.8** |
| **2028** | $198.9 | $567.8 | $45.4 | **$244.3** |
| **2029** | $208.3 | $812.1 | $65.0 | **$273.3** |
| **2030** | $218.2 | $1,085.4 | $86.8 | **$305.0** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### **4.1. Rate Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** I will use a conservative but reasonable **9.0%**. This is justified by the company's relatively low net leverage ratio (1.6x Adjusted EBITDA as of 2024), debt refinancing in 2024, and stable, yet cyclical, business model. [cite: 2, 4 in previous step]
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** I will use a very conservative **2.0%**. This is well below the long-term historical GDP growth and is appropriate for a mature, global specialty chemicals/minerals company.

### **4.2. Present Value Calculation**

| Year | Total NI for DCF (Future Cash Flow) (A) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | $169.2 | 0.9174 | $155.2 |
| 2026 | $194.3 | 0.8417 | $163.5 |
| 2027 | $217.8 | 0.7722 | $168.2 |
| 2028 | $244.3 | 0.7084 | $173.0 |
| 2029 | $273.3 | 0.6499 | $177.6 |
| 2030 | $305.0 | 0.5963 | $181.9 |
| **Sum of Explicit Cash Flows (NPV1)** | | | **$1,019.4** |

### **4.3. Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all future cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%.

**Terminal Cash Flow (2031):** $305.0 * (1 + 0.02) = $311.1 Million

**Terminal Value (at end of 2030):** (Terminal Cash Flow / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate))
TV = $311.1 / (0.09 - 0.02) = $4,444.3 Million

**Terminal Value Net Present Value (NPV2):**
TV NPV = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (2030)
TV NPV = $4,444.3 * 0.5963 = **$2,648.7 Million**

### **4.4. Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

**Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** = NPV1 + NPV2
Total NPV = $1,019.4 + $2,648.7 = **$3,668.1 Million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### **5.1. Fair Value Per Share**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (TEV)** | $3,668.1 |
| Less: **Total Debt** | $957.8 |
| Plus: **Total Cash & Equivalents** | $328.3 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$3,038.6** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 31.134 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$97.60** |

### **5.2. Valuation Summary**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$97.60** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **$59.61** |
| **Difference (Undervalued)** | **63.7%** |

### **5.3. Justification of the Difference**

The calculated Fair Value of **$97.60** is significantly higher (63.7% premium) than the Current Market Price of **$59.61**. This large difference suggests the market is making a far more conservative assumption about the company's future performance or is heavily discounting for an unquantified risk.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions (Why the stock is low):**

1.  **Litigation Risk & Uncertainty:** The largest factor is the **$215 million litigation reserve** for talc-related claims recorded in Q1 2025, which drove a large net loss for the first nine months of the year. [cite: 3 in previous step, 6 in previous step] The market is likely pricing in:
    *   The risk of the final settlement cost being **higher** than the current reserve.
    *   Ongoing negative news flow and legal costs related to the subsidiary's Chapter 11 case.
    *   A perception of high long-term business risk related to talc, even with a ring-fenced subsidiary.
    *   This is a real, measurable risk that DCF models often fail to capture adequately if a "clean" adjusted net income is used.

2.  **Conservative Growth and Margin:** The market may be assuming:
    *   **Lower/Negative Growth:** The $2.1B 2024 revenue was a 2% decline from the prior year, and 2025's revenue is also projected to decline slightly to $2.07B. [cite: 1, 2 in previous step, 3 in previous step] The market might see the recent *mixed market conditions* (Europe weakness, construction softness) as a persistent headwind, leading to a much lower growth rate (e.g., 0% - 1%) and a lower maturity rate (e.g., 0%).
    *   **Higher Discount Rate:** The market may be using a higher WACC (e.g., 10-11%) due to the aforementioned legal/litigation risk, which increases the required return.

**Justification of the DCF Assumptions (Why the calculated value is high):**

My valuation is fundamentally based on the belief that the company's **underlying business is robust and is being masked by one-time special items**.

1.  **Adjusted Operating Performance:** The valuation uses **Adjusted Operating Income** (excluding special items) for 2025-2030, which the company reported as a record performance in 2024, showing strong margins and earnings power before the litigation reserve. This assumes the $215M reserve is a one-time "clean-up" cost and that future special items will not recur at this magnitude.
2.  **Growth Engine Credibility:** The conservative 2.5% - 3.0% growth is directly supported by the management's focus on:
    *   Consumer staples-like growth (cat litter, personal care).
    *   High-growth regions (Asia expansion).
    *   Infrastructure tailwinds (Engineered Solutions).
    *   The valuation assumes the investments and initiatives will deliver steady, moderate growth as management guides.
3.  **Conservative ROIC:** The 8.0% ROIC assumption is conservative compared to the historical ROE (10.70%), providing a safety margin for the reinvested cash flow. [cite: 4 in previous step]

**Conclusion on Valuation:**

The significant difference suggests that the market is heavily discounting MTX for the **litigation and talc-related bankruptcy risk** and, to a lesser extent, the recent end-market cyclicality. The calculated fair value of **$97.60** represents the intrinsic value of the business **assuming the litigation risk is fully contained by the current reserves and the adjusted profitability is sustainable and growing** as management plans. An investor would be betting on the successful resolution of the BMI OldCo Chapter 11 case and the subsequent re-rating of the stock based on its "clean" core earnings power.
