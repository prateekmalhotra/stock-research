## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Minerals Technologies Inc. operates through two main segments: **Consumer & Specialties (C&S)** and **Engineered Solutions (ES)**. The revenue projection is built on management's commentary regarding segment-specific growth drivers.

### Business Engine Assumptions

| Segment/Driver | Management Commentary/Evidence | Assumption for Projection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consumer & Specialties** | Double-digit growth in high-margin specialty applications (edible oil, animal health) and strong cat litter volumes. Global expansion with new paper/packaging satellites in Asia. | **Growth Rate:** Higher, reflecting success in high-growth, consumer-oriented specialty products and new capacity coming online in Asia. |
| **Engineered Solutions** | Mixed industrial markets (soft North America foundry) but strong North America steel and growth in infrastructure drilling and offshore water filtration. Industrial cyclicality. | **Growth Rate:** Moderate, acknowledging mixed industrial demand and cyclical pressures, but supported by specialized technologies (e.g., MINscan) and infrastructure spending. |
| **Overall** | Management is making strategic investments in Household & Personal Care for near- and long-term growth. | **Conservative Estimate:** The total weighted average growth rate should be modest, reflecting MTI's position in the specialty chemicals/basic materials industry, but benefitting from consumer-driven high-margin products. |

### Revenue Breakdown and Projections (in millions USD)

Based on Q3 2025 data, C&S sales were $277M and ES sales were $255M, implying an approximate 52% C&S and 48% ES mix for the quarter. We will apply this mix to the full-year 2025 revenue of $2,100M as a baseline.

| Year | C&S Revenue (4.5% Growth) | ES Revenue (3.0% Growth) | **Total Revenue** | YoY Growth % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | $1,092.0 | $1,008.0 | **$2,100.0** | N/A |
| **2026** | $1,141.2 | $1,038.2 | **$2,179.4** | 3.8% |
| **2027** | $1,192.5 | $1,069.4 | **$2,261.9** | 3.8% |
| **2028** | $1,246.1 | $1,101.5 | **$2,347.6** | 3.8% |
| **2029** | $1,302.0 | $1,134.5 | **$2,436.5** | 3.8% |
| **2030** | $1,360.6 | $1,168.6 | **$2,529.2** | 3.8% |

*   **C&S Conservative Growth Rate:** **4.5%** (A conservative interpretation of "double-digit growth" in key sub-segments and new capacity, balanced by overall segment performance).
*   **ES Conservative Growth Rate:** **3.0%** (Slightly above long-term GDP growth, acknowledging industrial cyclicality but maintaining a positive outlook from infrastructure/specialized sales).
*   **Weighted Average Growth:** Approximately 3.8% annually (conservative and reasonable for a specialty materials company).

## 3. Margin, Net Income, and Cash Flow Projections

### Margin Projections

| Metric | Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating Margin (%)** | **14.5%** | Conservative estimate, slightly below the "natural level of 15%" cited by management [cite: 16 (from previous search), 7], to account for potential volume pressures and litigation-related costs. |
| **Effective Tax Rate (%)** | **25.0%** | A conservative, reasonable estimate based on the US statutory rate and global operations. |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | **9.0%** | Derived from Operating Income Margin: Assuming 14.5% Operating Margin, $\sim$1.5% for Net Interest Expense (on $957.8M debt at a conservative 5% rate is $\sim$48M / \$2,100M revenue = 2.3%), and then applying the 25.0% tax rate. $14.5\% - 2.3\% = 12.2\%$ Pre-Tax Margin. $12.2\% \times (1 - 0.25) \approx 9.2\%$. We will use a conservative **9.0%**. |

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

*   **ROIC Assumption:** **5.0%**
*   **Justification:** The company has a good net leverage ratio (1.7x EBITDA, below target) [cite: 13 (from previous search), 16 (from previous search)] and is making strategic investments in high-growth areas. A 5.0% ROIC is a conservative, yet positive and reasonable, figure for a company with profitable operations and growth initiatives in the specialty chemicals sector, in line with the valuation rule.

### Projected Net Income and Cash Flow (in millions USD)

| Year | Total Revenue | Net Income (9.0% Margin) | Previous NI added to Cash | ROIC Income (5.0% of Previous NI) | **Total Cash Flow (for DCF)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | $2,100.0 | $189.0 | N/A | N/A | $189.0$ |
| **2026** | $2,179.4 | $196.1$ | $189.0$ | $9.5$ | **$205.6** |
| **2027** | $2,261.9$ | $203.6$ | $205.6$ | $10.3$ | **$213.9** |
| **2028** | $2,347.6$ | $211.3$ | $213.9$ | $10.7$ | **$222.0** |
| **2029** | $2,436.5$ | $219.3$ | $222.0$ | $11.1$ | **$230.4** |
| **2030** | $2,529.2$ | $227.6$ | $230.4$ | $11.5$ | **$239.1** |

*   *Total Cash Flow* is calculated as: *Net Income from that year + ROIC from Net Income added to cash from previous year.* This adheres to the rule: "net income for next year = net income from that year... + ROIC from net income got from previous year."

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Parameters

| Metric | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate for a specialty materials company with stable operations and moderate debt. This reflects the required return on an investment in the business. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative rate, in line with long-term US GDP or inflation estimates, which is appropriate for a mature, cyclical basic materials company. |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated for the projected cash flows from 2026 through 2030, and the Terminal Value (TV).

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^5 \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1+r)^5}
$$

Where:
*   $CF_t$ is the Cash Flow in year $t$.
*   $r$ is the Discount Rate (9.0%).
*   $TV$ is the Terminal Value, calculated as: $\text{TV} = \frac{\text{CF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}} = \frac{\$239.1 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \$3,485.4 \text{ million}$

| Year | Cash Flow (CF) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $205.6 | 0.9174 | $188.6 |
| **2027** | $213.9 | 0.8417 | $180.0 |
| **2028** | $222.0 | 0.7722 | $171.4 |
| **2029** | $230.4 | 0.7084 | $163.2 |
| **2030** | $239.1$ | 0.6500 | $155.4 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | $3,485.4$ | 0.6500 | $2,265.5$ |
| | | | **Sum of NPV** |
| | | | **$3,124.1$** |

*   **Total Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value):** **$3,124.1 million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value per Share

The fair value of equity is calculated by subtracting Total Debt and adding Total Cash from the Total NPV (Enterprise Value), and then dividing by the Shares Outstanding.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV (Enterprise Value)** | $3,124.1$ |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $957.8$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | $328.3$ |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$2,494.6** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | $31.13$ |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$80.13** |

### Conclusion

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (Calculated)** | **$80.13** |
| **Current Market Price (Feb 2026)** | **$73.05** |
| **Difference** | **+9.7%** |

## 6. Justification and Market Interpretation

The calculated **Fair Value of $80.13 per share** is approximately **9.7% higher** than the current market price of $73.05. This small difference suggests that the market's assumptions about Minerals Technologies Inc.'s future are largely aligned with this conservative fundamental valuation.

### Justification for Assumptions

1.  **Revenue Growth (3.8% Weighted Average):** This is a conservative yet justified assumption. The company is actively investing and seeing double-digit growth in key, high-margin, consumer-driven sub-segments (cat litter, edible oil purification, animal health). This growth offsets the more cyclical and softer industrial demand in some High-Temperature Technologies product lines. The market is likely pricing in a similar, low-single-digit long-term growth rate.
2.  **Net Income Margin (9.0%):** This is based on management's stated "natural level" of 15% operating margin [cite: 16 (from previous search)] minus conservative interest and tax estimates. The margin is slightly conservative to account for litigation reserves ($215.0 million provision in Q1 2025) which have pressured historical Net Income, but which are excluded from the projected *ongoing* operating business.
3.  **Conservative DCF Parameters (9.0% Discount Rate, 2.0% Terminal Growth):** These rates are conservative and typical for a mature specialty materials company. A lower Discount Rate or a higher Terminal Growth Rate would significantly increase the valuation, suggesting the market is using similar or slightly more aggressive figures than these very conservative ones.

### Market Interpretation

The market is currently valuing MTX at $73.05, very close to the calculated Fair Value of $80.13.

*   **What the Market is Assuming:** The market is essentially making the same conservative assumptions as this DCF: a long-term revenue growth in the 3-4% range, sustainable operating margins around 14.5% to 15%, and a reasonable cost of capital.
*   **Why the Small Difference Exists:** The slight undervaluation (according to this model) suggests the market may be applying a higher risk premium (i.e., a slightly higher discount rate, perhaps 9.5-10.0%) due to:
    *   **Litigation Risk:** Continued concern over the talc litigation, despite the Q1 2025 provision, as future legal costs are difficult to predict.
    *   **Industrial Cyclicality:** Greater skepticism about the sustainability of the 3.0% growth in the Engineered Solutions segment given recent softness in North American foundry and residential construction.

Our valuation is higher because we are using management's long-term operating margin target and a conservative, but positive, 5.0% ROIC on reinvested earnings, which provides a clean and systematic method of cash generation beyond simple top-line growth. The market's slight discount is a reasonable reflection of the qualitative risks (litigation, cyclicality) inherent in the business.
