| **Shares Outstanding** | **31.2 million** | Conservative average based on recent filing disclosures (e.g., 31,134,308-31,300,000 range). [cite: 2 (from step 1), 3 (from step 1), 5 (from step 1)] |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (C&CE)** | **$319.6** | Balance sheet figure as of December 31, 2025 (estimated from Q3 2025 filing balance sheet snippet). [cite: 1 (from step 4)] |
| **Total Debt** | **$957.8** | Q3 2025 Long-term debt figure used as a conservative proxy for Total Debt (assuming minimal short-term debt). [cite: 3 (from step 2)] |
| **2025 Net Sales (Base)** | **$2,073** | Full-year 2025 worldwide net sales (adjusted figure of $2.1 billion used for projection base is very close). [cite: 5 (from step 2)] |
| **2025 Adjusted Net Income (Base)** | **$172.2** | Calculated from 2025 Adjusted EPS of $5.52 $\times$ 31.2 million shares. This is used as the base as the reported net loss was due to a significant, non-recurring $215M talc-related legal provision. [cite: 2 (from step 3)] |

## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection Justification

Minerals Technologies Inc. operates primarily in two segments: **Consumer & Specialties (C&S)** and **Engineered Solutions (ES)**.

*   **C&S Engine:** Driven by stable-to-growing consumer markets (cat litter, personal care, edible oil/renewable fuel purification, and animal health). The segment is supported by innovation and capacity expansion (e.g., cat litter volume improvements in H2 2025). [cite: 2 (from step 3), 5 (from step 2)]
*   **ES Engine:** Driven by industrial end markets (High-Temperature Technologies for steel/foundry, and Environmental & Infrastructure). This segment faces cyclicality, with recent softness in North American heavy truck/agricultural foundry and European steel markets, but is seeing growth in Asia foundry and environmental lining systems/offshore water treatment. [cite: 2 (from step 3)]

**Management Guidance & Conservative Assumptions:**
*   **2026 Guidance:** Mid-single-digit organic growth (e.g., 5.0%) plus a target of **$50 million in new revenue** from growth investments. [cite: 1 (from step 2)]
*   **Long-Term Conservatism:** I assume strong initial growth as management's new projects come online, followed by a conservative slowdown to reflect global industrial/commodity cyclicality and macro uncertainty.

| Year | Revenue Projection (in millions) | Year-over-Year Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual/Base)** | **$2,073.0** | - | Full Year 2025 Net Sales (Reported $\approx$ Adjusted). [cite: 5 (from step 2)] |
| **2026** | **$2,226.7** | 7.4% | **5.0% Organic Growth** ($\approx$\$103.7M) + **\$50M from New Initiatives** (Management Guidance). [cite: 1 (from step 2)] |
| **2027** | **$2,338.0** | 5.0% | Reflects sustained mid-single-digit growth from new products/markets, with industrial markets moderately recovering. |
| **2028** | **$2,455.0** | 5.0% | Assumes full-cycle recovery in industrial (ES) and continued stable growth in consumer (C&S). |
| **2029** | **$2,553.2** | 4.0% | Conservative step-down to a sustainable, low-to-mid-single-digit growth rate. |
| **2030** | **$2,655.3** | 4.0% | Maintained conservative long-term growth rate. |

## 3. Net Income & ROIC Projection Justification

**Margin Projection:**
*   2025 Adjusted Operating Margin was 13.9%. [cite: 1 (from step 2)]
*   Management is confident in **margin recovery towards 15%** (Operating Margin). [cite: 1 (from step 2)]
*   I will assume a Net Income Margin (Adj. Net Income/Sales) that steps up towards a target of **8.5%** by 2028 and holds steady. (2025 Base Net Income Margin: $172.2M / $2,073M = 8.3%).

**ROIC & Reinvestment:**
*   The valuation rule requires: Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.
*   Given the complexity of calculating historical ROIC from available fragmented data, and the need for a **conservative but reasonable positive ROIC**, I will assume an ROIC of **8.0%** on the retained cash flow (Net Income). This rate is conservative for a specialty chemicals company but reflects potential cyclicality and conservative nature of the projection.

**Taxes:** I will use a conservative effective tax rate of **25.0%** to convert Operating Income to Net Income (before the ROIC calculation).

### Net Income Projection (in millions)

| Year | Net Sales | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Operations (A) | ROIC % | Net Income from Previous Year's Cash (B) | Total Projected Net Income (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | $2,073.0 | 8.3% (Actual) | $172.2 | - | - | **$172.2** |
| **2026** | $2,226.7 | 8.4% | $187.0 | 8.0% | $13.8 | **$200.8** |
| **2027** | $2,338.0 | 8.5% | $198.7 | 8.0% | $16.1 | **$214.8** |
| **2028** | $2,455.0 | 8.5% | $208.7 | 8.0% | $17.2 | **$225.9** |
| **2029** | $2,553.2 | 8.5% | $217.0 | 8.0% | $18.1 | **$235.1** |
| **2030** | $2,655.3 | 8.5% | $225.7 | 8.0% | $18.8 | **$244.5** |

*(Net Income from Previous Year's Cash (B) = Previous Year's Total Net Income $\times$ ROIC % $\times$ (1 - Tax Rate) - This is a conservative implementation of the rule where a portion of net income goes to tax and the remainder to cash for next year's ROIC. The rule states: "net income for next year = net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year". For simplicity, I calculate the ROIC on the full NI, as the rule implies the *entire* Net Income from the prior year flows to cash and generates the ROIC income for the *current* year. $172.2 \times 8.0\% \approx 13.8$.)*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Total Projected Net Income is used as the **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)** for this DCF valuation.

**Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **10.0%**. A conservative rate reflecting the cyclicality of the industrial/materials sector and the cost of debt/equity for a company with $\sim$1.7x net leverage.
*   **Terminal Value (Maturity) Rate (Conservative):** **2.5%**. A conservative long-term growth rate, lower than long-term GDP growth, reflecting the mature nature of the mineral-based products industry.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Projected Net Income (CF) (in millions) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 10.0%)^n) | Net Present Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $200.8 | 0.9091 | $182.5 |
| **2027** | $214.8 | 0.8264 | $177.5 |
| **2028** | $225.9 | 0.7513 | $169.7 |
| **2029** | $235.1 | 0.6830 | $160.6 |
| **2030 (Excluding Terminal Value)** | $244.5 | 0.6209 | $151.8 |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
*   TV = FCFE (2030) $\times$ (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   TV = $244.5 \times (1 + 2.5\%) / (10.0\% - 2.5\%)$
*   TV = $250.61 / 0.075$
*   TV = **$3,341.4 million**

**Terminal Value Net Present Value:**
*   TV NPV = TV / (1 + 10.0%)^5
*   TV NPV = $3,341.4 \times 0.6209$
*   TV NPV = **$2,074.8 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows:**
*   Total NPV = (Sum of 2026-2030 NPV) + TV NPV
*   Total NPV = (\$182.5 + \$177.5 + \$169.7 + \$160.6 + \$151.8) + \$2,074.8
*   Total NPV = **\$842.1 + \$2,074.8 = \$2,916.9 million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated using the following formula:

**Fair Value of Equity** = Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $2,916.9 |
| **(+) Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $319.6$ |
| **(-) Total Debt** | $957.8$ |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$2,278.7 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 31.2 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$73.04** |

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Minerals Technologies Inc. (MTX) is **$73.04**.

The current market price is approximately **$73.00**. [cite: 3 (from step 1), 4 (from step 1), 5 (from step 1)]

**Conclusion:**
The calculated fair value of **$73.04** is essentially *identical* to the current market price of **$73.00**.

**Justification for Similarity with Market Value:**
The core assumptions made in this conservative valuation appear to closely mirror the market's collective expectations for MTX's future performance.

*   **Growth:** The market is likely pricing in the guided mid-single-digit growth for 2026 and a steady, conservative 4-5% growth rate thereafter, reflecting the company's dual exposure to stable consumer markets (cat litter, personal care) and cyclical but growing industrial/infrastructure markets.
*   **Margins:** The market has confidence in management's ability to execute on margin expansion, pricing in a Net Income Margin in the 8.3% - 8.5% range, consistent with the company's historical performance and the guided return to a $\sim$15% Operating Margin.
*   **Cost of Capital & Reinvestment:** The use of a 10.0% discount rate and a conservative 8.0% ROIC implies the market views MTX as a stable, mature industrial company with modest, but consistent, capital allocation returns. The market is giving no significant premium or discount for the current business model based on the balance of the conservative growth and margin projections.
*   **Debt/Cash:** The valuation uses a net debt position of $\sim$\$638.2 million, which the market seems comfortable with, given management's statement of a "robust balance sheet" and a low net leverage ratio of 1.6x adjusted EBITDA.

In summary, this valuation confirms that the market is currently pricing MTX as a stable, mature specialty materials company that is expected to execute on its publicly stated targets for moderate, mid-single-digit growth and modest margin expansion. There is no significant mispricing indicated under a conservative set of assumptions.
