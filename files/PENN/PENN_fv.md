### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

PENN's business is currently bifurcated into two main engines: the stable, cash-generating **Retail** casino business and the high-growth, high-cost **Interactive (ESPN BET)** segment striving for profitability.

#### **A. Business Engine Assumptions**

1.  **Retail Segment (Core Cash Flow):**
    *   **Basis:** The retail segment is a mature business with management reporting stability and modest growth of nearly 4% YoY in non-impacted markets. The company is completing four capital-intensive development projects by H1 2026.
    *   **Revenue Growth Assumption:** 3.0% YoY for 2026, dropping to a terminal growth rate of **2.0%** by 2030, reflecting maturity in the regional gaming market.
    *   **Net Income Margin:** Historical retail margins are robust. Management reported Q2 2025 Retail Adjusted EBITDAR margins of **33.8%**. I will use a conservative, long-term Retail Net Income Margin of **15.0%** to account for depreciation/amortization, interest (on traditional debt), and corporate overhead, which will be covered proportionally.

2.  **Interactive Segment (Growth Engine: ESPN BET):**
    *   **Basis:** The Interactive segment's entire valuation hinges on the successful launch and monetization of ESPN BET. Management guides for **positive EBITDA in Q4 2025** and **full-year Interactive profitability (positive EBITDA) in 2026**.
    *   **Engine:** The core driver is market share capture in Online Sports Betting (OSB) and iCasino, coupled with reduced promotional spending and leveraging the low-cost acquisition funnel of the ESPN ecosystem.
    *   **2025 Revenue Estimate:** The company's 2025 guidance midpoint for Interactive revenue is $1.5 billion. Given the Q2 2025 revenue of $316.1M (including tax gross up) and the Q4 profitability push, this seems reasonable. I will use the guidance of **$1,500 million** for 2025.
    *   **Growth Assumption (Post-Launch):** From 2026 to 2028, revenue is projected to grow aggressively at **25-15%** as ESPN BET scales and promotional spend is reduced. Post-2028, growth moderates to **5.0%** by 2030 as the market matures and a market-realistic share is achieved.
    *   **Net Income Margin:** The most challenging part. Given the current losses and the highly competitive market, profitability is a high-risk assumption. I will model a path to profitability as per management guidance:
        *   **2025:** High initial loss ($350 million YoY EBITDA improvement guided, but still a loss for Net Income).
        *   **2026:** First profitable year, modeling a Net Income Margin of **3.0%** as it achieves full-year positive EBITDA.
        *   **2030:** A conservative mature Net Income Margin of **8.0%** (lower than market leaders like DraftKings' long-term projections due to PENN's significant initial investment costs and ESPN partnership fees).

#### **B. Revenue and Net Income Projection Table (2025-2030)**

*All figures in millions USD*

| Year | Retail Revenue | Interactive Revenue | Total Revenue | Retail Net Income (15.0%) | Interactive Net Income (Margin %) | Total Projected Net Income (A) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | $5,675 | $1,500 | **$7,175** | $851.3 | ($300.0) (-20.0%) | **$551.3** |
| **2026 (P)** | $5,845 | $1,875 (+25.0%) | **$7,720** | $876.8 | $56.3 (+3.0%) | **$933.1** |
| **2027 (P)** | $6,020 | $2,156 (+15.0%) | **$8,176** | $903.0 | $129.4 (+6.0%) | **$1,032.4** |
| **2028 (P)** | $6,140 | $2,372 (+10.0%) | **$8,512** | $921.0 | $177.9 (+7.5%) | **$1,098.9** |
| **2029 (P)** | $6,263 | $2,480 (+4.5%) | **$8,743** | $939.5 | $193.4 (+7.8%) | **$1,132.9** |
| **2030 (P)** | $6,390 | $2,604 (+5.0%) | **$8,994** | $958.5 | $208.3 (+8.0%) | **$1,166.8** |

*Note: The **Total Projected Net Income (A)** already includes the Retail Net Income, which covers a substantial portion of the company's fixed and corporate costs.*

### **III. Cash Flow Model & Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**

#### **A. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

Since PENN has been largely unprofitable or marginally profitable due to high digital investments, a simple historical ROIC calculation would be negative or unreliable. As per the rules, since we are projecting profitability, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** **5.0%** (A low but positive figure, reflecting a maturing, asset-heavy gaming company with moderate new growth projects).

#### **B. Discount Rate & Maturity Rate**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%** (Reflects a high-risk profile for an entertainment company with significant digital growth uncertainty and high leverage).
*   **Conservative Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate:** **2.0%** (Reflects long-term GDP/inflation-tied growth for the combined mature casino/digital business).

#### **C. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow to Equity) & NPV Calculation**

The cash flow for DCF is modeled as the Net Income for the period.
**Net Income for Year N = Projected Net Income for Year N (A) + ROIC * Cash from Year N-1**

*All figures in millions USD*

| Year | Total Projected Net Income (A) | Cash In Hand from Prior Year (B) | ROIC Income (B * 5.0%) | Total Cash Flow (A + ROIC Income) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $551.3 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $551.3 | 0.909 | $501.1 |
| **2026** | $933.1 | $551.3 | $27.6 | $960.7 | 0.826 | $793.8 |
| **2027** | $1,032.4 | $1,512.0 | $75.6 | $1,108.0 | 0.751 | $832.1 |
| **2028** | $1,098.9 | $2,620.0 | $131.0 | $1,229.9 | 0.683 | $839.8 |
| **2029** | $1,132.9 | $3,849.9 | $192.5 | $1,325.4 | 0.621 | $823.1 |
| **2030** | $1,166.8 | $5,175.3 | $258.8 | $1,425.6 | 0.564 | $803.9 |
| **Total NPV of Projection Period (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **$4,593.8** |

*   *Note: Cash In Hand for Year N (B) = Total Cash Flow for Year N-1 + Cash In Hand for Year N-1. Cash In Hand for 2025 is assumed to be $0 for the ROIC calculation since the actual cash will be used to fund operations/Capex/buybacks.*

#### **D. Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the value of the expected cash flow beyond 2030, growing at the maturity rate.

*   **Perpetual Cash Flow (2031):** 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Growth Rate) = $1,425.6 million * (1 + 0.02) = $1,454.1 million
*   **Terminal Value at 2030:** Perpetual Cash Flow / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)
    *   $1,454.1 million / (0.10 - 0.02) = $18,176.3 million
*   **NPV of Terminal Value:** Terminal Value * Discount Factor for 2030
    *   $18,176.3 million * 0.564 = **$10,250.7 million**

#### **E. Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Projection Period (2025-2030) | $4,593.8 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $10,250.7 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$14,844.5** |

### **IV. Fair Value Calculation**

The Fair Value to Equity is calculated by adjusting the Enterprise Value for cash and debt.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $14,844.5 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $671.6 |
| Less: Total Debt (Comprehensive Estimate) | $11,200.0 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$4,316.1** |
| Divided by: Total Shares Outstanding | 150.0 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$28.77** |

### **V. Justification and Market Comparison**

**Fair Value Per Share:** **$28.77**

**Current Market Price (Assumed):** **~$18.00**

#### **A. Justification of Difference**

My calculated Fair Value of **$28.77** is significantly higher (approx. +60%) than the current assumed market price of $18.00. This large discrepancy is due to the market placing a heavy discount on the risk and uncertainty surrounding the company's two core, management-guided assumptions that underpin this valuation:

1.  **Skepticism on Interactive Profitability & Scale:**
    *   **My Assumption:** I assume management's guidance of Interactive Segment profitability by 2026 is met, and that ESPN BET can scale to a steady-state margin of 8.0% by 2030. The market is likely heavily discounting this. PENN is an unproven challenger in the U.S. digital market, facing entrenched leaders like DraftKings and FanDuel, and the market views the $1.5 billion in guided 2025 Interactive revenue as an extremely high-risk forecast. The market has priced PENN as a low-multiple regional casino business with a "call option" on digital that is being largely offset by digital losses.
2.  **Conservative Handling of Debt:**
    *   **My Assumption:** The model uses the most conservative, comprehensive debt figure of **$11.2 billion** (including REIT financing obligations) to deduct from the TEV, which already substantially reduces the equity value. A less conservative view (using only the $2.8 billion in "Traditional Total Debt") would result in a much higher Fair Value per Share, indicating that even with the conservative debt figure, the business is intrinsically undervalued based on its projected future cash flows.
3.  **High Discount Rate and Low ROIC:**
    *   **My Assumption:** I used a conservative 10.0% discount rate and a low 2.0% terminal growth rate, and a conservative 5.0% ROIC. If the market were to adopt a more optimistic view of their growth trajectory (e.g., a lower discount rate for a successful tech platform) the value would be significantly higher. The market is pricing in a high probability of failure for the Interactive segment to meet its margin targets.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The market is pricing PENN based on the extreme execution risk in the Interactive division and the substantial non-traditional debt. My valuation suggests that **if** PENN's management is successful in achieving its stated goal of full-year Interactive profitability by 2026 and can maintain the retail segment's steady 15% Net Income margin, the stock is currently **significantly undervalued**. The $10.77 difference between the market price and the calculated fair value represents the **market's risk premium for the failure of the ESPN BET platform to achieve sustained, substantial profitability.**
