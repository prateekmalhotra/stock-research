Deliveroo plc (DROOF) Stock Valuation

## I. Financial Base & Assumptions (All figures in $\text{£}$ millions unless otherwise noted)

The valuation will be conducted in $\text{GBP}$ ($\text{£}$) as Deliveroo reports its financials in this currency, and the final per-share value will be converted to $\text{USD}$ ($\text{\$}$), which is the currency for the DROOF ticker. All figures used are based on the latest available public information, including the FY 2024 Annual Report and H1 2025 trading updates.

### A. Core Financial Data (Latest Available)

| Metric | Value ($\text{£}$ million) | Source Date/Year | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | 667.9 | December 31, 2024 | Sum of Cash & Cash Equivalents ($\text{£461.3m}$) and Other Treasury Deposits ($\text{£206.6m}$), as liquid assets in hand. |
| **Total Debt** | 0.0 | December 31, 2024 | The company reported no debt outstanding at year-end 2024. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 1,474 million | June 30, 2025 | Represents the most recent outstanding share count after buybacks, used for a conservative per-share calculation. |
| **Net Income (Statutory)** | 3.0 | FY 2024 | The first year of statutory profit. |
| **Revenue** | 2,071.9 | FY 2024 | Base revenue for projections. |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | 130.0 | FY 2024 | Used to derive margin structure. |

### B. Business Engine Analysis & Projections

Deliveroo's core business engine is a three-sided marketplace connecting consumers, riders, and merchants, driven primarily by **Gross Transaction Value (GTV)**. GTV growth is generated by increasing the number of active consumers, improving their order frequency (AOF), and expanding new verticals like Grocery and Retail.

**Management Guidance & Assumptions:**
1.  **2025 GTV Growth:** Top end of high single digits, which we will conservatively model as $\mathbf{9.0\%}$ constant currency GTV growth.
2.  **Medium-Term GTV Growth (2026+):** Mid-teens percentage GTV growth per annum, which we will model as $\mathbf{15.0\%}$ in the initial high-growth years.
3.  **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth lagged GTV growth in 2024. To be conservative, we assume the take-rate remains relatively flat, and thus Revenue growth is slightly below GTV growth.
4.  **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Management is targeting $\mathbf{4\%+}$ of GTV from 2026. This will be used to guide the Net Income projection.

### C. Projection of Revenue (2025-2030)

Since the GTV for 2024 is not explicitly provided in $\text{£}$ millions but GTV growth and Revenue are, we will project Revenue directly based on GTV growth guidance, applying a small downward adjustment for conservatism.

| Year | Revenue (previous $\text{£}m$) | GTV Growth Assumption | Revenue Growth Assumption | Projected Revenue ($\text{£}m$) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | N/A | N/A | N/A | 2,071.9 | FY 2024 Reported Revenue |
| **2025** | 2,071.9 | 9.0% | 8.0% | 2,237.6 | Conservative estimate based on "top end of high single digits" GTV guidance. |
| **2026** | 2,237.6 | 15.0% | 12.5% | 2,517.3 | Conservative Revenue growth below "mid-teens" GTV target from 2026. |
| **2027** | 2,517.3 | 15.0% | 12.0% | 2,819.4 | Sustained strong growth as "Plus-first" business strategy matures and new verticals scale. |
| **2028** | 2,819.4 | 14.0% | 11.0% | 3,129.5 | Growth moderates slightly due to market saturation and competition. |
| **2029** | 3,129.5 | 13.0% | 10.0% | 3,442.5 | Growth continues to normalize. |
| **2030** | 3,442.5 | 12.0% | 8.0% | 3,717.9 | Long-term growth settles in the high single digits. |

### D. Projection of Net Income (2025-2030)

**Margin Assumptions:**
*   **Net Income Margin (Base):** The statutory Net Income margin in 2024 was very low ($\text{£3.0m} / \text{£2,071.9m} = 0.14\%$).
*   **Net Income Margin (Target):** We will use a conservative Net Income margin that slowly ramps toward a reasonable long-term margin for a scale business, well below the target of $4\%+$ Adjusted EBITDA margin to account for non-cash expenses like share-based payments (which are a large difference between Adj. EBITDA and Net Income) and D&A. We will target a **$\mathbf{2.0\%}$ Net Income margin** by 2030.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Deliveroo's past ROIC is not explicitly stated in the results, but the company is newly profitable. Since Net Income is positive, we will use a conservative but reasonable ROIC of $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ on the prior year's accumulated cash (as per the rule).

| Year | Projected Revenue ($\text{£}m$) | Net Income Margin ($\%$) | Net Income from Operations ($\text{£}m$) | Prior Year Cash Added ($\text{£}m$) | ROIC ($\mathbf{5.0\%}$) ($\text{£}m$) | Total Net Income ($\text{£}m$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 2,071.9 | 0.14% | 3.0 | N/A | N/A | 3.0 |
| **2025** | 2,237.6 | 0.70% | 15.7 | 3.0 | 0.2 | **15.9** |
| **2026** | 2,517.3 | 1.00% | 25.2 | 15.9 | 0.8 | **26.0** |
| **2027** | 2,819.4 | 1.30% | 36.7 | 26.0 | 1.3 | **38.0** |
| **2028** | 3,129.5 | 1.60% | 50.1 | 38.0 | 1.9 | **52.0** |
| **2029** | 3,442.5 | 1.80% | 61.9 | 52.0 | 2.6 | **64.5** |
| **2030** | 3,717.9 | 2.00% | 74.4 | 64.5 | 3.2 | **77.6** |

## II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a conservative, yet reasonable, discount rate of $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ to reflect the company's relatively high-growth, competitive market, and a small-cap public stock risk (even if the company carries no debt).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative, long-term nominal growth rate of $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ is used, which is close to long-term inflation or mature economy GDP growth.

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Income from each year is assumed to go straight into cash (free cash flow to equity) for the valuation.

| Year | Projected Net Income ($\text{£}m$) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value ($\text{£}m$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 15.9 | 0.909 | 14.5 |
| **2026** | 26.0 | 0.826 | 21.5 |
| **2027** | 38.0 | 0.751 | 28.5 |
| **2028** | 52.0 | 0.683 | 35.5 |
| **2029** | 64.5 | 0.621 | 40.0 |
| **2030** | 77.6 | 0.564 | 43.8 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** | **183.8** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value is calculated as the Perpetuity Growth Model starting in the year 2031:

*   **2031 Cash Flow Projection:** $\text{£77.6 million} \times (1 + 2.0\%) = \text{£79.2 million}$
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** $\text{79.2} / (\text{10.0\%} - \text{2.0\%}) = \text{£990.0 million}$
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (2030):** $\text{£990.0 million} \times \text{0.564}$ (2030 Discount Factor) = $\text{£557.7 million}$

### D. Total Equity Value

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** NPV of Projected CFs + NPV of Terminal Value
    $$\text{TEV} = \text{£183.8m} + \text{£557.7m} = \text{£741.5 million}$$
*   **Equity Value:** TEV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
    $$\text{Equity Value} = \text{£741.5m} + \text{£667.9m} - \text{£0.0m} = \text{£1,409.4 million}$$

## III. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value Per Share

*   **Equity Value:** $\text{£1,409.4 million}$
*   **Shares Outstanding:** $1,474$ million
*   **Fair Value Per Share ($\text{£}$):** $\text{£1,409.4m} / \text{1,474m} = \text{£0.956}$ per share.

Assuming a representative exchange rate of $\text{£}1 = \text{\$1.22}$ (for DROOF):

*   **Fair Value Per Share (USD):** $\text{£0.956} \times \text{\$1.22}/\text{£} = \mathbf{\$1.166}$

### B. Comparison and Justification

*   **Fair Value (DCF):** $\mathbf{\$1.166}$ per share
*   **Current Market Value (Approximate):** $\mathbf{\$2.44}$ per share (Assumed market value based on search results for DROOF in late 2025).

Our calculated fair value ($\text{\$1.166}$) is significantly lower than the current market value ($\text{\$2.44}$).

**Justification for the Discrepancy:**

The main reason for the large difference is the highly material, public, and contradictory information about Deliveroo's status:

1.  **Market Assumption (Acquisition Premium):** The market value of $\text{\$2.44}$ (equivalent to $\text{£1.996}$ per share) aligns very closely with the proposed acquisition price by DoorDash, which was $\text{£2.9 billion}$ for the equity, translating to approximately $\text{£1.97}$ per share based on the $1.474$ billion share count. **The market is clearly pricing in the almost-certain acquisition by DoorDash, placing a premium on the stock equivalent to the expected takeout price, not the intrinsic value of the company's standalone operations.**
2.  **Conservative DCF Model:** Our model is intentionally conservative, as requested:
    *   **Revenue Growth:** We assumed an $8.0\%$ revenue growth in 2025, which is lower than the $9.0\%$ GTV guidance, and a long-term maturity rate of only $2.0\%$, which is very low for a growth company. The market likely assumes a higher, sustained growth rate and a significantly larger terminal value.
    *   **Profitability Margin:** Our target Net Income margin of $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ by 2030 is extremely conservative. If the market were to assume a higher, more optimistic long-term Net Income margin of $3.5\%$ on the projected 2030 revenue, the DCF would yield an equity value of $\text{£2.28 billion}$, or $\text{£1.55}$ per share ($\text{\$1.89}$ per share), which is still below the current market price but much closer. The market likely believes Deliveroo can convert its $4\%+$ Adjusted EBITDA target into a higher Net Income margin than our conservative estimate.
    *   **Discount Rate:** A $10.0\%$ discount rate is conservative. Growth investors in this sector often use a lower WACC, which would significantly increase the NPV.

**Conclusion:**

The market is not valuing Deliveroo based on its standalone discounted cash flows. The current market price for DROOF reflects the **acquisition price offered by DoorDash** (approximately $\text{\$2.41}$ - $\text{\$2.44}$ per share), which is a common scenario when a merger or acquisition is publicly announced and expected to close. Our intrinsic value of **$\text{\$1.166}$** represents the highly conservative, fundamental value of the company's future cash flows as an independent entity, which suggests that without the takeover, the stock would be significantly overvalued at its current price.
