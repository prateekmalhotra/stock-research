| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | £461.3 million | Balance Sheet, FY 2024 |
| **Total Debt** | £40.5 million | Estimated from summary data, considered conservative for a strong net cash position company. [cite: 2 in Step 3] |

### **B. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The business engine for Deliveroo is primarily driven by **Gross Transaction Value (GTV)** and the **Take Rate**. The management explicitly guides on GTV growth and profitability based on GTV.

#### **1. GTV Growth (Revenue Driver)**

Management guidance is the foundation for these conservative estimates:
*   **2025:** Management is guiding for **high-single digit GTV growth** (ex-Hong Kong). **Assumption: 8.0%** (Conservative side of "high-single digit"). [cite: 6 in Step 3]
*   **2026 - 2030 (Medium Term):** Management is targeting **mid-teens percentage growth per annum** in constant currency. **Assumption: 14.0%** (Conservative side of "mid-teens," and assumes no acceleration after 2026).

#### **2. Take Rate (Revenue Margin)**

*   The 2024 Take Rate is 28.0%.
*   Management has noted that while advertising revenue is a tailwind (expected to progress towards 2%+ of GTV by 2026), investments into the Consumer Value Proposition (CVP) like fee and price optimization are a headwind.
*   **Conservative Assumption:** I will assume a constant Take Rate of **28.0%** from 2025-2030. This conservatively discounts the full benefit of advertising revenue scale while factoring in continued competitive price pressure/CVP investments.

***
### **C. Margin Projections & ROIC (2025 - 2030)**

#### **1. Net Income Margin (Profit Driver)**

*   **Management Guidance:** The target is an **Adjusted EBITDA margin of 4%+ of GTV** in the medium term, with margin improvement accelerating from 2026. [cite: 1 in Step 2]
*   **Translating EBITDA/GTV to Net Income/Revenue (Conservative):**
    *   4.0% EBITDA/GTV (target) * 7.4/2.072 (GTV/Revenue multiplier, or inverse of Take Rate) = ~14.3% EBITDA/Revenue.
    *   To be **conservative**, I will project the Net Income Margin (post-tax, post-depreciation/amortization) to only reach **2.5% of Revenue** by 2030. This significantly understates the implied profitability of the 4%+ Adj. EBITDA/GTV target, which aligns with the "conservative in this business engine building" rule.

| Year | GTV Growth % | Revenue Growth % | Take Rate % | Net Income Margin % of Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 8.0% | 8.0% | 28.0% | 0.5% (Ramp-up from 0.14%) |
| **2026** | 14.0% | 14.0% | 28.0% | 1.0% |
| **2027** | 14.0% | 14.0% | 28.0% | 1.5% |
| **2028** | 14.0% | 14.0% | 28.0% | 2.0% |
| **2029** | 14.0% | 14.0% | 28.0% | 2.5% |
| **2030** | 14.0% | 14.0% | 28.0% | 2.5% |

#### **2. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**

*   **Historical Data:** Trailing 12-month ROIC is 2.87%. [cite: 2 in Step 3]
*   **Assumption:** Since the company is newly profitable and the goal is a conservative valuation, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC of **3.0%** on the retained cash from the prior year's Net Income.

## **II. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Projections**

The DCF model uses the projected Net Income as the cash flow for each year.

### **A. Net Income (Cash Flow) Projection (Millions GBP)**

The Net Income for the next year is calculated as: $NI_{t} = (Revenue_{t} \times NI\ Margin_{t}) + (NI_{t-1} \times ROIC)$

| Year | GTV (Millions £) | Revenue (Millions £) | Net Income (Millions £) | ROIC Add'l Income (Millions £) | Total NI/Cash Flow (Millions £) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | 7,400.0 | 2,072.0 | 3.0 | N/A | 3.0 |
| **2025** | 7,992.0 | 2,237.9 | 11.2 | 0.1 (3.0 * 3.0%) | **11.3** |
| **2026** | 9,110.9 | 2,551.2 | 25.5 | 0.3 (11.3 * 3.0%) | **25.8** |
| **2027** | 10,386.4 | 2,908.4 | 43.6 | 0.8 (25.8 * 3.0%) | **44.4** |
| **2028** | 11,840.5 | 3,315.6 | 66.3 | 1.3 (44.4 * 3.0%) | **67.6** |
| **2029** | 13,498.2 | 3,780.0 | 94.5 | 2.0 (67.6 * 3.0%) | **96.5** |
| **2030** | 15,387.9 | 4,310.4 | 107.8 | 2.9 (96.5 * 3.0%) | **110.7** |

### **B. Discount Rate & Terminal Value**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** I will use a **10.0%** discount rate, which is a standard conservative rate that reflects the company's operating stability, newly established profitability, and moderate growth potential (relative to a high-growth unprofitable tech company).
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Perpetuity Growth Rate):** I will assume a conservative terminal growth rate of **2.0%** in perpetuity, representing long-term GDP and inflation-aligned growth.

#### **1. Terminal Value (TV)**

*   TV = [Cash Flow (2030) x (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = [£110.7M x (1 + 0.02)] / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = £113.0M / 0.08 = **£1,412.5 million**

#### **2. Net Present Value (NPV)**

The NPV is calculated by discounting the projected cash flows (Net Income) and the Terminal Value back to 2025.

| Year | Cash Flow (Millions £) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (Millions £) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 11.3 | 0.909 | 10.3 |
| **2026** | 25.8 | 0.826 | 21.3 |
| **2027** | 44.4 | 0.751 | 33.3 |
| **2028** | 67.6 | 0.683 | 46.1 |
| **2029** | 96.5 | 0.621 | 60.0 |
| **2030** | 110.7 | 0.564 | 62.4 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | 1,412.5 | 0.564 | 796.6 |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **£1,030.0 million** |

***
## **III. Fair Value Calculation**

I will use an exchange rate of **1.25 USD/GBP** for the final conversion.

| Metric | Value (Millions £) | Value (Millions \$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Future Cash Flows | £1,030.0 | \$1,287.5 |
| (+) Total Current Cash & Equivalents | £461.3 | \$576.6 |
| (-) Total Debt | £40.5 | \$50.6 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **£1,450.8** | **\$1,813.5** |

### **Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

*   **Fair Value per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value per Share = \$1,813.5 million / 1,500 million shares
*   **Fair Value per Share = \$1.21**

## **IV. Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DROOF)** | **\$1.21** |
| **Current Stock Price (DROOF)** | **\$2.44** [cite: 2 in Step 1] |
| **Difference** | **-50.4%** |

### **Valuation Justification**

The calculated fair value of **\$1.21** per share is approximately **50.4% lower** than the current market price of **\$2.44**.

**Justification for the Difference (Why the Market is Different):**

The market is making a significantly more optimistic assumption about the company's long-term growth and margin profile than this conservative DCF model.

1.  **Market Assumption on Growth and Take Rate:** My model conservatively projects a 14.0% GTV growth rate and a stable 28.0% Take Rate. The market is likely pricing in a future where Deliveroo can achieve a sustained, higher-teens or even 20%+ GTV growth for a longer period, while also successfully implementing significant Take Rate expansion through a successful advertising platform and reduced consumer incentives. The mid-teens GTV guidance is likely seen as an *underpromise* that the company will *overdeliver* on.

2.  **Market Assumption on Profitability (Margin Leverage):** My model assumes a very conservative long-term Net Income Margin of only **2.5% of Revenue**. To justify the current stock price, the market is likely factoring in the full realization of management's **4%+ Adjusted EBITDA/GTV** target, which would imply an EBITDA margin of around 14-15% of revenue. If we assume a Net Income Margin of 5.0% by 2030 (double the model's conservative assumption), the calculated fair value would be significantly higher. The market believes operating leverage will continue to dramatically improve profitability post-2026.

3.  **Terminal Value/Discount Rate:** The market is likely using a lower discount rate (reflecting a lower-risk profile due to confirmed profitability) and a higher terminal growth rate (3.0%+), which significantly increases the Net Present Value of the terminal cash flows.

**The conservative nature of this valuation is the primary reason for the large difference.** This valuation is a **"worst-case reasonable scenario"** based on the conservative interpretation of management's guidance (mid-teens growth is not acceleration, 4%+ EBITDA/GTV is not fully translated to Net Income, and a stable 28.0% Take Rate). The market, by contrast, is pricing in a **successful execution scenario** where growth re-accelerates, the take rate expands, and the company achieves significant operating leverage, driving the Net Income Margin towards the higher end of its peer group.
