### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Forecast**

Puig is a premium beauty product maker, with **Fragrance and Fashion** (73% of H1 2025 net revenue) being the core driver, supplemented by **Skincare** and **Makeup**. The business engine is driven by:
1.  **Premiumization:** Scaling niche brands (e.g., Byredo, Charlotte Tilbury) to higher volumes while maintaining premium pricing and high margins.
2.  **Geographic Expansion:** Double-digit LFL growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions is noted in H1 2025.
3.  **Core Brand Strength:** Continued solid performance from flagship brands (Rabanne, Carolina Herrera).

#### **Revenue Assumptions (M€)**

The forecast is based on the management guidance and a conservative long-term growth profile:

*   **2025:** Management reaffirmed a **6-8% like-for-like (LFL) Net Revenue growth**, expecting to land at the lower end. We use **+6.0%** growth on FY 2024 Revenue of €4,790M.
*   **2026-2027:** Due to the premium beauty market outperformance and brand scaling, a growth rate of **+5.0%** is assumed, slightly above a conservative long-term market growth rate.
*   **2028-2030:** The growth rate is conservatively tapered down to **+4.0%** and then **+3.0%** to reflect market maturation and a cautious approach as per the valuation rules.

| Year | Revenue (M€) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | €4,790.0 | - | Company Reported Revenue |
| **2025 (Projection)** | €5,077.4 | +6.0% | Conservative end of 6-8% management guidance. |
| **2026 (Projection)** | €5,331.3 | +5.0% | Continued premiumization and market outperformance. |
| **2027 (Projection)** | €5,597.9 | +5.0% | Continued momentum, moderating slightly. |
| **2028 (Projection)** | €5,821.8 | +4.0% | Further moderation, in line with long-term industry growth. |
| **2029 (Projection)** | €5,996.5 | +3.0% | Conservative long-term premium growth assumption. |
| **2030 (Projection)** | €6,176.4 | +3.0% | Stable mature growth rate. |

### **III. Net Income and ROIC Projection**

#### **Margin Assumptions**

*   **Gross Margin:** H1 2025 Gross Margin was a very high **75.8%**, one of the highest in the industry. This high margin is maintained across the projection period, reflecting the premium, high-value nature of the luxury fragrance and beauty segments.
*   **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Management guided for a 20 basis points improvement in 2025. H1 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4%. We use a **Net Income Margin** that grows moderately, reflecting operational leverage and margin improvement from the premium portfolio.

**Historical Net Income (FY 2024):**
Based on previous search context, reported Net Income for FY 2024 was approx. €530M on €4,790M Revenue.
*   *FY 2024 Net Income Margin:* 530 / 4,790 = **11.06%**

**Net Income Projection:**
We start with a conservative **11.50%** Net Income margin in 2025, gradually increasing by 20 basis points annually to reflect management's guidance on margin improvement (EBITDA margin up 20 bps) due to scale, which should flow down to the net income line.

| Year | Revenue (M€) | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income (M€) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | €5,077.4 | 11.50% | €583.9 |
| **2026** | €5,331.3 | 11.70% | €623.7 |
| **2027** | €5,597.9 | 11.90% | €666.1 |
| **2028** | €5,821.8 | 12.10% | €704.4 |
| **2029** | €5,996.5 | 12.30% | €737.6 |
| **2030** | €6,176.4 | 12.50% | €772.1 |

#### **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

The rule states: Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year (based on margin assumptions) + ROIC from net income got from previous year.

**Historical ROIC Calculation (Approximate FY 2024):**
*   **Invested Capital (IC) FY 2024:** Total Debt (€1,657.10M) + Total Equity (€3,537.68M) = €5,194.78M
*   **NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) FY 2024:** Assuming an average tax rate of 25% on 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €930M (based on H1 2025 margin guidance), NOPAT is complex to precisely calculate without the full Income Statement.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** Given the company's strong brand portfolio (high intangible assets, which inflate the IC denominator) and high gross margins, a conservative, yet positive ROIC is necessary. I will assume a conservative **ROIC of 6.0%**, which is a reasonable return for a stable, premium, non-capital-intensive business in a mature market, and is below the firm's approximate cost of capital.

**Adjusted Net Income (M€):**

| Year | Net Income (M€) | ROIC on Previous Year's Net Income (6.0%) | Adjusted Net Income (Cash Flow) (M€) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | €583.9 | - | **€583.9** |
| **2026** | €623.7 | €35.0 (583.9 \* 6.0%) | **€658.7** |
| **2027** | €666.1 | €37.4 (623.7 \* 6.0%) | **€703.5** |
| **2028** | €704.4 | €40.0 (666.1 \* 6.0%) | **€744.4** |
| **2029** | €737.6 | €42.3 (704.4 \* 6.0%) | **€779.9** |
| **2030** | €772.1 | €44.3 (737.6 \* 6.0%) | **€816.4** |

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The Adjusted Net Income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

#### **Valuation Parameters**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **2.0%** (Assumes long-term growth slightly above historical inflation for a mature, premium business).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** **8.0%** (A reasonable cost of equity for a stable luxury/consumer-defensive company, reflecting conservative assumptions).

#### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Year (t) | Adjusted Net Income (M€) | Discount Factor (1/1.08^t) | NPV of Cash Flow (M€) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | €583.9 | 0.9259 | €540.6 |
| **2026** | €658.7 | 0.8573 | €564.6 |
| **2027** | €703.5 | 0.7938 | €558.3 |
| **2028** | €744.4 | 0.7350 | €547.2 |
| **2029** | €779.9 | 0.6806 | €530.8 |
| **2030** | €816.4 | 0.6302 | €514.5 |
| **Total NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **€3,256.0** |

#### **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   **FCFE in 2031 (Estimate):** €816.4M \* (1 + 2.0%) = €832.7M
*   **TV Formula:** FCFE (2031) / (r - g)
*   **TV:** €832.7M / (8.0% - 2.0%) = €832.7M / 0.06 = €13,878.3M
*   **NPV of TV (Discounted back to T=0):** TV \* Discount Factor (2030)
*   **NPV of TV:** €13,878.3M \* 0.6302 = **€8,746.5M**

**Total Equity Value (TEV):** NPV of Explicit Period + NPV of Terminal Value
**TEV:** €3,256.0M + €8,746.5M = **€12,002.5 million**

### **V. Fair Value Calculation**

Fair Value is calculated using the Adjusted Net Income (FCFE) as the cash flow metric, meaning the debt/cash adjustment is not necessary if the discount rate is the Cost of Equity. However, following the instruction: *Fair Value = (TEV + Cash - Debt) / Shares Outstanding* using the unlevered cash flow (FCFF) method with WACC is the standard, while using FCFE/Cost of Equity already captures the debt effect in the cash flow itself.

To adhere strictly to the rule: *subtracting debt and dividing by shares* while using the FCFE-derived Total Equity Value, we will use the FCFE method, which yields the Equity Value directly, and then slightly adjust for the cash and debt to meet the prompt's explicit final formula step.

| Item | Value (M€) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (from DCF)** | €12,002.5 |
| **(+) Total Cash & Equivalents** | €283.32 |
| **(-) Total Debt** | €1,429.96 |
| **Final Adjusted Equity Value** | **€10,855.9** |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | 563.30 million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **€19.27** |

## **Final Valuation Summary**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (EUR)** | **€19.27** |
| **Current Stock Price (PUIG, EUR)** | **€13.78** |
| **Valuation Upside** | **+39.84%** |

### **Justification and Market Assumption Analysis**

The calculated fair value of **€19.27** is significantly higher than the current market price of **€13.78**, suggesting the stock is undervalued based on the conservative growth and margin assumptions.

**Justification for Disparity (Why is my assumption different from the market?):**

1.  **Market Skepticism on Growth Longevity:** The market may not fully believe the long-term growth embedded in my model.
    *   **My Assumption:** The model assumes an average 4.2% revenue growth (2025-2030) and a conservative terminal growth of 2.0%. This is backed by the company's outperformance of the premium beauty market and its successful M&A strategy (Charlotte Tilbury, Byredo).
    *   **Market's Possible Assumption:** The market may be discounting the growth rate more aggressively, perhaps due to the heavy reliance on the Fragrance and Fashion segment, which is prone to changing consumer tastes, or due to a highly competitive environment from peers like L'Oréal and Estée Lauder. The recent slowdown in fragrance growth in H2 2025 noted in the earnings reports may be weighing on investor sentiment.
2.  **Higher Discount Rate / Risk Perception:** The market may perceive the company as riskier than the 8.0% discount rate implies.
    *   **My Assumption:** 8.0% is a stable, conservative rate for a luxury brand with high margins.
    *   **Market's Possible Assumption:** Given the company's recent IPO (May 2024), its relatively short public history, dual-class share structure (family retains 93% of voting rights), and exposure to FX risk and supply chain volatility (global luxury goods), the market might be applying a higher **Cost of Equity (r)**, perhaps 9.0% or 10.0%, which would significantly lower the DCF value.
3.  **Lower ROIC Expectation:** The market may project a lower future ROIC, diminishing the compounding effect of the business.
    *   **My Assumption:** A 6.0% ROIC is conservative but reflects the inherent high profitability of premium brands.
    *   **Market's Possible Assumption:** The high level of intangible assets (Goodwill and Brands, >€4.6B in H1 2025) suggests significant acquisition activity and potentially lower capital efficiency on a larger base, leading the market to factor in a lower ROIC, reducing the cash flow contribution from retained earnings.

**Conclusion on Valuation:**
The valuation model suggests the market is under-appreciating Puig Brands' ability to maintain its high-margin profile and execute on its strategy of scaling acquired premium brands in high-growth regions like the Americas and Asia-Pacific. The fair value of **€19.27** is justified by the strong gross margins (75.8%) and management's proven track record of outperforming the premium beauty market, which the market's current price of €13.78 does not fully reflect. A 10% discount rate, for example, would yield a fair value of approximately €13.88, which suggests the market is pricing the stock with a more aggressive risk premium ($\sim$10%) than my conservative estimate ($\sim$8.0%).
