## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

### Justification for Revenue Projections

Puig's business engine is driven by its strong portfolio of premium and luxury brands, with a core focus on **Fragrance & Fashion (73% of FY 2024 Net Revenue)**, supplemented by high-growth segments in **Skincare and Makeup**.

*   **Core Growth Drivers:**
    *   **Fragrance & Fashion:** Continued success of core franchises like *Carolina Herrera Good Girl* (#1 feminine fragrance worldwide in 2024) and *Jean Paul Gaultier* (entering the top 10). Growth is also supported by the double-digit performance of Niche brands (e.g., Penhaligon's, Byredo).
    *   **Skincare:** High-growth category (up 19.8% reported in FY 2024), led by the strong performance of Uriage and *Charlotte Tilbury Skincare*.
    *   **Makeup:** Showing signs of recovery, with Q3 2025 delivering strong like-for-like growth (+18.8%) after challenges in early 2024. This turnaround is driven by sustained success at *Charlotte Tilbury* and new retail strategies (e.g., strategic pipelining into Amazon in the U.S.).

*   **Management Guidance (2025):** Management has reaffirmed its full-year 2025 outlook for **6%-8% like-for-like net revenue growth**, expecting to land in the **middle of the range** (i.e., **7.0%**).

| Year | Revenue Growth Assumption | Projected Net Revenue (€ millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | *N/A (Base Year)* | 4,790.0 | FY 2024 Reported Revenue. |
| **FY 2025** | 7.0% | 5,125.3 | Use of management's guidance to land in the middle of the 6-8% LFL growth range. |
| **FY 2026** | 6.0% | 5,432.8 | Conservative step-down, reflecting continued outperformance but gradual moderation as the base grows. |
| **FY 2027** | 5.0% | 5,704.4 | Still benefiting from Skincare and Niche expansion, but closer to long-term luxury market growth. |
| **FY 2028** | 4.0% | 5,932.6 | Reflecting increased market maturity and competition. |
| **FY 2029** | 3.0% | 6,110.6 | Conservative growth for a globally diversified, premium conglomerate. |
| **FY 2030** | 2.5% | 6,263.4 | Approaching a conservative terminal growth rate for a mature beauty business. |

## 3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow Projections

### Margin and ROIC Assumptions

*   **Net Income Margin:** The adjusted net profit margin for FY 2024 was **11.5%**. Management is guiding for adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in 2025, in line with 2024. To be conservative yet acknowledge the premium pricing power and operational leverage of the luxury beauty sector, a stable projected Net Income Margin of **12.0%** is used for all years.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Based on the strong, positive profitability of the company, and noting the rule to select a reasonable positive ROIC, a conservative ROIC of **6.5%** is assumed for re-investing the prior year's cash generated from Net Income.
    *   *Calculation logic for additional income:* Net Income ($t$) = (Projected Net Income from Revenue * Margin) + (Cash from Previous Year's Net Income * ROIC).
    *   *Base Net Income for ROIC 2024:* Net Profit (Adjusted) for FY 2024 was €551M.

### DCF Calculation Table

| Metric/Year (€ millions) | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | FY 2028 | FY 2029 | FY 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Net Revenue** | 5,125.3 | 5,432.8 | 5,704.4 | 5,932.6 | 6,110.6 | 6,263.4 |
| **B. Projected Net Income (A * 12.0%)** | 615.0 | 651.9 | 684.5 | 711.9 | 733.3 | 751.6 |
| **C. Previous NI Carried to Cash (Year $t-1$)** | 551.0 (FY 2024) | 651.1 | 693.3 | 738.1 | 785.6 | 835.8 |
| **D. ROIC Income (C * 6.5%)** | 35.8 | 42.3 | 45.1 | 47.9 | 51.1 | 54.3 |
| **E. Total Projected Cash Flow (B + D)** | **650.8** | **694.2** | **729.6** | **759.8** | **784.4** | **805.9** |
| **F. Discount Factor (12.0%)** | 0.893 | 0.797 | 0.712 | 0.636 | 0.568 | 0.507 |
| **G. Discounted Cash Flow (E * F)** | **581.0** | **553.4** | **519.5** | **483.2** | **445.5** | **409.0** |

*Note: The actual cash from the previous year's Net Income (C) includes the full Net Income from that year plus the ROIC income carried over.*

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate:** A conservative but reasonable rate of **12.0%** is chosen. This is higher than the assumed market risk-free rate plus a standard equity premium for a luxury goods company, reflecting the recent IPO, its dual share class structure, and the inherent volatility in the fashion/beauty industry.
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** A very conservative **2.0%** is used. This is a conservative estimate, lower than the long-term global premium beauty market growth rate, ensuring the terminal value does not overly inflate the valuation.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (end of 2030):**
$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Projected Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{€}805.9 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.12 - 0.02} = \frac{\text{€}822.018 \text{M}}{0.10} = \text{€}8,220.18 \text{M}$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value:**
$$\text{NPV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$

$$\text{NPV of TV} = \text{€}8,220.18 \text{M} \times 0.507 = \text{€}4,166.43 \text{M}$$

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value:**
| Metric | Value (€ millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | **€3,091.6M** (€581.0 + €553.4 + €519.5 + €483.2 + €445.5 + €409.0) |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | **€4,166.43M** |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **€7,258.03M** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents (FY 2024)** | **€884.44M** |
| **Subtract: Total Debt (FY 2024)** | **€1,950.34M** |
| **Total Equity Value** | **€6,192.13M** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{€}6,192.13 \text{M}}{563,300,359 \text{ shares}} = \text{€}10.99$$

## 5. Justification and Conclusion

### Final Valuation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (EUR)** | **€10.99** |
| **Current Stock Price (EUR)** | **€13.94** |
| **Difference** | **-21.16%** |

### Market vs. Fair Value Justification

The calculated Fair Value of **€10.99** is significantly lower than the current market price of **€13.94**, indicating the stock is **overvalued** by the market based on these conservative assumptions.

The market is making a case for a higher valuation by making one or more assumptions that are more aggressive than the conservative DCF model:

1.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate (Less Conservative Business Engine):** The market is likely pricing in a higher revenue growth rate post-2025, perhaps closer to 6-8% for longer. Puig has a history of outperforming its own targets (doubled sales in two years instead of three, meeting 2025 sales target in 2023), and a higher growth rate is justified by a sustained boom in the premium beauty sector, especially in Skincare and niche brands. If the growth rate only decelerated to 4% by 2030, the fair value would be closer to the market price.
2.  **Higher Margin Profile (Operational Leverage):** The market expects continued improvement in margins beyond the 12.0% assumed. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 20 basis points in FY 2024. The market may expect Net Income Margin to climb to 13.0% - 14.0% by 2030, reflecting successful brand acquisitions reaching scale and realizing greater economies of scale in distribution.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate (Lower Perceived Risk):** The market may be using a lower cost of equity, perhaps 10.0% or 10.5%, reflecting the stability and "luxury moat" of the company's brands and its strong financial health (Net Debt/Adj. EBITDA of 1.1x).

The **justification for the discrepancy** is that my valuation is intentionally conservative, as per the rules: a conservative discount rate (12.0%), a very conservative maturity rate (2.0%), and a rapid deceleration in growth rate. The market is extrapolating Puig's historical outperformance and strong premium brand portfolio to generate a higher, sustained growth profile, which is a key assumption an investor must justify when paying the current price.
