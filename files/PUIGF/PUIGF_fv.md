### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Puig Brands S.A. is a premium beauty company whose primary business drivers are **brand strength and premium market outperformance**, **product innovation**, and **geographic expansion**, particularly in the high-growth APAC and Americas regions. The core segments are Fragrance and Fashion (73% of 2024 revenue), Makeup (Charlotte Tilbury), and Skincare (Uriage, Dr. Barbara Sturm).

The revenue model is built on conservative assumptions:

1.  **2025 Revenue:** Management has guided for a Like-for-Like (LFL) revenue growth of **6% to 8%**, expecting to land in the **middle of the range** (i.e., **7.0%**). I will use a conservative **6.5% LFL growth** to account for potential economic headwinds and currency volatility (which has been a headwind).
    *   *Assumption: Given LFL growth was 10.9% in 2024, 6.5% is a conservative step-down reflecting maturity and macro uncertainty.*
2.  **2026-2030 Revenue:** I assume a **conservative tapering of growth** as the company matures and the LFL growth benefit from acquired brands like Charlotte Tilbury normalizes. The long-term growth is set well above the average global GDP but below the historical premium beauty market growth to maintain conservatism.
    *   **2026:** 5.5% Growth
    *   **2027:** 4.5% Growth
    *   **2028:** 3.5% Growth
    *   **2029:** 3.0% Growth
    *   **2030:** 2.5% Growth

| Year | 2024 (Actual) | 2025 (Projected) | 2026 (Projected) | 2027 (Projected) | 2028 (Projected) | 2029 (Projected) | 2030 (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

1.  **Net Income Margin:**
    *   **2024 Net Income Margin (Reported):** (€531 M / €4,790 M) = **11.08%**
    *   **2025-2030 Margin:** Management has guided for "Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion" in 2025, in line with the improvement achieved in 2024 (20.2%). Since net profit margin is a more conservative metric, I will use a slight expansion from the 2024 reported Net Profit margin (11.08%) to reflect operational leverage and cost discipline, as mentioned in the management commentary.

    *   *Assumption: I assume a conservative increase in Net Income Margin, topping out at 12.00%.*
        *   **2025:** 11.20% (Slight expansion)
        *   **2026:** 11.40%
        *   **2027:** 11.60%
        *   **2028:** 11.80%
        *   **2029 - 2030:** 12.00% (Maximum projected margin)

2.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
    *   **Historical ROIC:** One financial source calculates a Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) ROIC of **6.48%**.
    *   **Assumption:** Given the strong brand portfolio and market leadership, a 6.48% ROIC is a reasonable, conservative estimate. I will use a conservative **ROIC of 6.50%** on the retained Net Income from the prior year to project incremental income, following the instruction.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

This valuation uses the projected *Total Net Income / Cash Flow* as the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the first six years (2025-2030).

#### 1. Discount Rate (WACC Proxy)

A conservative but reasonable discount rate is required. Given Puig's stable premium beauty business, moderate debt-to-equity ratio, and strong market position, its cost of capital is likely lower than a high-growth tech company.

*   **Assumption:** Use a conservative discount rate of **8.0%**. This is a reasonable mid-range figure for a stable, global consumer staples/discretionary company in the current macroeconomic environment.

#### 2. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   **2030 Cash Flow (CF):** €785 M
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (g):** Must be conservative. I will use a long-term growth rate slightly below the projected 2030 growth and typical long-term global GDP growth.
    *   **Assumption:** **2.0%** (Very conservative, reflecting only inflation and long-term population growth).
*   **Terminal Value Formula (Gordon Growth Model):** TV = CF * (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)

$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{€785 \text{ M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.08 - 0.02)} = \frac{€799 \text{ M}}{0.06} = €13,317 \text{ M}
$$

#### 3. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The discount period is the number of years from the end of 2024 (when the cash flow is generated) to the end of the projection year.

| Year | Cash Flow (€M) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value (PV) (€M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | €606 | 0.9259 | €561 |
| **2026** | €651 | 0.8573 | €558 |
| **2027** | €692 | 0.7938 | €549 |
| **2028** | €729 | 0.7350 | €536 |
| **2029** | €765 | 0.6806 | €521 |
| **2030** | €785 | 0.6302 | €495 |
| **Terminal Value** | €13,317 | 0.6302 | €8,392 |
| **Total PV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **€11,612 M** |

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (€M) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Present Value of Future Cash Flows** | €11,612 M | Sum of PV of 2025-2030 CFs and Terminal Value |
| **Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents (2024)** | €883 M | From Section I. |
| **Less: Total Debt (2024)** | €2,120 M | From Section I. |
| **Total Equity Value** | **€10,375 M** | €11,612 + €883 - €2,120 |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 563.30 M | From Section I. |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **€18.42** | €10,375 M / 563.30 M |

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value (€) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **€18.42** |
| **Current Market Price (PUIG.MC)** | **€16.60** |

**Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Price)**

My calculated Fair Value of **€18.42** per share is approximately **11% higher** than the current market price of **€16.60**.

**Why my assumption is different from the market:**

The market is likely applying a higher discount rate and/or a more conservative perpetual growth rate than my model, or perhaps pricing in non-controlling interest and other liabilities more aggressively.

*   **Market's Implied Assumptions:** The market's valuation of €16.60 suggests it is anticipating a lower future cash flow stream. This could be due to:
    1.  **Lower Long-Term Growth Rate:** The market may be assuming a perpetual growth rate (g) closer to **1.0%** (instead of 2.0%) due to the company's dependency on the competitive premium beauty sector. A lower growth rate of 1.0% with an 8.0% discount rate would drop the fair value to approximately €16.60.
    2.  **Higher Discount Rate:** The market may be using a higher Discount Rate (e.g., **8.6%** instead of 8.0%) due to perceived risks not fully captured by the 8.0% WACC proxy (e.g., geopolitical risk in key markets, integration risk from acquisitions like Charlotte Tilbury, or high capital expenditure needs to maintain premium brand status). An 8.6% discount rate with a 2.0% perpetual growth rate also results in a fair value near the current market price.

**Conclusion:**

My valuation suggests that **Puig Brands S.A. (PUIGF/PUIG.MC) is slightly undervalued** at its current price of €16.60. The 11% premium is justifiable based on the company's clear strategy of outperforming the premium beauty market and the conservative growth and margin expansion guided by management. The business engine, driven by highly desirable, iconic brands like Carolina Herrera, Rabanne, and Charlotte Tilbury, supports a long-term growth rate above general inflation. The difference between my calculated value and the market price can be almost entirely explained by the market factoring in a slightly higher risk (discount rate) or slightly lower terminal growth (perpetual growth rate) than my own conservative assumptions. I would maintain that **€18.42 is a fair value** for the stock given the company's financial health (Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA comfortably below 2.0x) and strong market position.
