### Part 2: Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The revenue projections are built on a conservative business engine driven by PPG's core segments and guided by management's commentary on organic growth, share gains, and long-term macro trends. PPG's revenue is a function of: $Revenue = \text{Volume Growth} + \text{Price/Mix} + \text{Acquisitions/Divestitures}$. Since the company is focused on *organic* growth and share gains, the primary drivers are volume and price/mix.

#### Business Engine Assumptions & Justification:

1.  **Overall Organic Growth Rate:** Management projects low single-digit organic growth (2% in Q3 2025) [cite: 2, 6 in step 2]. The long-term growth assumption will be slightly above this but remain conservative, reflecting the cyclical nature of industrial coatings and architectural paint.
    *   **2025:** Start conservatively, aligning with the expected "slow start" [cite: 1 in step 1] and general macro-challenges.
    *   **2026-2028 (Recovery & Momentum):** Reflects stabilization in Europe, continued share gains in Industrial Coatings ($100M annualized target) [cite: 9 in step 2], and continued strength in high-growth segments (Aerospace, Protective & Marine).
    *   **2029-2030 (Maturity):** Growth moderates towards the long-term potential of the global coatings market.

2.  **Segment-Specific Growth Drivers (Supporting Overall Rate):**
    *   **Aerospace/Protective & Marine:** Double-digit/High single-digit growth is strong [cite: 2, 8 in step 2, 9 in step 2]. This is an "accelerator" but is a smaller portion of total sales, hence the overall number is kept low.
    *   **Industrial Coatings:** The headwind of falling prices due to index contracts will offset some volume gains, necessitating a moderate growth assumption.
    *   **Automotive OEM/Refinish:** Long-term positive fundamentals (aging fleet, new vehicle deficit) [cite: 13 in step 2] support a healthy, yet cyclical, recovery.

#### Revenue Projection Table

| Year | Rationale (Organic Growth) | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD Mil.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024E** | Baseline (LTM) | - | $15,700 |
| **2025** | Low Single Digit (Management Guidance) [cite: 6 in step 2] | 2.50% | $16,093 |
| **2026** | Modest Recovery (Share Gains, Europe Stabilization) | 3.00% | $16,576 |
| **2027** | Continued Share Gains, Aerospace/Marine Strength | 3.50% | $17,156 |
| **2028** | Stronger Recovery, Macro Tailwinds Catch Up | 4.00% | $17,842 |
| **2029** | Growth Moderates Towards Long-Term Global Coatings Rate | 3.00% | $18,377 |
| **2030** | Maturity Rate Approaching Terminal Growth | 2.50% | $18,836 |

### Part 3: Margin and Income Projections

#### Margin Assumptions and Justification:

1.  **Net Income Margin:** Management is focused on margin expansion, with segment margins improving for seven consecutive quarters [cite: 8 in step 1]. The current LTM Net Income Margin is approximately 6.5%.
    *   The long-term goal for the company is to improve profitability through restructuring, cost savings ($175M anticipated pre-tax savings from a cost-reduction program) [cite: 1 in step 1], and a shift to higher-margin segments (Aerospace, Protective & Marine).
    *   **Assumption:** The Net Income Margin will conservatively improve from a baseline of 6.5% to a high of **7.5%** by 2030, reflecting the anticipated efficiency gains, but offset by the ongoing pricing pressure in the Industrial segment and an assumption of a slightly higher effective tax rate on a larger global profit base.

2.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Historical ROIC is in the range of 8.5% to 12.5% [cite: 2 in step 2, 3 in step 2, 4 in step 2].
    *   **Assumption:** Use a conservative positive ROIC of **10.0%**. This reflects the company's commitment to "generate positive excess returns on new investments" [cite: 2 in step 2] and a healthy, yet realistic, return on reinvested net income.

#### Net Income Projection Table

The net income model assumes net income from the prior year is converted to cash and generates additional income in the subsequent year via the assumed 10.0% ROIC.

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A x B) (C) | ROIC from Prior Year Cash (D) | Total Net Income (C + D) (USD Mil.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024E** | $15,700 | 6.50% | $1,021 | - | $1,021 |
| **2025** | $16,093 | 6.70% | $1,078 | $102 | $1,180 |
| **2026** | $16,576 | 6.90% | $1,144 | $118 | $1,262 |
| **2027** | $17,156 | 7.10% | $1,218 | $126 | $1,344 |
| **2028** | $17,842 | 7.30% | $1,302 | $134 | $1,436 |
| **2029** | $18,377 | 7.40% | $1,360 | $144 | $1,504 |
| **2030** | $18,836 | 7.50% | $1,413 | $150 | $1,563 |
| **ROIC Assumption** | | | | **10.0%** | |

### Part 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### Discount and Maturity Rates:

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** A typical Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for a large, established industrial company like PPG, which operates globally in a competitive and cyclical industry, would be in the range of 8.0% to 9.5%.
    *   **Assumption:** Use a conservative, slightly elevated **9.5%** Discount Rate to reflect current high-interest rate environments and potential macroeconomic volatility.

2.  **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth):** This represents the long-term, stable growth rate of the business after the projection period. It must be very conservative.
    *   **Assumption:** Use a conservative **2.0%** Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate), which is below the expected long-term global GDP growth and the assumed organic growth in the final projection year (2.5% in 2030).

#### DCF Calculation Table

| Year | Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) (USD Mil.) | Discount Factor (9.5%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (USD Mil.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,180 | 0.913 | $1,077 |
| **2026** | $1,262 | 0.834 | $1,053 |
| **2027** | $1,344 | 0.762 | $1,024 |
| **2028** | $1,436 | 0.696 | $999 |
| **2029** | $1,504 | 0.636 | $956 |
| **2030** | $1,563 | 0.581 | $908 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **$6,017** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{\$1,563 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.095 - 0.02} = \frac{\$1,594}{\text{0.075}} = \$21,253 \text{ Million}$$

#### Terminal Value Net Present Value (NPV)

The present value of the Terminal Value is:
$$\text{NPV of } TV = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$
$$\text{NPV of } TV = \$21,253 \times 0.581 = \$12,347 \text{ Million}$$

#### Total Enterprise Value (EV)

$$\text{Total EV} = \text{NPV of Explicit Period} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$$
$$\text{Total EV} = \$6,017 + \$12,347 = \$18,364 \text{ Million}$$

---

### Part 5: Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total EV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$
$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$18,364 + \$1,900 - \$7,940 = \$12,324 \text{ Million}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$
$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$12,324 \text{ Million}}{225.7 \text{ Million}} = \$54.60$$

---

### Part 6: Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$54.60** |
| **Current Market Price (Approx.)** | $105.24 [cite: 7 in step 2] |
| **Difference** | $(-\$50.64)$ |

#### Justification for Discrepancy

**The calculated Fair Value of $54.60 is significantly lower (approx. 48% below) the current market price of $105.24.**

This large discrepancy suggests the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about PPG's future performance than the conservative DCF model presented here.

**Market Assumptions vs. Conservative Model:**

1.  **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Conservative Model:** Assumes an average organic revenue growth of **~3.1%** from 2025-2030, with a conservative terminal growth of 2.0%. This factors in continued pressure from cyclical industrial/architectural markets and price pressure from index contracts.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market is likely pricing in a more successful transition to high-growth segments (Aerospace, Protective & Marine), successful execution of its $175M cost-saving program, and a much faster/stronger recovery in core markets (Europe, Industrial, Auto Refinish). A higher sustained organic growth rate (**4.5% - 5.5%**) would be required to close this gap.

2.  **Margin Expansion (Net Income Margin):**
    *   **Conservative Model:** Projects Net Income Margin to improve modestly from 6.5% to only **7.5%** by 2030.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market likely assumes PPG will achieve and *sustain* a higher margin, perhaps closer to its pre-pandemic peak or peer average, implying a Net Income Margin in the range of **8.5% to 9.5%** by 2030. The market believes the cost-saving and restructuring efforts will translate into significant, sustained operating leverage.

3.  **Discount Rate and Risk:**
    *   **Conservative Model:** Uses a high Discount Rate of **9.5%**, indicating a higher perception of risk and cost of capital.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market may be using a lower WACC/Discount Rate (**8.0% - 8.5%**) due to PPG's status as a 'Dividend King' (53 consecutive years of dividend increases) [cite: 1 in step 1] and perceived stability, thereby placing a higher value on all future cash flows.

**Conclusion:**

The conservative assumptions about the pace of margin expansion and the long-term organic revenue growth, coupled with a high discount rate, are the primary drivers of the low fair value. For the market price to be justified, PPG must successfully deliver on its operational promises: achieving and sustaining high-single-digit margin expansion and realizing an accelerated, high-single-digit organic revenue growth by leveraging its specialty segments and market share gains across the board. The market is pricing in near-perfect execution and a quick, robust recovery.
