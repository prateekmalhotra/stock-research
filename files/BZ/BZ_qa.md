## Business Summary

Kanzhun Limited runs a popular online job platform called BOSS Zhipin, which primarily operates within mainland China. Its core business model centers on directly connecting job seekers with company bosses or hiring managers using a smartphone app. Unlike traditional platforms, it emphasizes direct chat and uses smart technology to recommend the best candidates to the right jobs quickly. The company earns revenue mainly by charging businesses (B2B customers), especially small and medium-sized enterprises, subscription fees for premium services, better visibility for job postings, and access to more candidates. Job seekers generally use the service for free.

## Business Model Risk

The largest immediate risk is continued regulatory scrutiny from the Chinese government. Kanzhun previously faced a significant government review that barred it from onboarding new users for several months in 2021, severely harming growth and market perception. This threat remains constant and could instantly halt operations or impose heavy fines. Long-term risks include intense competition in the mainland Chinese online recruitment market, which could erode pricing power if rivals develop better matching algorithms or offer cheaper services. Furthermore, since the company’s earnings depend entirely on corporate hiring budgets, any significant economic slowdown or increasing unemployment in China would cause companies to reduce their recruitment spending, directly lowering Kanzhun's subscription revenue and future earning potential.

## Company History

Kanzhun Limited, operating the mobile app **BOSS Zhipin** (meaning "Boss Direct Hire" in Chinese), is a leading online recruitment platform in China. Its history is a story of disrupting traditional job markets by focusing on direct communication and smart technology.

### **Inception and Founding Goal (The "Why")**

1.  **Original Foundation (2014):** The company, Kanzhun Limited, was founded by Peng Zhao on January 16, 2014. It initially started as a website focused on providing company reviews, a step that helped them understand the inner workings and needs of businesses.
2.  **The Problem with Traditional Recruitment:** In the past, the job hunting process was often slow, impersonal, and frustrating, relying heavily on intermediaries (recruiters or HR departments) which created distance between a job seeker and the actual hiring manager (the "Boss").
3.  **The Birth of BOSS Zhipin (The Solution):** Kanzhun Limited launched its flagship mobile application, **BOSS Zhipin**, to solve this problem by creating a "direct hire" model.
4.  **The Core Goal:** The company's mission became connecting job seekers and hiring managers (referred to as "Bosses") in the most direct, efficient, and seamless way possible, ultimately giving job seekers more power and a direct voice in the process.

### **Innovative Solutions and Rapid Growth (What Worked)**

5.  **Direct Chat is the Difference:** The core feature that set BOSS Zhipin apart was allowing **instant, direct chat** between job seekers and the actual "Bosses" or senior hiring managers. This removed the bureaucratic layers of traditional recruiting, making the process much faster and more transparent.
6.  **AI-Powered Matching:** They built a mobile-native platform driven by proprietary **Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms** and big data. This technology intelligently matches a user's background and desired role with suitable job postings and "Bosses," replacing generic mass applications with precise recommendations.
7.  **Respecting Job Seekers:** The platform's operating philosophy is rooted in respecting job seekers. For instance, it is designed so employers cannot access a job seeker's resume unless the job seeker gives their explicit consent, empowering the individual user.
8.  **Rapid Expansion:** The innovative and efficient model attracted significant investment from notable backers like Tencent. The company grew quickly, becoming the largest online recruitment platform in China by average Monthly Active Users (MAU).

### **Headwinds and Tailwinds (Challenges and Opportunities)**

9.  **Tailwind - Mobile and Tech Adoption:** The company greatly benefited from the strong tailwind of China's immense and growing mobile internet penetration and the widespread adoption of AI technology, which their entire business model is built upon.
10. **Tailwind - IPO Success (2021):** The company achieved a major milestone by holding its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq in June 2021, raising a significant amount of capital and seeing its shares almost double on the first day of trading.
11. **Major Headwind - Government Review (2021):** A significant challenge arose in July 2021 when the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced a cybersecurity review related to the company's collection and use of personal information.
12. **The Resulting Problem:** As a direct consequence of the review, Kanzhun was ordered to halt new user registration for nearly a year, which temporarily slowed its growth and disrupted business operations.
13. **Dealing with the Headwind:** Kanzhun fully cooperated with the regulatory body, rectified the issues identified, and was successfully approved to resume new user registration in June 2022.
14. **Strategic Move - Dual Listing (2022):** In response to broader US-China geopolitical tensions and market uncertainties, Kanzhun completed a dual listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December 2022. This move helped secure its access to capital, diversify its investor base, and mitigate geopolitical risks.

### **The Company Today (Present Day)**

15. **Continued Growth and Focus:** Kanzhun Limited continues to show strong financial performance, with increasing revenues and a growing user base, confirming the success of its business model.
16. **Expanding to Blue-Collar Jobs (2024):** The company is strategically expanding its reach beyond traditional white-collar jobs. In 2024, it acquired WD Technology to further scale its business in the blue-collar and manufacturing recruitment markets.
17. **Serving Diverse Businesses:** Today, while its platform is used by major companies, it is particularly popular with Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs), with a large majority of its customers being companies with fewer than 100 employees, demonstrating its reach across the economy.

## Moat Analysis

Kanzhun Limited's (BZ) competitive advantage, or "moat," is primarily built upon a powerful **network effect** rooted in its unique product design, which allows it to dominate the direct recruitment market in China.

### Analysis of Kanzhun's Moat (BOSS Zhipin)

1.  **Unique Product Differentiation (The Core Advantage):** Kanzhun's platform, BOSS Zhipin, pioneered a **mobile-native direct recruitment model** that facilitates instant, direct chat and communication between job seekers and hiring managers ("Bosses").
2.  **Differentiation from Competitors:** Traditional competitors were primarily "resume-centric" digital job boards, acting like directories. BOSS Zhipin shifted the focus to **communication and interaction**, making the hiring process faster, more transparent, and more efficient for both sides.
3.  **Powerful Network Effects (The Moat Itself):** As more job seekers join the platform, it becomes more valuable for employers, and as more employers (with diverse job postings) join, it becomes more valuable for job seekers. This self-reinforcing loop is a **flywheel effect** that attracts a massive user base (e.g., over 50 million monthly active users) and makes it increasingly difficult for a new competitor to catch up.
4.  **Reason for Growth:** The direct recruitment model was a disruptive innovation in the Chinese market, which quickly drove rapid user adoption and market share gains, allowing the company to leapfrog older, slower, and more traditional competitors.
5.  **Pricing Power and Special Position:** The company has a strong position as the largest online recruitment platform in China by both revenue and monthly active users. This market leadership, combined with enhanced monetization capabilities, has resulted in a steady-to-increasing **Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPPU)**, which indicates a degree of pricing power with its enterprise customers.

### Durability and Stickiness

1.  **Ease of Displacement:** It would be very difficult for a competitor with more capital to displace Kanzhun. While a large marketing budget can attract users, it cannot instantly replicate the platform's **network density**—the sheer volume of both active employers and job seekers who can immediately find a match. The platform's moat is "narrow" but formidable due to this two-sided network.
2.  **Customer and Contract Stickiness:** The business model is inherently recurring, as the vast majority of revenue comes from **paid enterprise customers** who have a constant, ongoing need to hire new talent. The company's goal is to increase user engagement and retention, which drives that recurring revenue.
3.  **Moat-Building Strategy: Investment in Technology:** Kanzhun has made significant and growing investments in Research & Development (R&D), with R&D expenses increasing substantially in recent years (e.g., by 17.6% in 2024). This investment is focused on developing proprietary AI and machine learning algorithms to improve the platform's **matching efficiency** and user experience.
4.  **Need for Innovation:** Yes, the company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge. Kanzhun is actively exploring cutting-edge AI, even developing its own large language model, "Nanbeige," to further enhance its core matching technology and operational efficiency, positioning itself at the forefront of the industry. This continuous technological investment ensures its AI-driven matching remains superior to competitors.

## Catalyst Analysis

Kanzhun Limited (BZ), operating the BOSS Zhipin platform, is a leading online recruitment company in China whose stock catalysts are driven by its dominant market position, expansion into new user segments, and commitment to shareholder returns.

## Near-Term Stock Price Catalysts

1.  **Shareholder Return Programs:** The company recently announced the adoption of an annual dividend policy and declared a cash dividend, which typically attracts a broader base of investors looking for income. Furthermore, the upsizing and extension of the share repurchase program demonstrates management's confidence and can directly support the stock price by reducing the number of outstanding shares.
2.  **Sustained Profitability and Margin Expansion:** In the second quarter of 2025, the company achieved a record-high adjusted operating margin of 41.9%, indicating strong operational leverage. Continued better-than-expected margins and net income growth could drive the stock price up as they signal improved business efficiency.
3.  **Blue-Collar and Lower-Tier City Monetization:** Management has consistently highlighted the strategy of expanding into blue-collar sectors and lower-tier cities as a growth driver. Successful execution and increased revenue contribution from these previously under-monetized segments, such as through the "Coach Project," is a near-term catalyst.

## Long-Term Stock Price Catalysts and Management Strategy

1.  **Deepening User Base and Market Dominance:** The company's core "Direct Recruitment Model" promotes instant direct chat between employers and job seekers, which is a key differentiator and a growth driver for its massive user base, with average monthly active users (MAU) reaching 58 million by Q3 2024. Sustaining this user and paid customer growth is essential for long-term revenue stability.
2.  **Technology and AI Integration:** Management states that their mobile-native product uses proprietary AI algorithms and big data to deliver accurate recommendation results, which is key to their recruitment efficiency. Ongoing investment in technology and AI will be crucial to maintaining a competitive edge and increasing the average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) over time.
3.  **International Expansion:** The company has initiated efforts to expand into overseas markets. While early, successful progress in an international market offers a massive potential for diversification and a significant new long-term revenue stream beyond the domestic Chinese market.
4.  **Operational Efficiency and Marketing Leverage:** Management expects the trend of enhanced marketing efficiency to continue due to strong brand recognition and the network effect inherent in the business. This focus on cost control and brand power helps turn user and revenue growth into higher profit growth over the long term.

5.  **Recent Management Change:** In August 2025, Mr. Xu Chen was appointed to the new role of President to optimize the governance structure and improve organizational efficiency, reporting directly to Mr. Zhao.

### **Track Record and Key Decisions**

1.  **Market Leadership & Technology:** The company was founded on the idea of direct connections between job seekers and employers, leveraging AI for recommendation algorithms, which drove it to become the largest online recruitment platform in China.
2.  **Shareholder Value Creation:** Management has delivered robust financial growth, with 2024 revenue increasing by 23.6% and net income by 42.6% year-over-year. They have committed to enhancing shareholder returns through a significant share repurchase program and the adoption of an annual dividend policy.
3.  **Delivering on Promises:** Management has consistently met or exceeded financial guidance, with Q1 2024 financial metrics surpassing expectations and a strategic focus on blue-collar penetration progressing well. They have shown strong operational efficiency, increasing both adjusted gross and operating profit margins through Q3 2024.
4.  **Navigating Major Challenges:** After the 2021 Nasdaq IPO, Kanzhun faced a cybersecurity review by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which halted new user registration for nearly a year; management successfully rectified the issues, allowing new registration to resume in mid-2022.
5.  **Capital Markets Strategy:** Key decisions include a successful U.S. IPO on the Nasdaq in 2021 and a follow-up dual-listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2022, which provided a hedge against potential U.S. delisting fears.

### **Future Strategy and Investor Perception**

1.  **Strategic Vision:** The future strategy is focused on leveraging technology and expanding its market reach, with key pillars including deepening penetration into the blue-collar segment (targeting 43% of total revenue by 2027) and expanding to non-tier-1 cities.
2.  **AI Integration:** The management's core technological focus includes integrating its proprietary large language model, "Nanbeige," and DeepSeek to launch AI-powered products and solutions for both job seekers and recruiters.
3.  **Growth Targets:** The company aims for continued high growth, projecting to add at least 35 million new unique users in 2025 and expecting revenue growth of up to 12.7% year-over-year for Q1 2025. They are also concentrating on maintaining full-year profitability through refined cost and management controls.
4.  **Investor Popularity & Sentiment:** Kanzhun generally holds a positive consensus rating of "Buy" from analysts. Management's commitment to regular dividends and an expanded buyback program is viewed as a measure to attract income-focused investors and potentially help close a valuation gap relative to peers. However, some investor skepticism has arisen when revenue guidance is only met at the low end, which has caused share price volatility despite strong profit growth.

## Management Incentive

Based on the review of Kanzhun Limited's (BZ) Form 20-F filings (or equivalent foreign company disclosure), the analysis of management incentive and compensation is as follows:

### Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation for Kanzhun Limited (BZ)

#### 1. Insider Ownership and Corporate Control

*   **High Control via Weighted Voting Rights (WVR) Structure:** Kanzhun operates under a WVR structure, where its Class B Ordinary Shares are entitled to **ten votes per share** on most matters, compared to one vote per Class A share.
*   **Founder's Consolidated Control:** The Class B shares are held through a trust for the benefit of the Founder, Chairman, and CEO, Mr. Peng Zhao, and his family, which gives him **substantial control** over company decisions and voting outcomes despite his economic interest being diluted by Class A shares.
*   **Substantial Economic Stake:** As of December 31, 2024, the total Class B Ordinary Shares (held by the founder/CEO and family) represent approximately **18.2% of the total issued and outstanding shares** on a fully converted basis, indicating a significant personal economic interest tied to the company's value.

#### 2. Compensation Structure

*   **Heavily Equity-Focused Compensation:** Kanzhun's compensation model is heavily weighted toward equity awards, which is a strong mechanism for aligning management with shareholder returns.
*   **Massive Share-Based Compensation:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company recorded an aggregate of **RMB 1.1 billion (US$156.7 million)** in share-based compensation expenses. This figure is substantially higher than the cash compensation paid to the entire group of directors and executive officers.
*   **Low Relative Cash Compensation:** The aggregate cash compensation paid to all directors and executive officers as a group in 2024 was relatively small at approximately **RMB 25.7 million (US$3.5 million)**, demonstrating that short-term cash salary is not the primary driver of total pay.
*   **Purpose of Share-Based Awards:** The share incentive plans are explicitly designed to "attract and retain qualified employees, provide incentives to our directors and employees, and promote the success of our business," indicating a stated goal of performance-based alignment.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive and Alignment

Management has **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders,** primarily due to the structure of their compensation and the CEO's significant, though disproportionately weighted, economic interest.

*   **Strong Alignment with Shareholder Value:** The compensation structure is fundamentally designed to align management with shareholders, as the overwhelming majority of their potential wealth is tied to the long-term appreciation of Kanzhun's stock price via massive equity awards. Management's personal wealth growth directly depends on growing the overall market capitalization.
*   **High-Risk for Minority Governance:** While the economic incentives are aligned, the **WVR structure** gives the Founder/CEO (Mr. Peng Zhao) **disproportionate voting power** compared to his economic interest, meaning he maintains firm control over the board and strategic decisions, which limits the ability of minority shareholders to exercise corporate governance oversight.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** The management is **incentivized to grow the share price and long-term value** of the company due to the dominance of equity-based pay. The control structure, while providing minimal direct governance rights to public shareholders, ensures the primary insider with the largest aligned economic interest controls the company.

## Price History

Based on the recent price history and analysis of Kanzhun Limited (BZ), here is a breakdown of its stock performance.

1.  **Current Price Relative to 52-Week Range:** The stock is currently trading significantly closer to its 52-week high than its low. As of the market close on October 18, 2025, the price of \$21.68 is well above the 52-week low of \$12.17 and not far below the 52-week high of \$25.26.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Kanzhun Limited (BZ) is currently **approximately 78.22%** above its 52-week low of \$12.17. This indicates a strong upward trend over the past year.

3.  **Technical Analysis: Is it Trading Low?** Based on its position near the top of its 52-week range, the stock is technically **not trading low**. Analysis from some moving averages (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs) suggests a longer-term **Buy** signal, as the price is above these key averages, but other short-term technical indicators show mixed to **Sell** signals.

4.  **Significant Rally Explained (Up Bigly):** The stock has experienced a significant rally, with a **101.24% return over the last year** and a **37.18% return over the last three months** as of September 2025. This substantial performance is driven by positive financial results and improved investor sentiment.

5.  **Reason for Recent Price Surge:** A major factor behind the rally includes Kanzhun's second-quarter 2025 earnings, which surpassed analyst expectations for both Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenue. The company's strong, superb revenue growth over the last three years has also contributed to an elevated valuation and investor confidence.

6.  **Analyst Consensus:** The consensus rating among analysts covering the stock is generally a **"Strong Buy,"** although the average 12-month price target suggests a small decrease from the most recent price.

---

## Long Thesis

Kanzhun Limited (BOSS Zhipin) is positioned for significant growth because its unique, direct chat platform has created a powerful network effect that dominates the Chinese recruitment market. In the near term, strong operational efficiency is driving record high profit margins, which, coupled with new dividends and stock buybacks, will support the stock price. Long term, the company will maintain its market leadership and increase revenues by successfully expanding into the massive blue-collar and lower-tier city segments, while continuous investment in proprietary AI keeps its job-matching technology far superior to competitors, allowing it to increase the fees charged to businesses.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several critical assumptions: 1) The Chinese regulatory environment remains stable, and the company is not subjected to further major government-imposed restrictions on user growth or data usage. 2) The Chinese economy avoids a severe downturn that would drastically reduce corporate hiring budgets. 3) Kanzhun successfully executes its strategic expansion into the blue-collar segment, making it a major new revenue driver. 4) The company’s continuous investment in proprietary AI (like Nanbeige) successfully maintains its competitive edge in matching efficiency against rivals.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and holes in the long thesis for Kanzhun Limited (BZ), primarily by challenging the core assumptions with current market and operational data.

## Flaws and Faults in the Long Thesis

### 1. Challenge to the "Stable Regulatory Environment" Assumption
The assumption that the Chinese regulatory environment will remain stable is a major risk. Despite a recent easing of the prior tech crackdown, the risk of "mounting regulation" and "rising regulatory scrutiny" remains an overhang for Chinese technology companies, threatening Kanzhun's market size and adding volatility to future margins. Any new government-imposed restrictions on user growth or data usage, which has happened previously, could instantly disrupt the stated network effect and profitability model.

### 2. Challenge to the "Chinese Economy Avoids a Severe Downturn" Assumption
The economic reality in China directly contradicts the assumption that a severe downturn will be avoided. The country is facing significant macro headwinds, including a depressed property sector, deflationary pressures, weak consumer confidence, over-investment, and high local government debt, which creates a highly uncertain hiring environment. Furthermore, the company itself noted "recruitment demand weakened" in the latter half of Q2 2024, indicating that corporate hiring budgets—the company's revenue source—are already under pressure, potentially limiting future revenue growth and the ability to increase fees.

### 3. Challenge to the "Superior AI" Claim and Monetization Strategy
The claim that Kanzhun's proprietary AI (like Nanbeige) will keep its technology "far superior to competitors" is questionable based on its cautious strategic approach. Kanzhun is positioning its AI as an "enhancement layer" to assist human recruiters, while a key competitor, Tongdao Liepin, is pursuing a more disruptive strategy using AI to automate and replace large parts of the recruitment process, potentially leading to a more efficient, success-based monetization model. If a competitor’s AI-driven, high-automation model proves more cost-effective and efficient for businesses, Kanzhun’s more human-centric model may lose its competitive edge over the long term.

### 4. Expansion into Blue-Collar is a Low-Margin Trade-Off
While the thesis correctly identifies the blue-collar segment as a massive growth area (already accounting for 38% of 2024 revenue), the nature of this segment presents a risk to the "record high profit margins" thesis. This segment is typically characterized by lower average revenue per paying user (ARPPU), higher churn, and higher operational complexity (e.g., integrity risk, logistics), which could exert downward pressure on overall profit margins and require high, sustained investment to maintain the market share.

### 5. High Valuation Already Prices in the Bull Case Success
The strong near-term operational efficiency, record margins, and growth forecasts cited in the bull case appear to be fully reflected in the stock’s current high valuation metrics, such as high earnings multiples and enterprise value to sales. This high valuation means the stock is vulnerable to a sharp correction if Kanzhun fails to successfully execute any of its major growth initiatives (like the blue-collar expansion) or if macro-economic factors lead to even slightly missed earnings forecasts.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Kanzhun Limited (BZ)

**Kanzhun Limited (BZ) is exposed to significant downside risk because its premium valuation fails to account for a weakening Chinese economy, an inherent margin trade-off in its core growth segment, and a conservative AI strategy that risks falling behind competitors with more disruptive models.**

1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds Will Crush Corporate Hiring:** Continued deflationary pressures and a structural downturn in the Chinese economy, particularly due to the distressed property and manufacturing sectors, will force companies to slash hiring budgets, directly limiting Kanzhun's ability to increase its average fees (ARPPU) and substantially slowing new customer growth.
2.  **Regulatory Volatility is an Unpriced Risk:** The assumption of a stable regulatory environment is misplaced; any re-escalation of scrutiny or new data/user privacy restrictions from the CCP could instantly negate the network effect and force a rapid increase in compliance costs, directly reversing the current trend of "record high profit margins."
3.  **The Blue-Collar Strategy Will Dilute Margins:** The strategic focus on the blue-collar segment, while providing volume, involves structurally lower-margin and higher-cost operations than white-collar recruitment, ultimately serving as a drag on the company’s current high profitability and leading to an inevitable cooling off of adjusted operating margin expansion.
4.  **AI Is an Enhancement, Not a Moat:** Kanzhun’s cautious AI approach risks ceding the long-term competitive lead to rivals who are embracing full-scale AI automation to replace human recruiters and charging success-based fees; this conservative strategy may prevent Kanzhun from achieving the next level of operational efficiency and revenue growth the bull case promises.
5.  **Valuation Leaves No Margin of Safety:** The company's high valuation multiples already price in flawless execution and substantial, sustained high-margin growth, leaving the stock highly sensitive to any negative news—be it from a revenue deceleration due to economic weakness or a failure to meet ambitious targets in the blue-collar market.

---

## Next Steps

The existing analysis provides a strong foundation, particularly on the company's competitive moat, management, and the core conflict between growth (blue-collar) and risk (macro/regulation).

The most important questions that remain are quantitative and comparative, needed to properly weigh the Bear Case against the Long Thesis. Specifically, the high valuation claim and the margin trade-off require concrete data to resolve.

Here are the next steps you should investigate:

1.  **Quantify the Valuation Discrepancy with Peers.**
    *   The "High Valuation" bear case is currently an assertion. You need to find the specific **Forward P/E, EV/Sales, and EV/EBITDA** multiples for Kanzhun (**BZ**) and its primary Chinese rivals (e.g., **51Job, Tongdao Liepin**) to determine if the premium is justified or excessive.

2.  **Investigate Real-World Macroeconomic Impact on Pricing (ARPPU).**
    *   While the bear case suggests macro headwinds will crush pricing, recent Q2 2025 results indicated that **Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPPU) remained stable and saw modest growth**, mainly due to key account expansion.
    *   *Next Step:* Focus on the detailed breakdown of the "modest growth" in ARPPU. Is the modest overall growth masking a decline in ARPPU for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) (the majority of its customer base), while Key Account growth carries the whole number? Search for more granularity on **SME vs. Key Account ARPPU trends**.

3.  **Determine the True Profitability of the Blue-Collar Segment.**
    *   The bear case argues blue-collar expansion (38% of 2024 revenue) will dilute margins.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for any management commentary, analyst models, or presentation slides that provide a **segment-by-segment profitability breakdown** (e.g., gross margin or operating margin for the white-collar vs. blue-collar service lines) to prove or disprove the margin-dilution argument.

4.  **Evaluate Competitor AI Strategy in Detail.**
    *   The bear case raises a risk that a competitor (like Tongdao Liepin) might use more disruptive, fully automated AI models.
    *   *Next Step:* Research the specific AI products and monetization strategies of a direct competitor, such as "Tongdao Liepin," to compare their "success-based" fee models with Kanzhun’s subscription model. The goal is to see if their model genuinely offers a more cost-effective alternative for B2B customers.

5.  **Analyze the Impact of Shareholder Return Programs.**
    *   Kanzhun has committed to a new dividend and a share repurchase program.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for analyst commentary or trading data since the dividend/buyback announcement in Q2 2025 to gauge the **market's reaction and the quantitative effect of the buybacks** on earnings per share (EPS) acceleration.
