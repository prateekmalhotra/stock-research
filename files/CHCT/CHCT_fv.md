### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection Justification**

The business of CHCT, as a Healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), is fundamentally driven by two factors: **rental escalators** on its existing portfolio (organic growth) and **new property acquisitions** (external growth).

#### **A. Revenue Engine Assumptions**

1.  **Organic Growth (Rental Escalators):**
    *   **Assumption:** A conservative **2.0%** annual rent escalator on the existing portfolio. This is a common and conservative assumption for long-term leases in the healthcare REIT sector.
2.  **External Growth (Acquisitions):**
    *   **Management Guidance:** CHCT has signed definitive agreements for new investments of **\$146 million** at an expected annual return (cap rate) ranging from 9.1% to 9.75%, closing throughout 2026 and 2027. [cite: 5 in Step 2]
    *   **Conservative Acquisition Cap Rate:** We will use the conservative end of the guidance: **9.1%**.
    *   **Acquisition Schedule:** I will model a conservative, equal-split closing over the two years for the \$146 million in total expected investment, with a half-year of revenue generated in the closing year. Since the company did not sell equity due to its "currently depressed share price," this acquisition program will be assumed to be debt-funded at the historical interest rate of ~5.3% (per Q1 2025 supplemental) to maintain the conservative cash-flow-first approach.
        *   **2026 Acquisition Value:** \$73.0 million
        *   **2027 Acquisition Value:** \$73.0 million
        *   **Revenue from Acquisitions:** Acquisition Value * 9.1% Cap Rate.
    *   **Post-2027 Acquisitions:** Given the market reluctance to raise capital due to the depressed share price (no ATM activity reported) [cite: 5 in Step 2], new acquisitions after the current pipeline are assumed to cease (**\$0 for 2028-2030**) to maintain an appropriately conservative outlook and reflect capital market challenges.

#### **B. Revenue Projection (in millions USD)**

| Year | Beginning Revenue (A) | Organic Growth (A x 2.0%) | New Acq. Revenue | Total Revenue (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | \$116.40 | - | - | **\$116.40** |
| **2025** | \$116.40 | \$2.33 | \$0.00 | **\$118.73** |
| **2026** | \$118.73 | \$2.37 | \$3.32 (73M * 9.1% * 0.5yr) | **\$124.42** |
| **2027** | \$124.42 | \$2.49 | \$6.64 (73M * 9.1% * 1yr) + \$3.32 (New Acq * 0.5yr) | **\$136.87** |
| **2028** | \$136.87 | \$2.74 | \$0.00 (Existing Acq full year + 2.0% on all) | **\$139.61** |
| **2029** | \$139.61 | \$2.79 | \$0.00 | **\$142.40** |
| **2030** | \$142.40 | \$2.85 | \$0.00 | **\$145.25** |

*Note: New Acquisition Revenue for a full year is $73M * 9.1% = $6.64M. The model assumes a half-year effect in the closing year and a full-year effect thereafter.*

### **3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection**

#### **A. Margin and ROIC Justification**

1.  **Net Margin (for Net Income):**
    *   As a REIT, CHCT's Net Income is a poor proxy for cash flow due to large non-cash depreciation and amortization, often resulting in net losses (e.g., Q2 2025 net loss of \$12.6 million).
    *   To comply with the rule to use Net Income, but also to comply with the rule to be *conservative* and avoid using an unsustainable negative margin, I will assume an extremely conservative, low Net Margin of **2.5%** of Revenue. This is a pragmatic adjustment to reflect *some* level of sustainable profitability for the purpose of this DCF model.

2.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
    *   The user specifies using a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC when the past ROIC is negative.
    *   **Assumption:** A conservative ROIC of **3.0%** will be applied to the prior year's accumulated Net Income (treated as cash) to generate additional income in the following year.

#### **B. Discounted Cash Flow Model (in millions USD)**

| Year | Revenue | Net Income (2.5% Margin) (A) | Prior Year Cash (B) | ROIC Income (B x 3.0%) (C) | Total CF / NI (A + C) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$118.73 | \$2.97 | \$0.00 | \$0.00 | \$2.97 | \$2.60 |
| **2026** | \$124.42 | \$3.11 | \$2.97 | \$0.09 | \$3.20 | \$2.48 |
| **2027** | \$136.87 | \$3.42 | \$6.17 | \$0.19 | \$3.61 | \$2.42 |
| **2028** | \$139.61 | \$3.49 | \$9.78 | \$0.29 | \$3.78 | \$2.31 |
| **2029** | \$142.40 | \$3.56 | \$13.56 | \$0.41 | \$3.97 | \$2.17 |
| **2030** | \$145.25 | \$3.63 | \$17.53 | \$0.53 | \$4.16 | \$2.02 |
| **Total NPV of CF (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **\$14.00** |

### **4. Discount Rate and Terminal Value Justification**

1.  **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):**
    *   Given the highly volatile stock price, negative net income, and high dividend yield (13.02% yield in one snippet), a high discount rate is warranted to capture the risk. A REIT generally has a lower WACC, but for a DCF focused on Net Income, a higher discount rate is necessary.
    *   **Assumption:** Conservative Discount Rate (r) = **12.0%**. This is high and conservative for a real estate entity, reflecting the current interest rate environment and market risk.
2.  **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):**
    *   The long-term growth rate for the entire US economy.
    *   **Assumption:** Conservative Maturity Rate (g) = **2.0%**. This is a standard, low terminal growth rate.
3.  **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**
    *   Terminal Value = [2030 Net Income * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
    *   Terminal Value = [\$4.16M * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.12 - 0.02)
    *   Terminal Value = \$4.24M / 0.10 = **\$42.40 million**
4.  **Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value:**
    *   NPV of TV = TV / $(1 + r)^{t}$
    *   NPV of TV = \$42.40M / $(1 + 0.12)^{6}$ = **\$21.49 million**

### **5. Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$14.00 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | \$21.49 |
| **Total Equity Value (NPV of All Future Cash Flows)** | **\$35.49** |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$4.86 |
| Less: Total Debt | (\$500.08) |
| **Total Firm Fair Value** | **(\$459.73)** |
| **Common Shares Outstanding** | 28.37 million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **(\$16.21)** |

## **Valuation Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value per Share:** **-\$16.21**

**Current Market Value per Share (CHCT):** **\$14.59**

### **Justification for the Discrepancy (Negative Fair Value)**

The DCF calculation results in a negative fair value per share, which is highly divergent from the current market price of \$14.59. This disparity is entirely a result of the strict application of the user's two key rules, which fundamentally conflict with the valuation of a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT):

1.  **The "Net Income is Cash" Rule:** The user's rule dictates that **Net Income** for a given year is the cash flow. For a REIT, Net Income is artificially suppressed and often negative due to massive **non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses**. The true, industry-standard measure of cash flow for a REIT is **Funds From Operations (FFO)** or **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)**, which CHCT's management provides and which are consistently positive (e.g., Q2 2025 AFFO was \$0.50 per diluted share, or a \$56.74 million annual run-rate). [cite: 5 in Step 2]
2.  **The "Net Income Margin" Constraint:** The use of a conservative $2.5\%$ Net Margin on a growing revenue base is insufficient to overcome the burden of the existing **\$500.08 million in debt**.

#### **Market Assumptions vs. Model Assumptions**

*   **Market Assumption:** The market is valuing CHCT based on its actual cash flow, likely using a multiple of its positive **AFFO** or similar cash-based metric. If the model were to use the Q2 2025 AFFO run rate of **\$56.74 million** as the baseline cash flow instead of the projected Net Income of \$2.97M, the valuation would be significantly positive.
*   **Model Assumption (Due to Rules):** Our model's conservative assumptions, specifically the mandated use of **Net Income** which is near-zero to slightly positive (after correcting for large one-time losses), cannot cover the company's substantial debt. The DCF is calculating the value of the firm's *profits* after non-cash expenses, and those profits are too small to justify the debt burden over a six-year period with only 2.0% organic growth.

**Conclusion:** The negative fair value of -\$16.21 per share is a technical artifact of the DCF model constraints (Net Income as cash flow) applied to a REIT business structure. The market is making a rational assumption that CHCT's business engine generates significant positive **cash flow (AFFO)**, which the company has a track record of demonstrating, justifying the current price of **\$14.59** per share. A conservative DCF using an AFFO proxy would likely result in a positive, but still discounted, fair value compared to the current price, indicating the market is pricing in either a quick recovery in the share price for capital raising or a higher long-term growth rate/lower discount rate than our conservative assumptions.
