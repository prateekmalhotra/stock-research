### **Valuation of Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated (CHCT)**

This valuation uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on projected Net Income, a key metric for equity holders in a REIT, though FFO/AFFO is a better proxy for cash flow. Per instruction, Net Income will be used and adjusted for re-investment via a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) model.

### **2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

**Business Engine Justification:**
CHCT is a healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) focused on acquiring and owning non-urban medical facilities. The core business engine drives revenue through two primary components:
1.  **Acquisitions of new properties (Growth Capital):** This is the main growth driver. The company has a pipeline of acquisitions and expects a return (cap rate) of **9.1% to 9.75%** on new investments.
2.  **Contractual Rent Escalators (Organic Growth):** Existing leases include annual rent increases. A conservative, long-term estimate for this organic growth, typical for non-urban medical office leases, is assumed to be **1.5% annually**.

**Revenue Projection Assumptions:**

*   **Base Year Revenue (2024):** $115.79 million.
*   **Acquisition-Driven Revenue:** Management has cited a **$146 million acquisition pipeline**. To be conservative, I will assume this pipeline is funded and closed over the next four years (2025-2028), adding **$36.5 million** in new property investments each year. I will apply a conservative cap rate (yield) of **9.1%** to the new investment. This is a direct, management-guided internal metric.
    *   New Annual Revenue from Acquisitions = $36.5M * 9.1% = **$3.32 million** per year (for 2025-2028).
*   **Organic Growth (Rent Escalators):** A conservative annual organic growth rate of **1.5%** is applied to the prior year's stabilized revenue (revenue *excluding* new acquisition revenue from the current year).
*   **Post-Acquisition Pipeline (2029-2030):** After the initial pipeline is exhausted, new acquisition volume is assumed to drop to **$0** to maintain a conservative outlook. Growth reverts solely to the **1.5%** organic rent escalator.

| Year | Annual Organic Growth | New Property Investment ($M) | New Acquisition Revenue @ 9.1% Cap Rate ($M) | Total Revenue ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | - | - | - | $115.79 |
| **2025** | 1.5% on $115.79M | $36.50 | $3.32 | **$120.85** |
| **2026** | 1.5% on $120.85M | $36.50 | $3.32 | **$125.99** |
| **2027** | 1.5% on $125.99M | $36.50 | $3.32 | **$131.25** |
| **2028** | 1.5% on $131.25M | $36.50 | $3.32 | **$136.65** |
| **2029** | 1.5% on $136.65M | $0.00 | $0.00 | **$138.70** |
| **2030** | 1.5% on $138.70M | $0.00 | $0.00 | **$140.78** |

### **3. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)**

**Margin Justification:**

*   **Gross Margin:** As a REIT, CHCT's primary expense after revenue is property operating expense (which is often covered by the tenant in triple-net leases, but not always). For simplicity, since the core business is owning/leasing real estate, I will focus on the Net Income Margin relative to the base year.
*   **Path to Profitability:** The TTM Net Income is -$11.39M due to non-recurring reserves and credit losses and high interest expense. A large portion of the expenses are fixed (Depreciation and Interest Expense). As revenue grows through new, high-yield acquisitions, Net Income should turn positive quickly.
    *   **Pre-Acquisition Base Net Income Margin:** TTM Net Loss of -$11.39M on $115.79M Revenue = **-9.84% margin**.
    *   **Projected Net Income Margin:** I will conservatively assume that by 2025, the company stabilizes its core operations to a **3.0% Net Income Margin** on existing base business. This is a very conservative margin for a REIT but reflects the TTM struggles and the need to turn a profit. The *incremental* net income from the new 9.1% yielding acquisitions is assumed to have a **20.0% Net Income Margin** (reflecting the additional fixed costs of running a larger portfolio, but still highly accretive).

**ROIC Assumption:**
The instruction requires applying an ROIC to net income to get additional income. For a capital-intensive REIT whose growth is driven by outside funding, the best proxy for the return on retained cash/capital is the expected return on their *new investments*.
*   **ROIC (on retained earnings):** Conservative 5.0%. This is significantly lower than their 9.1% acquisition cap rate to reflect the dividend payout and the challenge of deploying small amounts of retained income efficiently compared to large debt/equity raises for acquisitions.

**Net Income Calculation:**

| Year | Total Revenue ($M) | Base Net Income (3.0% on Prev. Rev) ($M) | Incremental Acquisition Revenue ($M) | Acquisition Net Income (20.0% Margin) ($M) | Total Operating Net Income ($M) | ROIC on Prior Year Cash ($M) | Total Net Income ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $115.79 | - | - | - | - | - | -$11.39 |
| **2025** | $120.85 | $3.47 | $3.32 | $0.66 | **$4.13** | $0.00 | **$4.13** |
| **2026** | $125.99 | $3.63 | $3.32 | $0.66 | **$4.30** | $0.21 | **$4.51** |
| **2027** | $131.25 | $3.80 | $3.32 | $0.66 | **$4.46** | $0.23 | **$4.69** |
| **2028** | $136.65 | $3.96 | $3.32 | $0.66 | **$4.63** | $0.24 | **$4.87** |
| **2029** | $138.70 | $4.10 | $0.00 | $0.00 | **$4.10** | $0.24 | **$4.34** |
| **2030** | $140.78 | $4.16 | $0.00 | $0.00 | **$4.16** | $0.22 | **$4.38** |

*Note: Cash for ROIC is accumulated Net Income from previous years, starting with the 2025 Net Income. The negative 2024 NI is not retained cash.*

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

**Assumption Justification:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative (but reasonable) rate of **10.0%** is used. This is higher than most peers' WACC to account for the company's recent GAAP unprofitability and current high-interest rate environment.
*   **Terminal Maturity Rate (g):** A very conservative, long-term growth rate of **1.0%** is used. This is lower than inflation and lower than the assumed 1.5% organic rent growth, reflecting long-term business maturation and risk.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (Year 2030):**

TV = [2030 Net Income * (1 + g)] / (Discount Rate - g)
TV = [$4.38M * (1 + 0.01)] / (0.10 - 0.01)
TV = $4.42M / 0.09
**TV = $49.11 million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year (t) | Net Income ($M) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^t) | NPV of Net Income ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $4.13 | 0.9091 | $3.75 |
| **2026** | $4.51 | 0.8264 | $3.73 |
| **2027** | $4.69 | 0.7513 | $3.52 |
| **2028** | $4.87 | 0.6830 | $3.33 |
| **2029** | $4.34 | 0.6209 | $2.69 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | $4.38 | 0.5645 | $2.47 |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | $49.11 | 0.5645 | $27.75 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | - | - | **$47.24 million** |

### **5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

| Calculation Component | Value ($M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows (NPV) | $47.24 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $3.38 |
| Subtract: Total Debt | ($534.20) |
| **Fair Equity Value** | **($483.58)** |
| Shares Outstanding | 28.471M |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **-$16.98** |

---

### **6. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: -$16.98**

**Current Market Price: ~$17.15**

The calculated fair value is **negative** at **-$16.98** per share, suggesting that according to this conservative DCF model using GAAP Net Income, the company's liabilities (debt) significantly outweigh the present value of its projected future profitability and current cash holdings.

**Justification for Disparity between Fair Value and Market Price:**

The stark difference between the negative calculated fair value and the market price of ~$17.15 is primarily due to the fundamental accounting difference between Net Income (GAAP) and the core profitability metric used by the market for REITs, which is **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)**.

1.  **Net Income vs. AFFO (The REIT Problem):**
    *   **Valuation Model:** The model uses **Net Income**, which deducts substantial, non-cash charges like **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**, and is also heavily penalized by **Interest Expense** (which has risen significantly in the current environment). A TTM Net Loss of -$11.39M on a GAAP basis confirms the company's unsuitability for a traditional Net Income DCF model.
    *   **Market View:** The market values REITs based on their cash flow available for distribution, which is AFFO. The Q3 2025 earnings show a different picture under the market's preferred metric. The TTM AFFO is a much higher positive figure, as D&A (which is a large expense for a real estate owner) is added back, and other adjustments are made. The market is pricing the stock based on its strong, distributable cash flow (AFFO) and dividend yield, not on its GAAP profitability.
2.  **Conservative Projections:**
    *   The model assumes a very conservative long-term **ROIC of 5.0%** and an ultra-conservative **terminal growth rate of 1.0%**. The market assumes a higher, more positive outlook on long-term growth and capital deployment.
    *   The model also assumes the *new* acquisition funding comes from the debt and is captured in the Debt balance, which is why the NPV is so low relative to the massive debt. The REIT business model relies on continually raising debt and equity to purchase properties, which keeps the total debt high but is accretive to AFFO.

**Conclusion on Assumptions:**
My assumption is too conservative because it adheres strictly to the instruction to use **Net Income**, which for a capital-intensive REIT like CHCT, is not the appropriate proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity. The market's positive valuation of $17.15 suggests the collective market believes the company's **AFFO** will continue to cover its dividend and grow, creating significant equity value that is completely missed when using the GAAP Net Income line item for valuation. The high level of debt required to fund their growth engine is the primary factor leading to a negative valuation in a standard Net Income DCF.
