## Business Summary

Constellation Brands primarily makes money by importing and selling premium alcoholic beverages, with their core business centered on distributing high-growth Mexican beer brands (such as Modelo and Corona) exclusively across the United States. While the company also produces wines and spirits, the majority of their revenue growth comes from this premium beer segment. Their customer base consists of adult US consumers who seek out well-known imported brands, and the company sells its products through vast networks of distributors, grocery stores, and restaurants (a B2B distribution model). This business model relies heavily on maintaining strong brand recognition and exclusive importation rights.

## Business Model Risk

The primary short-term risks relate to supply chain stability and inflation. Since the company relies heavily on production and importation from Mexico, any trade tariffs, border disruptions, or rising costs for materials like aluminum and glass can directly reduce their operating profits. A near-term concern is also consumer spending; if the US economy slows, customers might switch from expensive premium imported beer to cheaper domestic alternatives, harming sales. A major long-term threat is changing consumer preferences, which is a constant historical concern in the alcohol industry. If consumers permanently shift away from traditional beer and wine toward newer categories (like cannabis-infused drinks or non-alcoholic options, as seen with past shifts toward hard seltzers), Constellation Brands’ market position could suffer significantly. Furthermore, the business is highly dependent on the continued popularity of only a few key beer brands; a competitive challenge to Modelo or Corona could severely harm market share and earnings.

## Company History

This history lesson will guide you through the journey of Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ) from its humble origins to its current status as a major global beverage company.

### The Inception and Early Years (1945–1980s)

1.  **The Founding and Original Goal (1945):** The company was founded by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York under the name **Canandaigua Industries**. His initial goal was to solve an inconsistency in the supply of bulk wine in the post-World War II era, starting with the production and sale of bulk wine to bottlers.
2.  **Early Focus and Growth:** The company started small, selling approximately 200,000 gallons of wine in its first year. It focused on producing and marketing affordable wines, expanding in the following decades by introducing its own popular brands, like *Richard’s Wild Irish Rose*.
3.  **Going Public and Name Changes:** The company was formally incorporated in 1972 as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc., and became a publicly traded company on the stock market in 1973.

### The Transformative Expansion Era (1990s–2012)

4.  **Expansion into Spirits and Global Vision:** In the 1990s, the company began to grow rapidly through acquisitions, notably buying Barton Incorporated in 1993, which expanded its business into the spirits category. In 2000, it officially changed its name to **Constellation Brands, Inc.** to reflect its vision as a global company with a wide range of products.
5.  **A Shift to Premium Wine:** Throughout the early 2000s, Constellation made several large-scale acquisitions, including the famous *Robert Mondavi* wine company for \$1 billion in 2004, marking a strategic shift toward more premium, higher-priced wine brands.
6.  **Early Beer Footprint:** Constellation had already secured a key business, having obtained the U.S. distribution rights for the Mexican beer brand *Corona Extra* and other Grupo Modelo beers in 1986. This early relationship would later become the core of the entire company.

### The Game-Changing Windfall (2013)

7.  **The Unexpected "Tailwind" (The Beer Deal):** The single most transformative event was an enormous stroke of luck that turned into a huge competitive advantage. When the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI), attempted to take full control of Grupo Modelo (the owner of Corona and Modelo), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an **anti-trust lawsuit**.
8.  **The Innovative Solution (Forced Divestiture):** To resolve the lawsuit, the DOJ forced ABI to sell **all** of Modelo's U.S. business to Constellation Brands, including the perpetual rights to import and sell all Modelo brands (like Corona and Modelo Especial) in the U.S., along with a major brewery in Mexico (Piedras Negras). This created a fully independent competitor in the U.S. beer market.
9.  **The New Focus:** This deal for the U.S. beer portfolio made the beer segment the company’s most important, highest-growth, and highest-margin business, completely reshaping Constellation Brands overnight.

### Headwinds and New Strategy (Present Day)

10. **Headwind: A Costly Misstep (Craft Beer):** A major problem the company faced was a failed attempt to diversify its beer business with the $\$1$ billion acquisition of craft brewer **Ballast Point** in 2015. The market changed, the brand struggled under Constellation’s national strategy, and the company was forced to sell it four years later for a tiny fraction of the original price, recording massive financial write-downs.
11. **Solution: Doubling Down on the Core Strength:** Learning from this, Constellation's strategy became extremely focused on the **"higher-end"** or **"premium"** segment of the market, particularly the booming Mexican import beer business. The company is now investing heavily (billions of dollars) to build and expand its breweries in Mexico to keep up with the overwhelming demand for brands like Modelo Especial and Corona.
12. **Headwind & Solution: Repositioning Wine & Spirits:** Constellation's traditional wine and spirits division became a lower-growth, lower-margin problem area. The company's solution was a multi-year strategy called **"premiumization"**, which involved selling off most of its mass-market brands (like Woodbridge and others to E. & J. Gallo) and focusing only on high-end brands like *Robert Mondavi Winery* and *The Prisoner Wine Company*.
13. **Current Goal:** Today, Constellation Brands' ultimate goal is to be a leader in the premium beverage alcohol market, with the majority of its profits and growth driven by its Mexican beer portfolio. Its strategy is to constantly reshape its business to align with **consumer-led premiumization trends** across all categories, ensuring its products are priced higher than competitors and offer strong growth.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ) is primarily built on the unparalleled strength and cultural significance of its flagship imported beer brands, which command a premium price and foster deep customer loyalty.

### **Analysis of the Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Dominant Brand Portfolio and Market Leadership:** Constellation Brands possesses the perpetual, exclusive right to import, market, and sell the high-growth Mexican beer portfolio, including **Modelo Especial** and **Corona Extra**, in the U.S. market. This exclusivity locks out its largest global competitors from selling these high-demand brands in the world's most profitable beer market.

2.  **Special Market Position and Pricing Power (The "Premiumization" Strategy):** The company is the undisputed leader in the high-end imported beer segment, with Modelo Especial becoming the \#1 beer in the U.S. by dollar sales. This brand power and consumer loyalty allow STZ to maintain strong and sustainable **pricing power**, enabling it to consistently raise prices (targeting 1–2% pricing growth) without losing significant volume, which supports its high profit margins.

3.  **High Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The customer base for brands like Corona and Modelo shows high **brand loyalty**, which is a key competitive advantage in the consumable goods industry. This loyalty, especially among young (Gen Z) and Hispanic consumers, ensures purchases are highly sticky and naturally recurring, as beverage alcohol is a staple good.

4.  **Barriers to Entry (Superior Distribution and Infrastructure):** Constellation Brands operates with durable cost advantages and a **superior distribution network**, making it a "supplier of choice" to wholesalers and retailers. Furthermore, its continuous investment in new, cost-efficient brewery capacity in Mexico (like the Mexicali brewery) creates a significant capital and logistical barrier for any new entrant, including a competitor with more capital, to replicate this scale and supply chain.

5.  **Reason for Growth (Focus on Premium/High-End):** The company grew into what it is today by relentlessly pursuing a **"premiumization" strategy**, which involves focusing resources on higher-growth, higher-margin brands and shedding lower-margin parts of the wine and spirits business. This strategic focus allows them to capture a disproportionate share of the profit pool in the rapidly growing high-end alcohol categories.

### **Moat Reinforcement and Innovation**

1.  **Investment in Brand Equity (Marketing Moat):** STZ spends significant capital on **marketing and advertising** to build a strong brand presence and cultural relevance, a key tactic in the consumer packaged goods industry. This consistent investment helps to solidify the brand's place in the consumer's mind and maintain its market share.

2.  **Required Innovation and R&D Investment:** The company must and does invest heavily in **consumer-led innovation** to stay ahead of changing tastes (e.g., the rise of hard seltzers, ready-to-drink beverages, and no-alcohol options). Over a period, they have invested nearly **\$550 million in R&D and technical capabilities** to develop new product extensions (like Corona Premier or Corona Sunbrew) that meet evolving consumer preferences.

3.  **Network Effects and Operational Advantage:** While not a classic "network effect," the market-leading position and highly coveted portfolio make Constellation Brands an essential partner in the three-tier alcohol distribution system, creating a powerful, defensible **distribution advantage**. Furthermore, a multi-year restructuring program aims to achieve over **\$200 million in annual cost savings** to enhance operational efficiency and protect profit margins from inflationary pressures.

## Catalyst Analysis

Constellation Brands (STZ) catalysts are primarily centered around the robust performance of its high-end beer portfolio and the strategic transformation of its wine and spirits division.

## Catalysts for Stock Price Increase

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 1-2 Quarters)

1.  **Beer Business Market Share Gains:** The continued strength of the imported beer portfolio, including Modelo Especial and Corona, is the most important near-term driver. Management explicitly states that the beer business is the key growth driver and is expected to deliver strong volume growth.

2.  **Easing of Consumer Headwinds:** Management has noted that macroeconomic pressures and subdued consumer spending, particularly among the Hispanic demographic, have been a headwind. A stabilization or improvement in consumer sentiment would immediately spark volume stabilization and a stock price rebound.

3.  **Innovation Success:** The continued strong performance and market adoption of new products, such as Modelo Oro and Corona Sunbrew, are providing incremental sales growth and strengthening market share, which can lead to near-term revenue beats.

4.  **Operational Efficiency and Margin Protection:** The company is focused on managing costs and achieving operational efficiencies, which management expects will continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins (targeting 39% to 40% for the beer business) despite inflationary and tariff pressures.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 1 Year)

1.  **Completion of Wine & Spirits Portfolio Transformation:** The strategic divestiture of lower-margin, mainstream wine brands is largely complete, shifting the focus to higher-growth, higher-margin wine and spirits brands. Management views this as a multi-year strategy to reposition the business for accelerated growth.

2.  **Realization of Cost Savings:** The organizational review and divestiture activities in the Wine and Spirits segment are anticipated to deliver net annualized cost savings in excess of \$200 million by fiscal year 2028. This will drive future profit growth and improve overall enterprise margins.

3.  **Long-Term Beer Infrastructure and Capacity:** Continued investment in the Mexican brewery network allows the company to meet growing consumer demand for its beer brands. This is a long-term capital expenditure plan designed to sustain high volume growth.

4.  **Sustained Capital Allocation to Shareholders:** The company continues to pay a quarterly dividend and execute on its share repurchase program, which supports the stock price and reflects management's confidence in future cash generation.

## Management Record

The management of Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ) is led by a team with deep industry experience, focused on premiumization and disciplined capital allocation.

### **Current Management: Bill Newlands (CEO)**

1.  **CEO and Background:** Bill Newlands assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer in March 2019, succeeding Rob Sands. Newlands has a long history in the beverage alcohol industry, having held senior leadership roles at Beam Inc., LVMH Chandon Estates, and Allied Domecq Wines USA before joining Constellation Brands as Chief Growth Officer in 2015.
2.  **Reputation and Popularity:** Newlands and his team are viewed favorably by major investors like Elliott Management, who believe the management is the "right leaders with the right strategy" to deliver significant shareholder value. However, the company and its executives have faced a federal securities class-action lawsuit alleging they provided misleading information about the positive outlook for the Wine & Spirits division.
3.  **Key Decisions & Track Record:** Under his leadership, Constellation Brands was named the fastest-growing large CPG company for multiple years due to the strength of its core beer portfolio. A core strategy has been "premiumization," focusing on higher-growth, higher-margin products and strategically divesting non-core wine and spirits assets to refine the portfolio.

### **Delivery on Promises & Shareholder Value**

4.  **Financial Performance:** The management has delivered strong results in the high-end beer segment, with Modelo Especial becoming the top dollar sales beer brand and the Beer Division consistently achieving high margins. Performance has enabled the company to generate record cash flow, which is then used to reduce debt and deliver cash returns to shareholders.
5.  **Capital Allocation:** Management reinforces a disciplined capital allocation strategy, prioritizing strengthening the balance sheet, investing in organic growth (especially brewing capacity), and returning significant cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, including a recent $2 billion authorization.
6.  **Delivering on Growth:** The Beer Division's success, with strong volume growth for brands like Modelo Especial, Corona, and Pacifico, demonstrates management's ability to execute its core strategy even amid broader industry and socioeconomic headwinds.

### **Future Strategy and Vision**

7.  **Core Strategy:** The future strategy is focused on driving sustained, strong profitable growth through its iconic high-end portfolio, consumer-led innovation, disciplined capital allocation, and advancing its ESG commitments. This includes leveraging innovation into new areas like non-alcoholic beverages, such as Corona Non-Alcoholic, which was a top growth driver in its segment.
8.  **Medium-Term Financial Targets:** The management team has set a medium-term target of delivering low double-digit diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth (excluding the Canopy investment) and expects to generate a cumulative $10-$12 billion in free cash flow from Fiscal Year 2024 to 2028.
9.  **Segment Outlook:** The Beer Business is targeted for best-in-class ~7-9% annual net sales growth, while the Wine & Spirits business, following portfolio optimization, is expected to see sequential improvement toward ~1-3% net sales growth.

### **Previous Management and Transition**

10. **The Sands Family Legacy:** The company was founded by Marvin Sands, and his sons, Richard Sands (CEO 1993-2007) and Rob Sands (CEO 2007-2019), led the company through its major transformation. Their leadership was responsible for the pivotal acquisition of the Mexican beer business, which established Constellation as the largest beer import company in the U.S.
11. **CEO Change:** Rob Sands stepped down as CEO in March 2019 in a planned transition, passing the reins to Bill Newlands, an insider who had spent several years in key leadership roles. Rob Sands remained involved as Executive Chair, focusing on strategic priorities like the company's major investment in Canopy Growth Corporation (cannabis).

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Constellation Brands, Inc.'s (STZ) definitive proxy statements (DEF 14A), here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

Constellation Brands' management has a **strong incentive to act in the long-term interest of shareholders**, primarily driven by a compensation structure heavily weighted toward equity awards that use performance metrics aligned with shareholder value creation, and a significant, collective insider ownership stake.

---

### **1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **Significant Collective Ownership:** The beneficial ownership of all executive officers and directors as a group (19 persons) is approximately **11.9%** of the outstanding Class A Stock, which is a significant stake and provides a strong alignment with long-term shareholder returns.
*   **Post-Reclassification Governance:** The company transitioned in November 2022 by eliminating the prior "high-vote/low-vote" structure controlled by the founding Sands family, moving to a single class of voting common stock. This change is considered a major positive governance enhancement that equalizes voting power among shareholders.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Executive officers and directors are prohibited by the company's policy from pledging company stock, which prevents risky financial behavior like using shares as collateral for loans that could force a sale in a market downturn.

### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

*   **Incentive-Heavy Pay Mix:** The compensation structure for Named Executive Officers (NEOs), including the CEO, is heavily weighted towards performance-based incentives, with a low proportion allocated to fixed base salary (e.g., the CEO's salary is roughly 9.3% of total compensation). This design ensures pay-at-risk.
*   **Balanced Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The long-term incentive program for NEOs consists of a mix of three types of equity awards:
    *   **Performance Share Units (PSUs):** These awards have a three-year vesting period and pay out based on the achievement of specific pre-established **financial or operational metrics, and market conditions** (Total Shareholder Return-based goals).
    *   **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):** These awards generally vest over a period of time, promoting executive retention.
    *   **Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs):** These grants reward stock price appreciation over the life of the option.
*   **Performance-Based Payouts:** The PSUs, a key component of the LTI, have a payout range of 0% to 200% of the target award, ensuring that the reward is directly tied to the level of company performance against pre-set goals.
*   **High Shareholder Support:** The executive compensation program consistently receives overwhelming support from stockholders, with an average "Say on Pay" advisory vote approval of approximately **93.7%** over the past five years.

## Price History

Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ) has recently experienced significant volatility, trading near multi-year lows before staging a modest recovery following its latest earnings report.

### **Price History and Technical Analysis**

1.  **Current Proximity to 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **7.65%** above its 52-week low of $131.20 (based on a recent price of $141.24).
2.  **Trading Low Based on Technicals:** The stock appears to be trading low from a historical and technical perspective, having hit a price below $132 in late September 2025, a level not seen since the March 2020 COVID market crash.
3.  **Moving Average Comparison:** The current price is trading well below its 50-day moving average ($150.78) and its 200-day moving average ($168.07), which generally indicates a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term.
4.  **Technical Rating Mix:** Technical analysis indicators from sources like TradingView offer a mixed signal, with Moving Averages giving a "strong sell" rating, while oscillators generally remain "neutral."

---

### **Major Price Movements and Explanations**

1.  **Significant Recent Drop (Big Drop):** The stock price fell dramatically and hit its 5-year low primarily in late September 2025. This was triggered by the company cutting its full-year fiscal 2026 profit guidance.
2.  **Reason for the Drop:** The guidance cut was attributed to challenges in its Beer segment, including **weak consumer demand** and a notable decline in the purchase of high-end beer brands, such as Modelo Especial, among Hispanic consumers.
3.  **Recent Recovery (Up Bigly):** The stock staged a modest recovery of about 8% from its late-September low following its Q2 2026 earnings release in early October 2025.
4.  **Reason for the Recovery:** The price increase was due to the company reporting **better-than-expected adjusted earnings per share (EPS)** and an increase in gross margin, suggesting improved cost management and profitability despite a revenue miss and a lowered *GAAP* profit outlook.
5.  **Long-Term Valuation:** Analysts currently have a consensus price target that is significantly above the current price, suggesting that many see the stock as undervalued following the recent sell-off, with the potential for a recovery driven by anticipated cost savings and a turnaround in the Wine & Spirits business.

## Long Thesis

Constellation Brands (STZ) is a unique and protected powerhouse in the alcohol industry, poised for long-term growth and high profitability. The core argument for buying STZ is its exclusive and perpetual ownership of the fastest-growing imported Mexican beer brands in the United States, specifically Modelo and Corona. This legal exclusivity acts as a massive competitive shield, allowing STZ to dominate the lucrative high-end beer market. The company’s strategy is simple: double down on what works. Since Modelo Especial is now the top-selling beer in the US by dollar sales, STZ enjoys strong loyalty and the ability to consistently raise prices (pricing power) without losing customers. This results in superior profit margins and huge amounts of cash flow. In the short term, this cash is being invested in building new breweries in Mexico to ensure they can keep up with demand. In the long term, this excess cash is returned to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Furthermore, the company is simplifying its less profitable wine and spirits division by selling off cheap brands, focusing only on premium labels. This cleanup effort will remove a historical drag on the business, leading to higher overall company profits and efficiency over the next few years.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several critical assumptions: 1. **Consumer Loyalty Holds:** US consumers must continue to strongly prefer and pay a premium for imported Mexican lagers like Modelo and Corona over domestic light beers, seltzers, and other new categories. 2. **Economic Rebound:** The recent slowdown in consumer spending, particularly among key demographics, must stabilize and reverse, ensuring volume sales growth continues its strong trajectory. 3. **Successful Execution:** Management must successfully execute its massive, multi-billion dollar plan to expand brewing capacity in Mexico to prevent future supply shortages. 4. **Wine Division Turns Around:** The company must successfully transition its streamlined wine portfolio to generate stable, albeit slower, growth and higher margins, rather than continuing to be a distraction.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Constellation Brands (STZ) is compelling but presents a highly optimistic view that minimizes significant financial, operational, and macroeconomic risks. The core fault lies in assuming the extraordinary historical growth trajectory and premium pricing power will continue without major friction and that the long-promised fix to the Wine & Spirits division is imminent.

Here is a critique and bear case thesis based on corroborating facts:

### **Critique and Faults in the Bull Case Thesis**

1.  **The Beer Engine’s Volume is Decelerating Due to Macroeconomic Headwinds.**
    *   While Modelo and Corona remain top brands by dollar sales with strong brand loyalty, the company has explicitly acknowledged challenges with **sales volume growth** and a recent decline in shipment volumes. This suggests the ability to "double down on what works" is running into real-world consumer caution and a soft market, which directly contradicts the assumption that volume sales growth continues its strong trajectory.

2.  **Pricing Power is Being Offset by Internal and External Costs, Pressuring Margins.**
    *   The thesis touts "superior profit margins" from pricing power, but Constellation Brands is currently facing significant **margin pressures** due to fixed costs from its extensive brewery network, incremental tariffs, and an increase in marketing investments needed to maintain its competitive edge. This friction indicates that not all price increases are flowing directly to the bottom line without increased corresponding expenses.

3.  **The Wine & Spirits "Cleanup Effort" is a Massive and Persistent Financial Drag.**
    *   The transition is not simply removing a historical drag; it is causing a severe near-term hit to the financials. The company has recognized a non-cash **goodwill impairment loss** of up to **\$2.5 billion** on the Wine and Spirits business, and the segment's net sales have recently seen a decline of 65% due to divestitures. The division's operating income is still projected to decline in the near-term, indicating the turnaround is delayed and the division remains a major liability and distraction.

4.  **The "Successful Execution" of Capacity Expansion Carries Significant Capital Risk.**
    *   The massive multi-billion dollar plan to build new breweries is necessary but has a history of high-profile failure and political risk, as demonstrated by the **cancellation of the Mexicali plant** which resulted in a **\$666 million impairment charge**. The long-term success relies on uninterrupted execution, and the huge, sustained capital expenditure can limit free cash flow available for "excess cash" shareholder returns (buybacks and dividends) in the short-to-medium term.

### **Bear Case Thesis for Constellation Brands (STZ)**

The Constellation Brands long thesis masks a capital-intensive, two-speed business where the powerful beer engine is showing signs of sputtering volume in the face of economic uncertainty, while the underperforming non-beer business is an ongoing financial drain.

1.  **Decelerating Beer Volume Growth and Margin Headwinds:** The beer segment's extraordinary growth is slowing down as macroeconomic pressures cause consumer caution and a dip in sales volume, particularly among key demographics. The company is forced to absorb margin headwinds from tariffs and necessary high fixed costs, which dilutes the benefit of its celebrated pricing power and makes hitting growth targets increasingly difficult.
2.  **Delayed and Costly Wine & Spirits Turnaround:** The supposed "cleanup" of the Wine & Spirits portfolio has resulted in a massive, multi-billion dollar non-cash impairment charge and large declines in net sales, confirming the segment is a substantial anchor on overall company profitability. The promised "higher growth and higher margins" from the premium-focused portfolio are still years away (projected beyond Fiscal 2026), meaning the drag will persist.
3.  **Capital Allocation and Execution Risk:** The company is currently consuming significant capital on a massive brewery expansion project in Mexico, a process that has already been subject to political and environmental setbacks and multi-hundred-million-dollar write-offs in the past. This prolonged high capital expenditure reduces near-term free cash flow, which could limit the highly anticipated share buybacks and pressure the valuation multiple that is predicated on its long-term growth story and pristine capital structure.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the next logical steps should focus on quantifying the financial aspects and validating the key macroeconomic assumptions that underpin both your bull and bear cases.

Here are the important questions still left unanswered and next steps to investigate, using the provided search results to guide the focus:

### **I. Quantify the Valuation and Financial Health**

1.  **Valuation Context:** Determine if the stock is truly "trading low" by comparing current valuation multiples against historical averages and peers.
    *   The current **EV/EBITDA is around 9.1x to 9.7x**, which is significantly lower than its 5-year median of around 15.1x to 15.7x and the industry median of 11.3x. This suggests a potentially undervalued stock, but requires competitor analysis to confirm.
2.  **Returns on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Confirm that the massive capital expenditure (CapEx) is creating shareholder value, which is the core tenet of the growth thesis.
    *   The latest **ROIC of approximately 10.9% to 16.5%** is greater than the estimated Cost of Capital (WACC of ~5.69%), indicating the company is generating excess returns and creating value. Further investigation should focus on how the new CapEx spending affects the *incremental* ROIC (which was negative recently, suggesting a potential short-term drag).
3.  **Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Risk:** Quantify the financial risk posed by the brewery expansion program cited in the bear case.
    *   The search indicates a Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately **2.9x to 3.5x**, which is considered manageable for a company with stable cash flows, but you need the **specific forward CapEx guidance (in billions)** for Fiscal Years 2026/2027 to measure the actual near-term pressure on Free Cash Flow (FCF).

### **II. Deep Dive into Core Business & Macroeconomic Headwinds**

4.  **Beer Volume Deceleration:** Determine the current severity and cause of the reported slowdown in the core beer business.
    *   Recent data shows the overall US beer volume declined (-3.6%), while **Super-premium beer grew by 4%** in volume, suggesting Constellation's category is still strong, though the *rate* of growth might be slowing. The next step is to find **Modelo-specific** volume and depletion trends from the latest quarter to see if they are recovering from the noted "Hispanic consumer" slowdown.
5.  **Competitive Threat in Imports/Premium:** Identify who is gaining traction at the expense of Mexican imports, as noted in the bear case.
    *   Market trends from 2025 show that **Guinness (Irish Stout) and Japanese imports** are gaining share in certain on-premise markets, suggesting shifts in high-end consumer preference and a need to monitor these direct category competitors more closely.

### **III. Confirm Wine & Spirits (W&S) Turnaround**

6.  **Premium W&S Growth Validation:** The W&S turnaround is a major long-term catalyst and a bear case liability; you need concrete segment-level data.
    *   The portfolio is now entirely focused on brands priced **\$$15 and above** (e.g., Robert Mondavi, The Prisoner Wine Company) following divestitures completed in mid-2025. The next step is to find the **latest quarterly organic net sales and margin data** specifically for this *retained* premium portfolio to prove the turnaround is actually stabilizing or accelerating growth, rather than just being smaller.
