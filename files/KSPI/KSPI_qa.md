## Business Summary

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz operates primarily in Kazakhstan and serves a majority of the country's adult population through a single integrated platform, often referred to as a "Super App." The company has three interconnected segments. First, it runs a dominant Payments platform, allowing users to transfer money instantly and pay bills. This platform generates large amounts of user data and encourages high usage frequency. Second, it is a major Fintech operator, deriving its largest source of revenue from granting high-margin consumer loans and offering other financial products. Third, it hosts a popular e-commerce Marketplace, which acts as a digital middleman for local merchants selling goods to consumers. The core business model relies on attracting users with the low-cost Payments platform, then using the frequent engagement data to cross-sell profitable consumer loans and facilitate marketplace shopping, maximizing the value of each customer within its closed ecosystem.

## Business Model Risk

KSPI faces significant concentration risk because nearly all its earnings are generated within Kazakhstan. Any near-term political instability or sudden regulatory changes, such as the government imposing new caps on the interest rates the company can charge for consumer loans, could immediately and severely impact its most profitable segment. A critical long-term risk is credit default risk. The company relies heavily on income from lending, and if the Kazakh economy suffers a downturn (driven by factors like commodity price volatility or high local inflation), a large number of borrowers could fail to repay their debts. Although the company uses advanced credit scoring, emerging markets are inherently volatile. Historically, companies reliant on consumer finance in emerging economies have suffered sharp earnings declines following economic shocks, confirming that credit quality risk remains a primary threat to Kaspi.kz’s financial stability and market position.

## Company History

The history of Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (KSPI) is a unique story of transforming a traditional bank in Kazakhstan into a leading technology and "Super App" company.

### 1. Inception and The Founding Purpose

1.  **Humble Beginnings (2002):** The foundation of Kaspi.kz started with Vyacheslav Kim, who was a successful electronics retailer in Kazakhstan.
2.  **The Original Problem and Idea:** To boost sales at his electronics store, Kim needed a way to offer credit to his customers, as the consumer credit market was underdeveloped. This led him to acquire a small, privatized bank called **Kaspiyskiy Bank** in 2002, with the initial goal of essentially running a financial arm for his retail business.
3.  **A Pivotal Partnership (2007-2008):** After facing early challenges in the complex banking world, Kim partnered with the Baring Vostok fund. This led to Mikheil Lomtadze joining as CEO in 2007. The company was rebranded simply as **Kaspi** in 2008.
4.  **The New Mission:** The founders pivoted from a traditional, inefficient bank to a mission of creating a genuinely **customer-centric financial institution**. Their goal was to use technology to provide easy, convenient, and accessible digital financial services to the mass consumer market in Kazakhstan.

### 2. Problems (Headwinds) and Solutions (Innovative Milestones)

| Challenge/Headwind | Year/Period | Innovative Solution/Tailwind |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lack of Public Trust** | **2014** | A bank run, fueled by misinformation, made management realize that people fundamentally distrusted the traditional banking system. |
| **Solution: Building Trust Through Technology:** Management made a decisive and transparent response to the crisis. They focused on building a secure, user-friendly digital platform and moved all their services online to prove reliability and earn customer trust. |
| **Traditional Banking Inefficiency** | **Mid-2010s** | Traditional banks in the region were bureaucratic and failed to meet the public's need for simple, quick services. |
| **Solution: The 'Super App' Model (2017):** Kaspi launched an all-in-one mobile application—the **Kaspi.kz Super App**. This single app brought together all their services (payments, shopping, loans) to create a seamless, one-stop-shop digital experience. |
| **Low Digital Payment Adoption** | **Pre-2014** | Before the Super App, electronic payments accounted for only a small percentage (around 13%) of all transactions in Kazakhstan. |
| **Solution: Integrated Payment Ecosystem:** They introduced services like: **Kaspi Gold** (a popular debit card), **P2P (peer-to-peer) money transfers**, and **Kaspi QR** (in-store payments using a QR code). This created a powerful network effect that rapidly drove digital payment adoption. |
| **Connecting Buyers and Sellers** | **Ongoing** | Merchants needed easy ways to accept payments, and consumers needed a reliable place to shop and access credit. |
| **Solution: The Two-Sided Ecosystem:** Kaspi developed two apps: the **Kaspi.kz Super App** for consumers and the **Kaspi Pay Super App** for merchants. This allowed them to manage a single, interconnected platform for payments, e-commerce, and financing. They also innovated with Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services like **Kaspi Red**, offering interest-free installments on their marketplace. |
| **The Pandemic and Economic Headwinds** | **2020 - Present** | The COVID-19 pandemic brought global economic uncertainty, and today the company faces the risk of being too heavily tied to the local Kazakh economy and managing inflation. |
| **Solution: Digital Acceleration & Expansion:** The pandemic served as a major **tailwind**, as their digital solutions allowed users to manage all finances and shopping securely from home, leading to a massive surge in users and profits. The company is now actively expanding internationally, notably with the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Turkish e-commerce platform Hepsiburada. |

### 3. Present Day and Future Goal

1.  **Current Status:** Kaspi.kz has become a dominant force in Kazakhstan, with over two-thirds of the country’s population using their Super App in some form. It is now one of the most valuable public companies to come out of Kazakhstan.
2.  **The Business Model:** The company operates on three main platforms that reinforce each other: **Payments** (transaction fees, transfers), **Marketplace** (e-commerce commissions), and **Fintech** (consumer loans and deposits).
3.  **Going Public:** The company successfully listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2020 and, more recently, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 2024, securing its position on the global financial stage.
4.  **A Unique Partnership: GovTech:** A non-revenue generating, yet crucial, part of the Super App is its integration with government services (GovTech). This allows users to pay taxes, renew driver's licenses, and access digital ID documents, which drives high user engagement and frequency on the app.
5.  **The Goal:** With its domestic market largely penetrated, the company's long-term ambition is to expand beyond Kazakhstan, replicate its successful Super App model in new markets, and grow its user base to **100 million users**.

## Moat Analysis

Kaspi.kz's competitive advantage, or "moat," is fundamentally built on its unique two-sided **Super App ecosystem** that seamlessly integrates three core platforms: Payments, Marketplace, and Fintech, creating a self-reinforcing loop.

### 1. The Core Moat: The Super App Ecosystem and Network Effects

*   **Integrated Super App Model:** Kaspi.kz's primary moat is its all-in-one mobile application for consumers and a separate one for merchants, which combines everyday services like payments, e-commerce, and financial products into a single, high-engagement platform.
*   **Powerful Network Effects:** The integrated model creates a powerful "flywheel" effect: more consumers use the app for payments and services, which attracts more merchants to the Marketplace and payment network; in turn, more merchants and product offerings attract even more consumers.
*   **Dual-Sided Marketplace:** The company's unique advantage is serving both consumers and merchants with interconnected, proprietary Super Apps, which is a key differentiator from rivals that typically focus on a single service.

### 2. Differentiation and Market Position

*   **Market Dominance in Payments:** Kaspi.kz operates a widely adopted proprietary payment network, handling a majority of all payment network transactions in Kazakhstan, giving it a dominant position in the country's digital economy.
*   **Embedded in Daily Life (High Stickiness):** The app is not just for one-off purchases; its services, like commission-free peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and bill payments, make it a daily utility. Active users have an exceptionally high level of engagement, with an average of over 70 monthly transactions per consumer.
*   **Proprietary Logistics:** The company has invested in its own fulfillment and delivery network, including its own network of **Kaspi Postomats** (parcel lockers), which provides a competitive advantage in logistics and customer experience for the Marketplace.

### 3. Pricing Power and Sticky/Recurring Revenue

*   **Low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** The Payments platform, particularly free P2P transfers, acts as a low-cost customer acquisition engine. Once acquired, customers can be cross-sold to higher-margin services like the Marketplace and Fintech platforms, which significantly reduces the cost of getting a user to try new products.
*   **Pricing Power through Value-Added Services (VAS):** While basic payment services might be low-margin or free to drive volume, Kaspi.kz increases its overall "take-rate" (revenue percentage from transactions) through value-added merchant services like advertising, delivery, and logistics.
*   **Recurring and Sticky Contracts:** The high frequency of use, high retention rates (which were 92% in 2018), and the reliance of merchants on the platform for sales and financing ensure that the customer and merchant relationships are highly sticky and revenue is recurring, not just one-time.

### 4. Defense Against Capital and Path to Dominance

*   **Difficulty of Displacement (Capital):** A competitor with more capital would struggle to displace Kaspi.kz because its moat is not just financial, but **operational and psychological**. To compete, a rival would need to simultaneously build a ubiquitous payment network, a large-scale e-commerce marketplace, and a regulated, data-rich fintech lender, all within a single application that customers trust for their daily needs.
*   **The Reason for Growth:** The company's success stems from its strategic pivot from a traditional bank to a customer-centric, digitally-focused retail platform, focusing on a superb user experience (simple, reliable, fast). This customer focus allowed it to win mass market adoption and capture high market shares early on.
*   **Culture of Innovation and R&D:** Kaspi.kz dedicates significant resources to innovation, including establishing a new innovation lab and fostering a culture of rapid development, hypothesis testing, and quick Minimum Viable Product (MVP) releases, which ensures it stays ahead of the curve and constantly improves the ecosystem.
*   **Need for Constant Innovation:** Yes, the company must constantly innovate. It has done so by continually adding new verticals (e-Grocery, e-Cars, Travel) to address more of its users' daily needs, thereby increasing the value and stickiness of the Super App and strengthening the moat.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of the management incentive and compensation for Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (KSPI) is based on the company's public filings, primarily its Form 20-F equivalent for foreign private issuers.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **High Insider Ownership for Co-Founders:** The company's co-founders, including CEO Mikheil Lomtadze and Chairman Vyacheslav Kim, retain a substantial collective equity stake, which aligns their personal long-term financial interests directly with the company's share price performance. The high level of insider ownership (around 38% for insiders as of June 2025) suggests a foundational incentive to maximize shareholder value.

2.  **Compensation Structure Components:** Executive compensation for managers and directors primarily consists of a base salary, an annual cash bonus, and long-term equity incentives in the form of share-based awards. The total compensation paid to all executive officers and board members for the year ended December 31, 2024, was ₸2,254 million.

3.  **Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Structure:** The company operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) adopted in 2020, which grants nominal-cost options to key employees and directors. These options are a "line their own pockets" incentive *only* if the stock price rises, thereby tying the award's value directly to shareholder returns over time.

4.  **Vesting Conditions (Time-Based):** The options granted under the LTIP typically vest in five equal annual installments, with the sole condition for vesting being the recipient's continued employment or service. This *time-based* vesting structure is primarily a retention tool and does not explicitly tie the grant to performance metrics like Total Shareholder Return (TSR), Revenue, or Net Income growth.

5.  **Annual Bonus Structure:** Executive officers are eligible for annual bonuses under their employment agreements, and employees may participate in incentive programs linked to the performance of specific business units. While the existence of these short-term incentives is noted, the precise performance metrics (e.g., specific financial targets) for these cash bonuses are not explicitly disclosed in the summarized public filings.

### **Conclusion on Alignment**

**Conclusion: Kaspi.kz's management has a very strong, primary incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders, driven by their massive personal equity holdings, which supersedes the formal compensation structure.**

*   **Incentivized to Act in Shareholder Interest (High Alignment):** The co-founders' wealth is inextricably linked to the company’s stock price through their substantial ownership stake (approximately 38% for insiders). The sheer magnitude of their personal equity holdings means they have the greatest incentive to drive long-term stock appreciation for all shareholders.
*   **Formal Plan Focuses on Retention (Moderate Alignment):** The formal LTIP, which utilizes time-vesting options, is structured mainly for retention of a broader group of key personnel. While the *value* of the options depends on share price growth, the lack of explicit performance hurdles is a less rigorous form of incentive alignment compared to performance-share units.
*   **Risk of "Lining Own Pockets" (Low Risk):** The primary risk of managers "lining their own pockets" through excessive cash compensation is mitigated by the dominant role of equity and the co-founders' majority stake, ensuring that decisions are first and foremost equity-value-driven.

## Price History

Based on the most recent available data and technical analysis:

1.  **52-Week Range and Current Price:** The stock trades as an American Depositary Share (ADS) on the NASDAQ under the ticker KSPI. The 52-week range is from a low of **$75.90** to a high of **$116.84**. The last quoted price is approximately in the range of $84.00 - $84.38, for calculation purposes we will use the prior close of **$84.38**.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **11.17%** above its 52-week low of $75.90. (Calculation: $(\$84.38 - \$75.90) / \$75.90 \times 100\% = 11.17\%$).

3.  **Technical Analysis Assessment:** From a technical perspective, the stock is showing "Sell" or "Strong Sell" signals across multiple timeframes, with its price below key short-term and long-term moving averages (8-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs/EMAs). This indicates that the current price is *low* relative to its recent short-term and medium-term trends and is exhibiting downward momentum.

4.  **Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) Reading:** The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the low-to-mid 40s (e.g., 40.2 or 41.882), which is below the midpoint of 50, but **not** in the traditional "oversold" territory (typically below 30). Therefore, while the stock is trending down, it is not yet technically signaling an immediate bounce as a result of being oversold.

5.  **Recent Price Declines:** Over the last year, the stock has been down by approximately 19.32%, and over the last six months, it has declined by roughly 10.88%, indicating a significant downward trend from its highs.

6.  **Reasons for Drops (Last Few Months):** The stock's performance has been hampered by specific events, including management lowering its full-year guidance following a **Q1 2025 earnings miss**. The Q1 miss was partially attributed to a temporary issue related to a smartphone registration requirement, and a major financial institution also **downgraded the stock** from "Overweight" to "Neutral" in August 2025.

7.  **Positive Fundamentals Amid Weakness:** Despite the recent share price weakness, the company has reported strong Q2 results with robust revenue growth, and it is considered by some analysts to be a long-term growth story with a low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and a high dividend yield.

## Long Thesis

Kaspi.kz holds an almost unbreakable market dominance in Kazakhstan because its "Super App" combines everyday payments, shopping, and lending into one platform. This creates a powerful network effect where every user activity increases the value of the ecosystem, leading to very high customer engagement and low acquisition costs. In the near term, the company will grow profits significantly by selling more high-margin services (like delivery and advertising) to its massive, active user base and by improving efficiency in its lending division. The biggest future upside is its long-term plan to successfully export this proven Super App modelbeginning in Turkeyto other emerging markets, transforming the company from a domestic leader into a global, multi-region financial technology giant aiming for 100 million users.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The Kazakh government must maintain current business-friendly regulations, particularly concerning consumer loan interest rates, allowing the company's highly profitable lending business to continue. The local economy must remain stable enough that Kaspi's customers do not face massive loan defaults, which would severely hurt earnings. Crucially, management must successfully prove that its "Super App" business model can be replicated and scaled effectively in international markets, such as Turkey, generating profits similar to those seen at home.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the holes and faults in the bullish thesis for Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (KSPI) by challenging its core assumptions using corroborating, up-to-date market and regulatory data.

## Critique and Bear Case Thesis for Kaspi.kz (KSPI)

The long thesis is flawed primarily because it assumes the stability of the high-margin domestic lending environment and oversimplifies the enormous challenge of replicating the Super App model in a mature, competitive foreign market.

### Flaws in the Long Thesis

#### 1. Unstable Regulatory Environment for High-Margin Lending (Challenge to Assumption 1)
*   **Direct Regulatory Intervention:** The core assumption of "business-friendly regulations" for lending is actively being dismantled. Kazakhstan's financial regulators have introduced new, lower caps on the Annual Effective Interest Rate (AEIR) for various loans, including reducing the maximum AEIR for unsecured bank loans from 56% to a hard cap of 46% and setting limits for microloans.
*   **Credit Growth Curbing Measures:** New legislative amendments are explicitly aimed at "cooling down consumer lending," which will directly restrict the growth of Kaspi's highly profitable Fintech division. Measures include banning loans to citizens with over 90 days of overdue debt and introducing a "Stop Credit" option for individuals.
*   **Impact on Profitability:** Kaspi's high growth and margin rely significantly on its consumer lending. These new interest rate caps and stricter lending criteria directly pressure the net interest margin (NIM) and limit the total addressable market (TAM) of its highest-risk, highest-return customers, threatening to lower future profit growth rates.

#### 2. International Expansion Risk is Understated and Capital Intensive (Challenge to Assumption 3)
*   **Hepsiburada Turnaround is Risky:** The long-term plan to "successfully export this proven Super App model" is significantly hampered by the acquisition of Turkey’s Hepsiburada. The initial evidence shows challenges, including a decline in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and deteriorating free cash flow for the acquired entity.
*   **Greater Competition in Turkey:** The Turkish market is described as "wildly different from Kazakhstan" and having "a heck of a lot more competition" compared to Kaspi’s dominant position at home. Replicating the domestic "network effect" is not guaranteed and requires heavy, unproven investment against established regional and global players.
*   **Capital Strain and Dividend Suspension:** To fund this high-risk expansion, Kaspi's board has proposed halting annual dividend payments. This dividend suspension is a tangible cost to shareholders and signals the significant capital allocation needed for the Turkey gamble, which may not yield immediate or Kazakhstan-level profits.

#### 3. **Domestic Dominance Is Nearing Saturation and Competition Exists (Challenge to Thesis Claim)**
*   **Saturation Point:** While Kaspi.kz has a dominating position—with around 75% of the Kazakh population using the Super App and a commanding share of e-commerce and fintech—future growth from the domestic market faces natural deceleration simply because the company has claimed so much of the total addressable market (TAM).
*   **Growing External Competition:** The market, while dominated by Kaspi, is not an unbreakable monopoly. Global and regional competitors like Alibaba, Wildberries, and Ozon are cited as key players in the Kazakh e-commerce ecosystem, creating a genuine threat to market share, particularly as the e-commerce sector continues to mature.
*   **Margin Erosion from New Services:** The push to sell "more high-margin services (like delivery and advertising)" comes with an inherent risk of group margin dilution, as expanding into businesses like e-Grocery (which is structurally lower-margin) may slow net income growth, even if overall revenue remains high.

***

## Bear Case Thesis

The bear case for Kaspi.kz centers on the **critical degradation of its highly profitable domestic lending segment due to regulatory intervention** coinciding with **high-risk, capital-intensive international expansion with uncertain returns.**

1.  **Regulatory Crackdown on Profitability:** Government-imposed caps on consumer loan interest rates and new, stricter borrower requirements in Kazakhstan will severely compress margins and constrain the growth of the company's most profitable Fintech segment, directly undercutting the thesis of growing high-margin services.
2.  **High-Risk, Unproven International Replication:** The attempt to export the Super App model to a more complex and competitive market like Turkey via the acquisition of Hepsiburada introduces significant integration, execution, and financial risk. Initial performance challenges (GMV decline, cash flow deterioration) suggest the replication model is not "proven" and will require prolonged, heavy capital investment, evidenced by the company's dividend suspension.
3.  **Domestic Growth Deceleration:** With Kaspi’s super-dominant market share in a country with only 20 million people, domestic growth, which funds the international expansion, is destined to slow down. Future incremental gains will come from lower-margin services (e-Grocery) or increasingly competitive market segments where local and foreign rivals are present.
4.  **Macroeconomic and Credit Risk:** The rapidly soaring consumer debt in Kazakhstan, combined with the government's attempts to "cool down" the market, points to elevated systemic credit risk. A significant economic downturn in the local economy could lead to a massive wave of loan defaults, severely crippling the earnings of the core Fintech segment, which is now facing tighter regulatory controls.

## Next Steps

The analysis you have completed is thorough and successfully identifies the key pillars of both the Bull and Bear cases (Kazakhstan's domestic profitability and Turkey's international execution risk). The recent Q2 2025 data you found already addresses many initial concerns.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate, primarily focused on quantifying the risks and validating the international growth strategy:

### **1. Quantifying the Regulatory Headwind in Kazakhstan**

*   **Immediate Impact of New Loan Rate Caps:** Search for any follow-up commentary from Kaspi.kz management (post-Q2 2025) or analyst reports that **quantify the expected impact of the new 46% Annual Effective Interest Rate (AEIR) cap** on the company's Fintech Net Interest Margin (NIM) for the second half of 2025. The current Q2 data only reflects higher *deposit costs*, not the new *lending revenue* cap which directly pressures profitability.
*   **Credit Quality Projections:** Investigate if management has updated its expected loss rates or provisioning for the Fintech segment in light of the new, tighter lending criteria (like the ban on loans to citizens with over 90 days of overdue debt). The core credit risk remains a major bear case element.

### **2. De-risking the Turkey/Hepsiburada Expansion**

*   **Super App Integration Milestones:** Search for the **specific, near-term execution plan** for integrating the three Super App pillars (Payments, Fintech, Marketplace) into Hepsiburada. This means looking for a timeline on the rollout of Kaspi's high-margin products, such as **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** lending and the **Kaspi Pay merchant solution**, on the Hepsiburada platform.
*   **Hepsiburada Free Cash Flow Trend:** Find the latest details on Hepsiburada’s Free Cash Flow (FCF) or cash burn rate. The Q2 results noted an increase in net loss; further investigation is needed to understand the precise capital drain required to turn it profitable and fund the $300 million investment.
*   **CEO's New International Management Structure:** Kaspi's success is tied to its core management team. Investigate **who is leading the Turkey Super App replication effort** on the ground and what their track record is, as this is a new, complex challenge that requires management's direct attention.

### **3. Validating the "Unbreakable Moat" Against Competition**

*   **Quantifying E-commerce Market Share:** Search for recent (2024 or 2025) **market share data for e-commerce in Kazakhstan** for key competitors like **Alibaba (AliExpress), Wildberries, and Ozon** relative to Kaspi's Marketplace. This data is essential to directly counter the Bull thesis's claim of "almost unbreakable market dominance" and quantify the real competitive threat.
*   **Comparative Take-Rate Analysis:** Investigate if analysts have published comparative reports on Kaspi’s Marketplace take-rate (currently around 10.2% in Q2 2025) versus the take-rates of its major international competitors in the region. This will help determine if Kaspi's value-added services (advertising, delivery) are truly translating into sustainable **pricing power**.
