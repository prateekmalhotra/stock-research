## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Future Financial Projections

Loews Corporation is a diversified holding company. The revenue and net income projections must be based on the outlook and management commentary for its key subsidiaries: CNA Financial (Insurance), Boardwalk Pipelines (Energy Midstream), and Loews Hotels & Co. The "net income goes straight into cash for the next year" methodology will be applied, where Net Income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) to the firm/equity.

### **A. Business Engine Assumptions**

| Segment | Historical Performance (Q3 2025) | Future Assumption & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CNA Financial (Insurance)** | Net Earned Premiums up 8%. Combined Ratio 92.8%. Catastrophe losses significantly down. Unfavorable reserve development noted. | **Conservative Growth (1.0% - 2.0%):** I assume a conservative, steady growth in net earned premiums, which is a key revenue component. The 8% growth is likely cyclical (low catastrophe losses) and offset by reserve issues. I assume 2.0% in 2025-2026 (based on momentum) and a reversion to 1.0% long-term, reflecting a mature P&C market. |
| **Boardwalk Pipelines (Energy)** | Net Income up 22%. Announced $3.0B of growth projects (4.2 Bcf/d capacity) with long-term (15+ yr) contracts and double-digit ROA. $19.8B in estimated future revenues. | **Project-Driven Growth (5.0% - 3.0%):** The management's announced $3.0B in projects provides a clear, contracted revenue stream. I project a 5.0% revenue bump over 2025-2027 as projects come online, then a reversion to a 3.0% steady-state (faster than CNA, reflecting infrastructure demand) from 2028-2030, which is still conservative given the magnitude of the contracted future revenue. |
| **Loews Hotels & Co (Hospitality)** | Results improved due to new properties (Universal Orlando) and strong convention center performance. | **Post-Launch Growth (3.0% - 1.5%):** The benefit from the recent three new properties in Orlando is factored in. I assume a 3.0% growth rate in 2025-2026, then revert to a highly conservative 1.5% long-term rate for the mature hospitality business. |
| **Corporate/Other** | Decreased due to lower investment income. | **Static/Nominal:** I will assume a $0.00$ billion contribution to consolidated revenue (lumping the income/loss into the Net Income Margin) as it is primarily a non-core investment portfolio. |

### **B. Revenue Projections (in millions USD)**

The YTD 9-month revenue for 2025 was $13.72$ billion. Using the Q3 to Q4 relationship for the past two years, I project a full year 2025 revenue of $\sim\$18.3$ billion.

| Year | Growth Rate (Conservative) | Projected Revenue | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Est. Full Year) | - | $18,300$ | Extrapolation from $13.72B$ YTD 9-month revenue. |
| **2026** | 3.5% | $18,941$ | Blended rate reflecting momentum in CNA and initial project ramp-up at Boardwalk. |
| **2027** | 3.0% | $19,510$ | Continuing Boardwalk's project-driven growth and steady CNA/Hotels performance. |
| **2028** | 2.5% | $19,998$ | Boardwalk growth moderates as major projects are online. |
| **2029** | 2.0% | $20,398$ | Reversion toward long-term mature conglomerate growth rate. |
| **2030** | 1.5% | $20,704$ | Final conservative, low-growth assumption for terminal year. |

### **C. Net Income Projections & ROIC Calculation**

**Margin Assumptions:**
*   **Historical Net Income Attributable to Loews (YTD Sept 30, 2025):** $1.27$ billion on $13.72$ billion revenue, implying a 9.26% margin.
*   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** I will use a **7.5%** Net Income Margin for the forecast period. This is a conservative reduction from the 9.26% YTD 2025 margin to account for volatility in the P&C insurance business (catastrophe and reserve development risk) and lower investment income at the corporate level.

**ROIC Assumption:**
*   **Net Income for Next Year Formula:** Net Income(t) = (Revenue(t) * Margin) + (Net Income(t-1) * ROIC%)
*   **ROIC Assumption:** Loews is a long-term capital allocator. A look at the business segments shows long-life, double-digit ROA assets (Boardwalk projects). CNA is a capital-intensive insurance business with a lower ROIC. I will use a **conservative 5.0% ROIC** on the *cash* generated by the previous year's net income, reflecting the low-risk nature of their investment philosophy and the return on their capital allocation. If past ROIC was negative, a conservative positive ROIC is justified here as the company is profitable.

| Year | Projected Revenue (M) | Net Income (t-1) (M) | ROIC (5.0%) Income (M) | Base Net Income (M) (7.5% Margin) | Projected Net Income (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $18,300$ | N/A | N/A | $1,373$ | $1,373$ |
| **2026** | $18,941$ | $1,373$ | $69$ | $1,421$ | $1,490$ |
| **2027** | $19,510$ | $1,490$ | $75$ | $1,463$ | $1,538$ |
| **2028** | $19,998$ | $1,538$ | $77$ | $1,500$ | $1,577$ |
| **2029** | $20,398$ | $1,577$ | $79$ | $1,530$ | $1,609$ |
| **2030** | $20,704$ | $1,609$ | $80$ | $1,553$ | $1,633$ |

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### **A. Discount Rate & Terminal Value Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** I will use a **9.0%** discount rate. This is conservative for a diversified conglomerate with significant, stable, regulated utility-like assets (Boardwalk) and a major insurance arm (CNA), which often command lower discount rates. However, its conglomerate structure and the inherent risk in P&C insurance justifies a rate slightly above a typical market average.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth):** I will assume a **2.0%** terminal growth rate. This is a very conservative assumption for a mature, diversified holding company operating in stable, non-cyclical industries (insurance, midstream energy, hospitality). This reflects a long-term growth rate slightly above inflation.

### **B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

**Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
$$ \text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} $$
$$ \text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$1,633 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$1,666}{0.07} = \$23,800 \text{ million} $$

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (1/1.09^t) | NPV (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=0.5) | $1,373$ | $0.957$ | $1,314$ |
| **2026** (t=1.5) | $1,490$ | $0.914$ | $1,363$ |
| **2027** (t=2.5) | $1,538$ | $0.873$ | $1,343$ |
| **2028** (t=3.5) | $1,577$ | $0.834$ | $1,315$ |
| **2029** (t=4.5) | $1,609$ | $0.798$ | $1,284$ |
| **2030** (t=5.5) | $1,633$ | $0.763$ | $1,246$ |
| **Terminal Value** (2030) | $23,800$ | $0.763$ | $18,165$ |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$26,030 \text{ million}$** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Net Present Value (NPV) | $26,030$ |
| **ADD:** Total Cash & Equivalents (Parent Company) | $3,600$ |
| **LESS:** Total Consolidated Debt | $9,443$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | $26,030 + 3,600 - 9,443 = \$20,187 \text{ million}$ |
| **Shares Outstanding** (in millions) | $206.66$ |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\$20,187 / 206.66 = \mathbf{\$97.68}$ |

---

## 5. Justification and Conclusion

### **Fair Value Summary**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share (L)** | **$97.68** |
| **Current Market Price per Share (L)** | **$\sim\$102.59$** |
| **Difference** | $\mathbf{-\$4.91}$ |
| **Undervalued/Overvalued** | **$4.8\%$ Overvalued by the Market** |

### **Justification for Market Divergence**

The calculated intrinsic fair value of **\$97.68** is approximately 4.8% lower than the market price of $\sim\$102.59$. The market is making slightly more optimistic assumptions than my conservative valuation model.

The market's assumptions for Loews are likely more aggressive in two key areas:

1.  **Higher Growth Rate in Core Segments:** The market is likely pricing in a more significant ramp-up in the highly-contracted Boardwalk Pipelines division and a stronger continuation of the insurance underwriting cycle at CNA.
    *   *My conservative assumption:* Assumed blended revenue growth that tails off to 1.5% in 2030.
    *   *Market's likely assumption:* May project a higher long-term growth rate, possibly in the $2.5\% - 3.0\%$ range, reflecting the $19.8$ billion in estimated future revenues from Boardwalk's performance obligations, which are essentially locked-in growth.

2.  **Higher Net Income Margin:** The market is likely factoring in the current strong performance of the CNA combined ratio (92.8% in Q3 2025) and projecting that the high interest rate environment will continue to benefit the net investment income of the insurance arm.
    *   *My conservative assumption:* Used a 7.5% net income margin to cushion for P&C reserve volatility and the inevitable downturn in the underwriting cycle.
    *   *Market's likely assumption:* May project a margin closer to the YTD 9.26% figure, or even higher, believing management can sustain an excellent combined ratio and high investment returns.

Given the deeply conservative nature of the assumptions (7.5% margin, 5.0% ROIC, and 9.0% discount rate for stable assets), the fair value of $\mathbf{\$97.68}$ is a floor. The market is pricing in modest optimism, but the divergence is not significant enough to call the stock drastically mispriced. The intrinsic value is within a tight band of the current market price.
