## Business Summary

Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is the massive, state-controlled utility responsible for almost all aspects of electricity supply within South Korea. Its core business model is simple: it generates electricity by consuming imported fuels (like coal, natural gas, and uranium for nuclear power), transmits this power across high-voltage wires nationwide, and then distributes it directly to customers. KEPCO's revenue comes entirely from these electricity sales. Customers are exclusively located in South Korea and include every residential household and, most significantly, the vast industrial sector (factories, manufacturers, and large corporations) that consumes the majority of the nation's power. Since KEPCO operates under heavy government control, it functions more as an essential public service than a typical corporation, with its prices strictly regulated by the state.

## Business Model Risk

KEPCO faces two major interconnected risks. The most pressing near-term risk involves the cost-revenue imbalance: KEPCO must purchase nearly all its fuel sources from volatile global markets, but the price it is allowed to charge customers for electricity is fixed by the government. When global fuel prices surge, as they did dramatically in 2022, KEPCO’s operating costs balloon, but regulatory intervention often delays necessary price hikes to protect the public. This has historically caused KEPCO to run massive operating losses and accumulate enormous corporate debt, severely weakening its financial stability. The critical long-term risk is the energy transition. South Korea is committed to decarbonization, requiring KEPCO to phase out its major fossil fuel assets (like coal plants). This requires the company to invest huge sums into building renewable infrastructure and upgrading the national grid. Failure to manage this transition effectively could result in its current power plants becoming economically worthless ('stranded assets'), harming the company's long-term market position and earnings.

## A Jargon-Free History of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO)

The story of KEPCO, which operates as a critical national utility, is closely linked to the history of modern South Korea itself, particularly its rapid transformation from a developing nation to a global economic powerhouse.

### I. The Inception and Founding Purpose

1.  **Early Beginnings (1898):** The history of electricity in Korea dates back to 1898 with the founding of the Hansung (Seoul) Electric Company. It was established with a personal investment from King Gojong of the Korean Empire, who wanted to bring modern services like electric lights and streetcars to the capital.
2.  **A Fragmented System:** Over the next few decades, the electric power industry became fragmented under colonial rule and after World War II, with multiple separate companies operating in the South. This lack of a unified system meant the power supply was unstable and inefficient.
3.  **The Official Founding (1961):** The modern company, originally called the Korea Electric Company (KECO), was officially established on July 1, 1961. The government forced a merger of the three existing electric companies to consolidate all power generation, transmission, and distribution under a single national entity.
4.  **The Mission: Powering the Nation's Growth:** The primary goal was to provide a stable, standardized, and reliable electricity supply across South Korea. This was crucial for the government's ambitious national economic development plans, which were heavily focused on building new industries and rapidly modernizing the country.

### II. The Era of National Electrification (1960s - 1980s)

5.  **A Key Turn: The Nuclear Solution:** To secure enough power for its booming industries and to reduce the nation's reliance on expensive, imported oil and coal, KEPCO made a strategic decision to invest heavily in **nuclear power** starting in the 1960s. This move was a massive, innovative solution that provided a stable, large-scale energy source.
6.  **National Powerhouse:** In 1982, KECO became a wholly government-owned entity and was renamed the **Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO)**. This officially cemented its role as the sole, state-controlled utility responsible for national electrification.

### III. Headwinds and Restructuring (1990s - 2000s)

7.  **The Monopoly Problem (Headwind):** By the late 1990s, KEPCO's absolute monopoly was seen as a barrier to efficiency and competition. Like many state-owned monopolies around the world, there was a feeling that it needed market pressure to become more innovative and cost-effective.
8.  **The Innovative Solution (Restructuring):** In 2001, the government initiated a major restructuring. KEPCO's power generation assets were spun off into **six separate, independent power generation companies** (GENCOs). KEPCO retained control over the core business of **transmission and distribution** (the power lines and billing) but had to buy electricity from these new, competing generating companies.
9.  **Going Global:** To diversify its business and revenue, KEPCO began actively pursuing **overseas power projects**. This strategy allowed the company to leverage its technical expertise in new markets, turning it into a global utility player.

### IV. Modern Challenges and Financial Crises (2020s to Present)

10. **The Perfect Storm (Headwind):** A massive financial crisis hit KEPCO from 2021 to 2023. As a public utility, the electricity rates it could charge to consumers were set by the government (a regulated pricing system). When global prices for fuel like natural gas and coal surged dramatically (due to events like the Russia-Ukraine war), KEPCO's cost to generate electricity skyrocketed.
11. **The Core Problem:** KEPCO had to buy expensive fuel on the global market, but the government did not allow it to raise consumer electricity rates fast enough to cover those costs. This created a huge gap, leading to its largest-ever operating losses—a massive **headwind** from government regulation and geopolitical events.
12. **Solutions and Financial Recovery:** To address the mounting debt, KEPCO took drastic measures (self-rescue plan). This included selling off real estate and overseas assets, implementing strict budget cuts, and working with the government to eventually raise industrial and residential electricity rates.
13. **The Current Tailwinds:** As global fuel prices stabilized and the rate hikes took effect, KEPCO has returned to profitability for several consecutive quarters. A future **tailwind** is the booming demand for energy from new data centers and the AI industry in South Korea, which will guarantee significant demand for electricity.

### V. KEPCO's Goal Today

14. **Dual Mission:** Today, KEPCO's goal remains two-fold: to maintain its monopoly on the **transmission and distribution** of electricity, ensuring reliable power to every customer in South Korea, and to secure its position as the nation's dominant generator through its subsidiaries.
15. **A Green Energy Transition:** KEPCO's main challenge for the future is the global shift toward cleaner energy. The company is actively working to transition its energy mix by increasing its capacity for **renewable energy** (solar and wind) and continuing to rely on its established **nuclear power** infrastructure, aiming to meet national carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

## Moat Analysis

The primary moat of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is a powerful, government-granted vertical monopoly over the national electricity grid, which makes it nearly impossible for any competitor to displace it.

Here is a breakdown of KEPCO's unique advantages and market position:

### The Moat: Legal and Infrastructure Monopoly

1.  **Statutory Monopoly over the Grid:** KEPCO's core and strongest moat is its legal status as the exclusive operator of the entire power **transmission, distribution, and sales** network in South Korea. This means that while other companies can generate electricity (competition exists in the *generation* market), they must use KEPCO's infrastructure to deliver and sell that power to consumers.
2.  **Unrivaled Infrastructure Network Effect:** The national grid represents an enormous, multi-decade investment of sunk capital that covers the entire country. This established network is a classic, insurmountable barrier to entry; no private competitor could ever justify the cost of building a parallel, nationwide transmission and distribution system.
3.  **Government Ownership and Support:** The company is a market-based public corporation with a majority stake (over 51%) held by the South Korean government and the state-owned Korea Development Bank. This deep partnership ensures government support, which was the fundamental reason it grew into the national giant it is today and provides a strong layer of stability and security.

### Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Displacement

4.  **Difference from Competitors:** Its competitors are primarily Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and KEPCO's own six power generation subsidiaries, which must compete in the electricity generation market. The key difference is that no competitor has the right to distribute and sell power directly to the public through the national wires; KEPCO is the sole entity connecting all producers to all consumers.
5.  **Regulated Pricing Power:** KEPCO does not have independent pricing power. Electricity tariffs (the price it can charge customers) are subject to government approval and regulation. This means that while it is a monopoly, it is a **price-taker** in the market it sells to, and if raw material (fuel) costs spike, its profitability can be severely impacted until the government approves a rate increase.
6.  **Displacement Difficulty:** It is virtually impossible for someone with more capital to displace KEPCO in its core business. The displacement would require not just massive capital but also a complete overhaul of South Korea's energy laws to allow a competing national grid, a scenario with extremely high political and regulatory barriers.

### Customer Stickiness and Innovation

7.  **Sticky and Recurring Customers:** Electricity is an essential, non-discretionary service, making its customer base entirely sticky and recurring. All businesses and households in the country are, by definition, recurring customers who depend on KEPCO for their power supply.
8.  **Strategic R&D and Innovation:** KEPCO and its subsidiaries continually invest in R&D to maintain a technological edge and align with national goals. Their focus areas include advanced nuclear technology (like Small Modular Reactors or SMRs), clean hydrogen, smart grid modernization, and digital transformation.
9.  **Maintaining the Moat through Future Investment:** The company is actively working to solidify its moat by focusing on areas aligned with the government's "Net Zero 2050" mandate, such as renewable energy integration. This ensures the regulated utility remains at the forefront of national energy policy, making its infrastructure indispensable for the future energy mix. Constant innovation in these areas is crucial, not just to maintain a business edge, but to meet national strategic energy goals, further cementing its role as the national utility.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEP) can be categorized into factors that could drive the stock price in the near-term (next 12-18 months) and long-term (multiple years).

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12–18 Months)**

1.  **Return to Profitability:** Analysts generally forecast KEP to transition from a net loss in the previous fiscal year (FY 2023) to a positive net profit (EPS) for the full fiscal year 2024, marking a significant earnings turnaround.
2.  **Increased Nuclear Power Generation:** The new **Shin Kori Unit 5 nuclear power plant** is expected to start commercial operations in October 2024, which management projects will increase the overall contribution of nuclear power for the full year.
3.  **Dividend Re-Initiation:** Based on the improved financial outlook and recent management comments, there is a high probability that the company will resume dividend payments for the current fiscal year, which is typically a strong signal for investors.
4.  **Lower Fuel Costs:** A reduction in fuel costs, specifically the cost of coal and power purchases, contributed to a significant drop in the cost of sales in Q1 2025, which helps bolster the operating profit.
5.  **Electricity Rate Increase:** As a regulated utility, an approval for a much-needed increase in the electricity rate would be a substantial positive catalyst to improve KEP’s margins and financial health, counteracting past financial strain.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)**

1.  **National Energy Policy Shift to Carbon-Free:** South Korea has a national goal to increase the share of carbon-free energy sources, including nuclear and renewables, from about 40% to a future target of **70%** of the country's electricity supply.
2.  **Expansion of Nuclear and Renewable Capacity:** KEP is targeting a significant increase in its renewable and nuclear power capacity by **+33% in 2024**, with further substantial increases planned for 2025 and 2026.
3.  **Growth in Overseas Business:** The company continues to secure new international contracts, such as major power deals in Saudi Arabia, which helps diversify revenue streams and contributes to the "Other" revenue segment.

### **Management’s Commentary and Strategy**

*   **Focus on Nuclear:** Management explicitly stated in their Q1 2025 earnings call that the decline in their coal generation mix is directly due to the **increased generation from nuclear power plants**.
*   **Capacity Expansion:** The commercial operation of the Shin Kori Unit 5 nuclear power plant is a stated strategic initiative to lift the overall nuclear power contribution for the current year.
*   **Debt Management:** Management reported in the Q1 2025 earnings call that interest expenses saw a year-on-year decrease, indicating a focus on managing the high debt burden, despite a slight increase in total consolidated borrowings.

## Management Record

The management analysis of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEP) for an investor is structured below, focusing on the current leadership, past performance, and future direction.

### **KEP Management & Leadership**

1.  **Current CEO Appointment and Political Background:** The current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President, Kim Dong-cheol, was appointed in September 2023, replacing Cheong Seung-il, who had resigned earlier that year. Kim Dong-cheol is notable as the first former politician to lead KEP in over 60 years, having served as a legislator and supported South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol.
2.  **Significance of Political Ties:** As KEP is a state-owned entity (the government holds a 51% stake) where electricity tariff rates—a primary driver of revenue and earnings—are politically sensitive and government-influenced, a CEO with a strong political background is seen as having the necessary leverage to push for meaningful tariff increases.
3.  **Overall Management Experience:** The current management team is considered relatively new, with an average tenure of approximately 1.8 years, suggesting a significant recent turnover across the leadership ranks.

### **Financial Track Record and Shareholder Value**

4.  **Recent Financial Performance:** KEP experienced a sustained period of losses at the EBIT level from the second quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by soaring global energy and fuel prices that outpaced government-regulated electricity tariffs.
5.  **Delivering Value to Shareholders (Current):** The company's recent track record has been characterized by significant losses and, consequently, a suspension or reduction of dividend payouts, which negatively impacts immediate shareholder value.
6.  **Future Value Catalysts:** Management's performance is currently judged on its ability to execute a turnaround, with analysts viewing a return to profitability and the potential reinstatement of dividends as key catalysts for increasing shareholder value. This return to profitability is heavily dependent on the management securing a meaningful electricity tariff hike and benefiting from lower global energy prices.

### **Key Decisions and Strategic Vision**

7.  **Historical Core Strategy:** Key decisions in KEP's history include the early and strategic adoption of nuclear power to provide a stable, low-fuel-cost energy source for the country's industrial growth.
8.  **Pivotal Restructuring:** A major decision in 2001 was the restructuring that spun off generation assets into six independent power generation companies (GENCOs) to introduce a degree of competition into the generation market.
9.  **New CEO's Key Strategic Goals:** CEO Kim Dong-cheol has set an explicit, investor-focused strategy centered on three core areas: securing a substantial increase in electricity tariffs, accelerating revenue diversification, and implementing cost optimization measures.
10. **Long-Term Diversification Vision:** The new management’s vision is to significantly reduce reliance on the regulated domestic utility business by aiming to generate over 30% of KEP's sales from foreign markets and new businesses in the long term, up from roughly 6% of revenue from core domestic electricity sales in the first half of 2023.
11. **Technological Investments:** Management has also focused on strategic investments in smart grid technologies to modernize the power grid, aiming to improve efficiency and reliability.

## Management Incentive

Based on the nature of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) as a public utility and a state-owned enterprise (SOE), the management's incentives are primarily aligned with the South Korean government's public policy goals rather than strictly maximizing returns for minority shareholders.

### Analysis of KEPCO's Management Incentive and Compensation

**1. Controlling Shareholder and Governance Structure**

*   **Dominant Control:** The single most important factor is that the South Korean government, directly and indirectly, owns a controlling 51.10% share of KEPCO.
*   **Public Mandate over Profit:** As a Public State-owned Enterprise, KEPCO's core mission involves national energy security and public service, meaning management's focus is on governmental policy goals (e.g., stable power supply, managing national debt/tariffs) which may sometimes conflict with increasing shareholder value.

**2. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **Low Equity Alignment:** Unlike typical publicly traded U.S. companies, KEPCO's executive management and directors are **not reported to have significant personal equity stakes** in the corporation.
*   **Conclusion on Alignment (Insider Ownership):** The "higher the better" principle for insider ownership is *not met*, as managers are civil servants or political appointees rather than major equity holders, resulting in minimal personal financial incentive tied directly to the stock price performance for minority shareholders.

**3. Compensation Structure and Incentives**

*   **Government-Regulated Compensation:** Executive compensation is subject to South Korean public institution guidelines, making the pay structure less flexible and generally less geared toward long-term equity performance compared to fully private companies.
*   **Focus on Fixed vs. Variable Pay:** Compensation for SOE executives typically consists of a high percentage of fixed salary, with variable pay (bonuses) often linked to performance metrics mandated by the government for public entities, such as operational efficiency, cost management, and achievement of public policy targets (like energy transition goals).
*   **Lack of Direct Long-Term Equity Incentive:** Given the government's controlling stake and the SOE status, there is a low probability of significant long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) like performance share units (PSUs) or large stock options that would directly tie an executive's multi-year wealth growth to the appreciation of KEPCO's minority-held stock.

### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

*   **Incentives for Public Interest:** KEPCO's management is fundamentally incentivized to act in the interest of the **controlling shareholder (the South Korean government)** and its associated public policy objectives, such as reliable power and regulated pricing.
*   **Incentives for Shareholders:** Management has **insufficient incentive to act in the sole or primary interest of *minority* shareholders** because their job security, compensation, and career progression are derived from meeting the government's mandate, not from maximizing the stock price or dividends for the 48.90% public float.
*   **Risk:** The structure incentivizes management to comply with government directives and secure stable operations, which could involve politically motivated decisions (like non-cost-reflective tariffs) that may line *government policy pockets* or simply ensure *public stability*, even if it leads to losses or depressed share value for private investors.

## Price History

Here is an analysis of the price history and technical standing for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEP).

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **95.36%** above its 52-week low of \$6.68 (using a recent price of \$13.05, as of late September 2025). The 52-week high for KEP is \$15.19.

2.  **Technical Analysis: Trading Low or High?** Technical indicators provide mixed signals, but many suggest the stock is **not trading low** based on immediate momentum.
    *   Moving Average (MA) analysis, including the MA5 to MA200, shows a "Strong Sell" outlook with 0 Buy signals and 12 Sell signals, suggesting it is trading below key long-term averages.
    *   The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.170 suggests a "Sell" signal, meaning the stock is not oversold (which would suggest it is trading low).
    *   However, some broader sentiment and long-term analysis have been "Bullish," with the stock previously breaking out of a 5-year downtrend.

3.  **Significant Price Increase (Bigly Up):** The stock has been up significantly over the past year, with a one-year return of over 63% and a nearly 95% increase in 2025 (as of the search date). The major surge around June 2025, which saw the stock hit a 7-year high, was driven by strong expectations for a **"nuclear renaissance"**. These expectations are tied to its subsidiary, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, securing potential large-scale, multi-trillion won overseas nuclear power plant orders.

4.  **Significant Price Drops/Financial Strain:** KEP has faced pressure and drops, often related to its core business and domestic price controls.
    *   The state-run utility company has significant debt (over 200 trillion won as of June) due to not being able to raise electricity prices enough to cover soaring global fuel costs.
    *   A -7.4% drop in September 2024 occurred after the company announced a freeze on electricity rates for the fourth quarter, signaling continued financial difficulties.
    *   The stock also experienced a drop of over 10% in June 2025, one of its largest single-day declines since March 2020, amidst broader market movements and utility sector sentiment.

## Long Thesis

KEP is undergoing a powerful financial and operational turnaround. In the near term, the worst of the massive financial losses are over. Global fuel costs (like coal and gas) have stabilized, and the South Korean government has finally allowed KEP to raise electricity prices, returning the company to strong profitability and likely allowing for the resumption of dividend payouts to shareholders. In the long term, the company is protected by a government-granted monopoly over the entire national electricity grid. This guarantees a highly stable stream of revenue driven by the ever-increasing power demands from South Korea's massive industrial sector and the booming AI/data center market. KEP's main growth engine will be its push toward stable, low-cost nuclear power—the key technology for the nation's clean energy goals—which both slashes KEP's operating costs domestically and provides the technical expertise necessary to win lucrative, multi-billion dollar power plant construction contracts around the globe, significantly diversifying its revenue away from politically controlled domestic rates.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on four critical assumptions: 1) Global fuel prices for gas and coal must remain stable or low, ensuring KEP's cost of generating power does not surge again. 2) The South Korean government must continue to allow KEP to charge electricity prices that accurately reflect its operating costs. 3) KEP must successfully execute its nuclear strategy, meaning the new power plants start operating on schedule and its subsidiaries successfully secure major new overseas nuclear power plant contracts. 4) Domestic industrial and technological demand (like data centers) must continue its aggressive growth trajectory, underpinning KEP's core revenue.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEP) contains several critical vulnerabilities and understates the magnitude of the company's financial and political constraints.

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

Here are the key holes and faults in the bullish argument, structured by the underlying assumptions:

### Flaws in Assumption 1 & 2: Financial Turnaround and Tariff Freedom (Near-Term)

1.  **Massive Debt Overhang Neutralizes Profitability:** While KEP has returned to an operating profit (e.g., for FY2024), its financial recovery is severely hindered by a staggering debt burden exceeding 200 trillion won as of early 2025. The annual interest expense alone is a massive financial drain (around 4.67 trillion won in 2024) that will take years of high profitability to overcome.
2.  **Dividend Resumption is Fragile and Political:** The resumption of dividend payouts for FY2024 was small and largely seen as a political signal aligned with the government's "Corporate Value-up Program." Given the colossal accumulated deficit, the long-term sustainability and size of dividends are highly questionable, as the company should prioritize debt resolution.
3.  **Political Control Over Tariffs is a Structural Barrier:** The assumption that the government will allow KEP to charge prices that "accurately reflect its operating costs" is consistently undermined by state policy. The government has repeatedly frozen **household** electricity rates to curb inflation and manage public discontent, forcing KEP to absorb costs and rely on politically sensitive, selective hikes (e.g., industrial users).
4.  **Fuel Price Stability is Not Guaranteed:** The bullish thesis relies on "stable or low" fuel prices, but market forecasts for 2025 and 2026 suggest potential upward pressure on global natural gas (LNG) prices due to factors like rising US LNG exports. Given KEP's reliance on imported fossil fuels, this re-introduces the primary risk that caused the recent massive losses.

### Flaws in Assumption 3: Nuclear Execution and Diversification (Long-Term)

5.  **Domestic Nuclear Capacity Faces Significant Delays:** The push toward "stable, low-cost nuclear power" is challenged by domestic project setbacks. New unit completion dates have been continually pushed back (e.g., Shin-Hanul 3&4 are now scheduled for 2032 and 2033 after long delays), significantly postponing the introduction of the promised low-cost power generation into KEP's mix.
6.  **Overseas Diversification is Plagued by Disputes:** The promise of winning "lucrative, multi-billion dollar" contracts is threatened by two major issues:
    *   **External IP Risk:** The finalization of the major Czech nuclear contract has been reportedly stalled due to an intellectual property (IP) dispute with the U.S. firm Westinghouse, who claims ownership over the core technology, adding significant political and legal uncertainty to KEP's nuclear exports.
    *   **Internal Financial Conflict:** KEPCO is involved in an escalating financial dispute with its own subsidiary, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), over cost overruns from the Barakah project in the UAE, which has proceeded to international arbitration. This internal conflict threatens the efficiency, unity, and financial integrity of the "Team Korea" export model.

### Flaws in Assumption 4: Demand-Side Risk

7.  **Industrial Demand Creates Costly Grid Obligations:** While data center and industrial demand is growing, the government's pursuit of RE100 (100% renewable energy) zones requires KEP to purchase renewable power, which is currently about **1.5 times more expensive** than nuclear power. KEP is also expected to fund the massive transmission infrastructure upgrades needed for these new complexes, piling new, costly, and regulated burdens onto the debt-laden company.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEP)

KEP is a government-controlled utility with a crippling debt load that faces inherent regulatory and structural risks, regardless of its operational improvements.

1.  **Debt-Driven Financial Distress:** KEP's massive 200+ trillion won debt and multi-trillion won annual interest payments create a state of permanent financial distress. Any operational profit from cost reductions is immediately consumed by servicing this legacy debt, making a meaningful financial recovery and sustainable, significant dividend resumption impossible for the foreseeable future.
2.  **Profitability is Politically Capricious:** KEP’s earnings are fundamentally constrained by the government's use of electricity tariffs as a political tool to manage inflation and public sentiment, particularly for household users. This political cap prevents the company from fully reflecting and passing on fuel cost volatility to consumers, meaning future spikes in global LNG or coal prices will immediately re-trigger large losses and negate any temporary turnaround.
3.  **Nuclear Growth is Too Slow and Risky:** The long-term growth driver of stable, low-cost nuclear power is a slow-motion catalyst. New domestic capacity is years behind schedule (with new units not expected until the early 2030s), while highly anticipated overseas contracts are facing significant execution risk due to internal disputes (KEPCO vs. KHNP) and external legal challenges (Westinghouse IP lawsuit). This delays the diversification of revenue and the internal cost savings necessary for a real financial transformation.
4.  **High-Demand Future is a High-Cost Obligation:** The booming demand from AI and data centers will not translate directly to proportional profits because it forces KEP to undertake massive, state-mandated infrastructure spending for grid expansion and expensive, politically-driven power purchasing (e.g., higher-cost domestic renewables for RE100 zones). This transforms surging industrial demand into a rising capital expenditure and operating cost burden for a company that cannot afford to borrow any more.

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis and the results of the initial investigation, here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps to investigate further.

The search results successfully clarified the status of the major nuclear export risk and provided current details on the debt and dividend situation.

### I. Critical Unanswered Questions and Next Steps

1.  **Quantify the Total Debt Burden and its True Cost**
    *   **Unanswered:** The massive debt of **over 200 trillion won** remains the primary bear case. The self-rescue plan aims to save ~20 trillion won by 2026, but the total annual interest expense is a continuous drain.
    *   **Next Step:** Investigate the specific **debt maturity schedule for 2026 and beyond**. High principal repayments could force KEPCO to issue new bonds or require a government bailout, significantly impacting its liquidity.
    *   *Search Query:* `KEPCO long-term debt maturity schedule 2026`

2.  **Determine the Sustainability of Dividends and Accumulated Deficit**
    *   **Unanswered:** KEPCO has a huge accumulated deficit of **43 trillion won** (as of mid-2024), which must be resolved before significant, sustainable dividends can be paid under Korean commercial law. The recent dividend was small and largely symbolic.
    *   **Next Step:** Research the legal or policy-mandated timeline for KEPCO to clear its accumulated deficit and the government’s explicit stance on using operating profit for debt reduction versus shareholder returns.
    *   *Search Query:* `KEPCO legal requirement accumulated deficit dividend payout South Korea`

3.  **Future Electricity Tariff Policy, Especially for Households**
    *   **Unanswered:** The most recent rate hikes were highly political and *only* targeted industrial users, while household rates were frozen to manage inflation. The long-term bull case requires household rates to become cost-reflective.
    *   **Next Step:** Search for any definitive government announcement or the draft of the **next comprehensive rate normalization plan** that includes a schedule for household tariff adjustments.
    *   *Search Query:* `South Korea next residential electricity tariff increase schedule 2026`

4.  **Quantify the Energy Transition's Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) Burden**
    *   **Unanswered:** The bear case highlights that KEPCO must fund massive grid upgrades for the energy transition and purchase expensive domestic renewable energy. This mandated spending is a cost burden on the debt-laden company.
    *   **Next Step:** Find KEPCO's projected **CAPEX budget for grid modernization/expansion** related to RE100 zones and the specific comparative cost difference between domestic renewable energy (solar/wind) and nuclear power.
    *   *Search Query:* `KEPCO grid modernization CAPEX budget 2025-2030 RE100`

### II. Update on Previous Risks (The Good News)

The initial search provided key clarity on one major long-term risk:

*   **Overseas Nuclear Export Risk (Largely De-risked):** The major **Intellectual Property (IP) dispute** with Westinghouse that threatened the Czech nuclear tender (a $17.1 billion deal) was **settled** in January 2025. This effectively clears a major hurdle for KEPCO and its subsidiary KHNP to finalize the Czech deal and actively pursue other global projects, significantly strengthening the long-term growth catalyst.
