## U-Haul Holding Company (UHAL) Stock Valuation

This valuation uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on a conservative projection of U-Haul Holding Company's (UHAL) future Net Income, guided by financial data from SEC filings and management commentary.

### Step 1: Current Financial Position (Data from SEC Filings)

The initial financial data is consolidated from the latest available filings, primarily the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (FY2025), and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2025 (FY2026 Q3).

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) | Date / Period | Rationale / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$1,032.3** | Dec 31, 2025 (FY26 Q3) | Latest cash balance reported. |
| **Total Debt** | **$8,020.0** | Dec 31, 2025 (FY26 Q3) | Total debt reported. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | **196.08 million** | May 28, 2025 | Sum of Common (19.61M) and Non-Voting (176.47M) shares. |
| **Current Stock Price (UHAL)** | **$50.24** | *Approximation* | Conservative average of recent quotes. |

**Historical Financials (In Millions USD):**

| Metric | FY 2024 (Mar 31) | FY 2025 (Mar 31) | TTM FY 2026 (Dec 31) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Revenue | $5,625.7 | $5,828.7 | $6,000.0 (Approx.) |
| Net Income | $628.7 | $367.1 | $128.6 (Approx.) |
| **Net Income Margin** | **11.18%** | **6.30%** | **2.14%** |

### Step 2: Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projection

U-Haul's core business is divided into two key segments: **Self-Moving Equipment Rental** (trucks, trailers, etc.) and **Self-Storage**. The business engine analysis must recognize the primary driver of recent earnings volatility: **fleet costs.**

**Business Engine Drivers:**

1.  **Self-Moving (Revenue Engine):** Driven by *Volume (Transactions)* and *Price (Revenue per transaction)*. The primary headwind has been **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, specifically fleet depreciation and losses on disposal of retired equipment, which management attributes to the high prices paid for trucks in the preceding 30 months.
2.  **Self-Storage/U-Box (Growth Engine):** Driven by *Net Rentable Square Feet (NRSF) added* and *Revenue per Occupied Foot*. This segment is a significant growth area, with the company aggressively expanding its footprint (6.5 million NRSF added in FY2025, plus 15.0 million NRSF in development). U-Box revenue, a key part of this, grew 8.5% in FY2025.

**Projection Assumptions (Conservative Approach):**

| Category | FY2026 (Estimate) | FY2027 - FY2030 | Rationale (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | 3.0% (from $6.0B TTM) | 2.5% per year | U-Haul's growth has been slowing. We project a moderate growth above historical averages, driven primarily by the high-growth Storage segment. The TTM revenue is approximately $6.0B. |
| **Self-Moving Segment** | Flat revenue growth | 0.5% - 1.0% growth | Assumes fleet utilization/pricing is stable but faces macroeconomic pressure. Management is reducing fleet purchases, indicating a shift away from high volume-chase at the expense of fleet quality. |
| **Self-Storage/U-Box** | 7.0% growth | 6.0% growth | Conservative reduction from the 8.0% growth seen in FY2025, reflecting potential for new NRSF to be added and filled over the forecast period. |

**Projected Revenue (In Millions USD):**

| Year | Basis | Revenue Growth | Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | *Historical* | *N/A* | *$5,828.7$* |
| **FY 2026**| $5,828.7 * (1+3.0%)$ | 3.0% | **$6,003.5** |
| **FY 2027**| $6,003.5 * (1+2.5%)$ | 2.5% | **$6,153.6** |
| **FY 2028**| $6,153.6 * (1+2.5%)$ | 2.5% | **$6,307.4** |
| **FY 2029**| $6,307.4 * (1+2.5%)$ | 2.5% | **$6,464.9** |
| **FY 2030**| $6,464.9 * (1+2.5%)$ | 2.5% | **$6,626.5** |

***

### Step 3: Margin and Net Income Projection

The company's Net Income Margin has compressed from 11.18% in FY2024 to 2.14% in TTM FY2026. This is the core issue to address in projections.

**Margin Assumptions (Conservative Return to Normalization):**

| Metric | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin** | Management expects the fleet depreciation/resale headwind to **"bottom out" in calendar year 2026** (mid-FY2027). The cost of new van acquisitions is also down 12%. This is a strong indicator of margin recovery. We will *conservatively* assume the margin recovers to a historical average but stop short of the FY2024 peak (11.18%). We project a recovery to a sustainable **7.5%** by FY2030, a mid-point between the depressed TTM and the FY2024 peak. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | The trailing normalized ROIC is 3.16%. We will use a conservative ROIC of **3.0%** to project the additional income generated by reinvesting accumulated net income (cash). |

**Projected Net Income (In Millions USD):**

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Projected NI (B) = A * NI% | Cash from Prior Year (C) | ROIC (D) = C * 3.0% | Total Net Income (B + D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $5,828.7 | *6.30%* | $367.1 | *N/A* | *N/A* | **$367.1** |
| **FY 2026**| $6,003.5 | 4.00% | $240.1 | $367.1 | $11.0 | **$251.1** |
| **FY 2027**| $6,153.6 | 5.00% | $307.7 | $251.1 | $7.5 | **$315.2** |
| **FY 2028**| $6,307.4 | 6.00% | $378.4 | $315.2 | $9.5 | **$387.9** |
| **FY 2029**| $6,464.9 | 7.00% | $452.5 | $387.9 | $11.6 | **$464.1** |
| **FY 2030**| $6,626.5 | 7.50% | $497.0 | $464.1 | $13.9 | **$510.9** |

***

### Step 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) as per the instruction ("net income for each year goes straight into cash").

| Assumptions | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (Conservative)** | **10.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate for a mature, capital-intensive business. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (Maturity Rate)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative, below-GDP long-term growth rate, suitable for a mature company. |

**Discounted Cash Flow:**

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) (Millions USD) | Discount Factor @ 10.0% | NPV of FCF (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FY 2026 | $251.1 | 0.909 | $228.3 |
| FY 2027 | $315.2 | 0.826 | $260.4 |
| FY 2028 | $387.9 | 0.751 | $291.3 |
| FY 2029 | $464.1 | 0.683 | $317.0 |
| FY 2030 | $510.9 | 0.621 | $317.3 |
| **Sum of NPV of FCFs** | | | **$1,414.3** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (based on FY2030 Net Income):**
$$Terminal\ Value = \frac{FY2030\ Net\ Income\ \times\ (1\ +\ Maturity\ Rate)}{Discount\ Rate\ -\ Maturity\ Rate}$$
$$Terminal\ Value = \frac{510.9\ \times\ (1\ +\ 0.02)}{0.10\ -\ 0.02} = \frac{521.1}{0.08} = \$6,513.8\ Million$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value:**
$$NPV\ of\ Terminal\ Value = Terminal\ Value\ \times\ Discount\ Factor\ (Year\ 2030)$$
$$NPV\ of\ Terminal\ Value = \$6,513.8\ Million\ \times\ 0.621 = **\$4,044.1\ Million**$$

**Total Equity Value (Enterprise Value) = Sum of NPV of FCFs + NPV of Terminal Value**
$$Total\ Equity\ Value = \$1,414.3\ Million\ +\ \$4,044.1\ Million = **\$5,458.4\ Million**$$

***

### Step 5: Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Equity Value (NPV of Future Cash Flows) | $5,458.4$ |
| **ADD: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,032.3$ |
| **LESS: Total Debt** | $(8,020.0)$ |
| **Calculated Fair Value of Equity** | **$(1,529.3)$** |

**Fair Value Per Share = Fair Value of Equity / Total Shares Outstanding**
$$Fair\ Value\ Per\ Share = \frac{(\$1,529.3\ Million)}{196.08\ Million\ Shares} = **(\$7.80)\ per\ share**$$

### Final Valuation and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **(\$7.80)** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **~$50.24** |

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

The negative fair value of **($7.80)** calculated using the DCF model highlights a massive discrepancy with the current market price of **$50.24**. This severe outcome is not a reflection of the company being worthless, but a direct consequence of the company's current financial structure and highly capital-intensive nature being strictly evaluated under the DCF model's constraints.

The core reasons for the negative valuation are:

1.  **Massive Total Debt Relative to Projected Net Income:** The company carries over **$8.02 billion** in debt. This debt is significantly larger than the sum of the projected discounted net incomes and current cash. In a FCFE (Net Income) based DCF model, the debt is subtracted directly from the NPV of future earnings, which in this case, completely overwhelms the projected cash flow.
2.  **Weak Proxy for FCFE:** Using Net Income as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for a capital-intensive company like U-Haul is highly conservative, as mandated by the rules. U-Haul has extremely high non-cash charges like **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**, specifically fleet depreciation.
    *   **The Market's Assumption:** The market likely values UHAL using Free Cash Flow *to the Firm* (FCFF) or adjusts FCFE by adding back the portion of D&A that exceeds capital expenditures for *maintenance* (since a large portion of their CapEx is for growth). FCF is typically much higher than Net Income for UHAL. For example, Operating Cash Flow in the nine months ended Dec 31, 2025 was **$1.39 billion**, compared to a 9-month Net Income of only $210.9 million. The market is valuing the high operating cash flow, not the depressed net income.
3.  **Conservative Margin Assumptions:** The valuation only projects a Net Income Margin recovery to a conservative 7.5%. Given the management's strong conviction that the fleet depreciation/resale losses are **bottoming out** and the cost of new equipment is falling, the market may be pricing in a much faster and more significant recovery towards the historical 11%+ margin.
4.  **Growth in Self-Storage/U-Box:** The perpetual growth rate of 2.0% is very conservative. The self-storage and U-Box segments are the company's long-term growth engines, continually adding rentable space (15.0 million NRSF in development). The market is likely applying a higher perpetual growth rate to capture the value of this long-term real estate/storage asset accumulation.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The negative fair value is a technical result of strictly applying a conservative FCFE model (Net Income as FCFE) to a company with a very high debt load and massive non-cash charges (D&A). The market is clearly making a different, more optimistic assumption: that U-Haul's true **Free Cash Flow** (which is significantly higher than Net Income) will be sufficient to support its debt and that margins will recover robustly as fleet-related headwinds subside.

The market value of $50.24/share reflects a valuation based on the company's **strong underlying cash flow from operations** (EBITDA/OCF), a much higher terminal growth rate (3%+), and an expectation of significant margin recovery back towards or above the 11% historical peak, combined with the successful, value-accretive growth of the self-storage and U-Box segments.
