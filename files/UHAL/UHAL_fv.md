### **II. Business Engine & Future Assumptions**

U-Haul's business is split into high-growth, high-margin, asset-heavy segments (Self-Storage/U-Box) and a mature, but necessary, core business (Self-Move Equipment Rental). The recent drop in net margin is due to two key headwinds: increased depreciation from new fleet purchases and reduced gains on the sale of retired equipment. Management expects these depreciation effects to persist but eventually trend downward [cite: 7 (from step 3), 17 (from step 2)].

#### **A. Revenue Projections (Conservative Model)**

| Segment/Metric | FY 2025 Base (USD Millions) | FY 2026 - FY 2030 Annual Growth Rate Assumption | Justification (Based on Earnings Calls) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Moving & Storage - Rental** (Core) | ~$3,730.0 (64% of FY2025 Rev) | **3.0%** | Q1 FY2026 revenue was up 4.3%, driven by price/revenue per transaction as transaction volume is "largely held steady." A conservative long-term growth of 3.0% accounts for moderate price hikes and steady, mature market demand [cite: 6 (from step 2)]. |
| **Self-Storage & U-Box** (Growth) | ~$1,100.0 (19% of FY2025 Rev) | **8.0%** | Self-Storage revenue was up 8.6% in Q1 FY2026. U-Box revenue was up 16% in Q1 FY2026. The company has a significant development pipeline (14.8 million nrsf) targeting a 10% IRR. An 8.0% conservative growth rate reflects the maturation of this pipeline offset by market competition [cite: 6 (from step 2), 14 (from step 2)]. |
| **Insurance & Other** (Steady) | ~$998.7 (17% of FY2025 Rev) | **2.0%** | A conservative rate for the steady, non-core insurance business. |
| **Total Consolidated Revenue** (FY2025: **\$5,828.7**) | | **~4.5% Blended Growth Rate** | The high-growth segments (20% of revenue) significantly lift the blended growth rate. |

**Projected Revenue (USD Millions)**

| Fiscal Year | FY 2025 (Base) | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | FY 2028 | FY 2029 | FY 2030 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Revenue** | **5,828.7** | **6,093.0** | **6,370.4** | **6,661.9** | **6,968.0** | **7,289.4** |

#### **B. Margin & Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Projections**

1.  **Net Margin Projection:**
    *   **FY 2025 Net Margin:** 6.30%. This is an anomaly due to non-cash depreciation and low gains on asset sales.
    *   **FY 2024 Net Margin:** 11.18%. This is a better, though slightly elevated, representation of a healthy year.
    *   **Assumption:** I will assume the company's efforts to rotate in new, more efficient equipment and the growth of its high-margin self-storage/U-Box segment will restore profitability. I will use a **conservative, normalized Net Margin of 8.0%** for all projected years. This is a mid-point between the recent distressed 6.3% and the more profitable 11.18% to reflect persistent cost/depreciation headwinds offset by structural growth.

2.  **ROIC on Retained Earnings:**
    *   **Assumption:** The company is asset-heavy and has a targeted 10% unlevered IRR on new storage developments [cite: 10 (from step 2)]. For the purposes of valuing the **reinvested net income** (the "cash" remaining after operations), I will use a very **conservative ROIC of 5.0%**. This accounts for the company's internal deployment of capital into its core business at a rate lower than its stated IRR target for conservatism.

### **III. Projected Net Income & Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**

The Net Income projection is calculated as: **Projected Net Income = (Projected Revenue \* Net Margin) + (Prior Year's Accumulated Cash \* ROIC)**

*   **FY 2026:** (5,828.7 \* 8.0%) + (988.8 \* 5.0%) = 466.3 + 49.4 = **515.7**
*   **FY 2027 Net Income:** (6,093.0 \* 8.0%) + (515.7 \* 5.0%) = 487.4 + 25.8 = **513.2**
*   **FY 2028 Net Income:** (6,370.4 \* 8.0%) + (513.2 \* 5.0%) = 509.6 + 25.7 = **535.3**
*   **FY 2029 Net Income:** (6,661.9 \* 8.0%) + (535.3 \* 5.0%) = 533.0 + 26.8 = **559.8**
*   **FY 2030 Net Income:** (6,968.0 \* 8.0%) + (559.8 \* 5.0%) = 557.4 + 28.0 = **585.4**

#### **DCF Model Parameters:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable): 9.0%** (Reflects the company's capital-intensive, cyclical, but stable market position. This is higher than their 10% unlevered IRR target, providing a safe margin.)
*   **Conservative Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate: 2.0%** (Assumes the company will grow long-term at the rate of global GDP/inflation, a very conservative long-term outlook for a market leader.)

| Fiscal Year (N) | Revenue (Millions) | Net Income / FCF (Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2026** (1) | 6,093.0 | 515.7 | 0.917 | 473.0 |
| **2027** (2) | 6,370.4 | 513.2 | 0.842 | 432.1 |
| **2028** (3) | 6,661.9 | 535.3 | 0.772 | 413.4 |
| **2029** (4) | 6,968.0 | 559.8 | 0.708 | 396.6 |
| **2030** (5) | 7,289.4 | 585.4 | 0.650 | 380.5 |
| **Sum of Projected NPVs (2026-2030)** | | | | **\$2,095.6 million** |

#### **Terminal Value Calculation (End of 2030):**

*   Terminal FCF = Net Income for 2030: **\$585.4 million**
*   Terminal Value (at end of 2030) = FCF * (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   Terminal Value = \$585.4 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02)
*   Terminal Value = \$597.1 / 0.07 = **\$8,530.0 million**
*   **NPV of Terminal Value** (Discounted back 5 years) = \$8,530.0 * 0.650 = **\$5,544.5 million**

#### **Total Equity Value Calculation:**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected FCF (2026-2030)** | \$2,095.6 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | \$5,544.5 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | \$7,640.1 |
| **Plus: Cash & Cash Equivalents** (3/31/2025) | \$988.8 |
| **Minus: Total Debt** (3/31/2025) | (\$7,229.4) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$1,409.5 million** |

### **IV. Fair Value and Justification**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value** (A) | \$1,409.5 million |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** (B) | 196,077,880 |
| **Fair Value per Share (A/B)** | **\$7.19** |
| **Current Stock Price (for comparison)** | \$55.33 |

#### **Conclusion and Justification for Discrepancy**

**Fair Value per Share (Calculated): \$7.19**
**Current Market Price per Share: \$55.33**

The calculated intrinsic fair value of **\$7.19** is substantially lower than the current market price, indicating a significant difference in assumptions between this conservative DCF model and the market's collective forecast.

**Why is the Fair Value so much lower than the Market Price?**

The primary reason for the large discrepancy is the market's assumption that U-Haul's earnings will *normalize and rapidly grow* to a much higher and more consistent Net Margin than the conservative **8.0%** used in this model.

1.  **Market Assumes Net Margin Reversion to Historical Norm/Higher EBITDA Multiples:**
    *   The market is likely valuing UHAL based on a higher operating metric, such as **Adjusted EBITDA**, which removes the high non-cash depreciation and fluctuating gains/losses on equipment sales that have suppressed Net Income. For instance, the Moving & Storage segment's trailing twelve months EBITDA was $1,650.3 million as of June 30, 2025 [cite: 7 (from step 3)]. A valuation based on a multiple of this larger, more stable EBITDA figure would yield a much higher stock price.
    *   The market expects the Net Margin to revert toward, or even exceed, the 11.18% seen in FY 2024, or the margins seen in the company's high-growth, high-profit segments. If a **12.0% Net Margin** (reflecting successful self-storage/U-Box maturation) was used, the calculated Fair Value would increase dramatically.

2.  **Market Values the Asset Base (Real Estate):**
    *   U-Haul is essentially a large, self-administered **real estate company** that operates a moving business. Its balance sheet is dominated by long-term assets (property, plant, and equipment), which totaled over \$15.5 billion as of June 30, 2025 [cite: 4 (from step 3)]. The market likely values this massive, appreciating real estate portfolio (often at market value, not just book value) and the development pipeline (14.8 million nrsf) much more highly than a simple DCF based on historical net income allows.

3.  **Conservative DCF Inputs:**
    *   The use of a **9.0% Discount Rate** and a **2.0% Terminal Growth Rate** is very conservative. The market, projecting a faster growth trajectory for the lucrative storage segment, likely uses a higher perpetual growth rate and may justify a lower cost of equity due to the company's dominant market position and stability.

In summary, the conservative DCF model primarily captures the discounted value of the company's recent, lower Net Income. The market is valuing UHAL on its **stable, yet appreciating, real estate assets** and the projected **high-margin growth of its self-storage and U-Box segments** being unburdened by temporary fleet depreciation headwinds, justifying a significantly higher price-to-earnings or enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple.
