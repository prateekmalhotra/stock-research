### II. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections

Proto Labs' core business engine is its **dual fulfillment model**—the proprietary **Digital Factory** (for speed and low-volume, high-margin parts) and the **Proto Labs Network** (for advanced capabilities, volume pricing, and larger production runs).

**Management Commentary & Engine Drivers:**
*   The primary driver of recent growth is the **U.S. CNC Machining** segment, with revenue growing 18.2% globally and 24% domestically in Q3 2025, particularly in aerospace and defense.
*   The **Network** platform continues to be a high-growth channel (up 16% in Q3 2025) and is key to the strategy of evolving "beyond prototyping and into production".
*   Management is guiding toward an acceleration of revenue growth, targeting a near-term return to low- to mid-single digits, accelerating to **high-single-digit growth by 2026**.
*   Management has committed to a comprehensive strategic plan to "accelerate profitable growth" with more details to be released in 2026.

**Conservative Revenue Projections (2025-2030):**

Based on management's stated goal to accelerate to high-single-digit growth, a conservative projection will assume a gradual acceleration followed by an inevitable slowdown as the company approaches maturity.

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions USD) | Y-o-Y Growth % | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | 525.63 | 5.0% (Est. FY) | Based on Q1-Q3 actuals and Q4 midpoint guidance. |
| **2026E** | 562.47 | **7.0%** | Conservative start of "high-single-digit" acceleration, reflecting initial success of the 2026 strategic plan rollout. |
| **2027E** | 602.84 | **7.2%** | Peak growth, leveraging the successful dual-model adoption and strong CNC demand, slightly above 7.0%. |
| **2028E** | 640.41 | **6.2%** | Conservative slowdown as the digital manufacturing market matures and competition intensifies. |
| **2029E** | 672.43 | **5.0%** | Mid-single-digit growth rate, reflecting more mature industry growth. |
| **2030E** | 699.33 | **4.0%** | Final slowing before perpetuity. |

### III. Margin & Net Income Projections

Management targets an **adjusted gross margin in the mid-40% range** and **adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-teens** (15%). The GAAP net income margin has been low (Q3 2025 GAAP Net Income Margin: 5.3%). The projection must be conservative while reflecting the management's push for profitability and higher-margin factory utilization.

**Conservative Net Income Margin Projection:**

| Year | Net Income Margin % | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | **5.5%** | Slightly above Q3 2025 GAAP Margin (5.3%) reflecting Q4 guidance. |
| **2026E** | **6.0%** | Initial benefit from the strategic plan and gross margin expansion (mid-40% target). |
| **2027E** | **6.5%** | Continued operating leverage as revenue accelerates into high-single digits. |
| **2028E** | **7.0%** | Peak operating efficiency from automation and a richer production mix. |
| **2029E** | **6.8%** | Slight decline to reflect increased competition and ongoing R&D investment. |
| **2030E** | **6.5%** | Stable long-term operating efficiency for terminal value calculation. |

**Net Income (NI) Calculation:**

| Year | Revenue (A) | NI Margin (B) | NI from Operations (A\*B) | Beginning Cash Balance | ROIC % | ROIC Income | Total Net Income (Projected Cash Flow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | $525.63 | 5.5% | **$28.91** | $138.66 | 3.0% | $4.16 | **$33.07** |
| **2026E** | $562.47 | 6.0% | **$33.75** | $171.73 | 3.0% | $5.15 | **$38.90** |
| **2027E** | $602.84 | 6.5% | **$39.18** | $210.63 | 3.0% | $6.32 | **$45.50** |
| **2028E** | $640.41 | 7.0% | **$44.83** | $256.13 | 3.0% | $7.68 | **$52.51** |
| **2029E** | $672.43 | 6.8% | **$45.72** | $308.64 | 3.0% | $9.26 | **$54.98** |
| **2030E** | $699.33 | 6.5% | **$45.46** | $363.62 | 3.0% | $10.91 | **$56.37** |

*NI from Operations is the Net Income before the ROIC income.
*Beginning Cash Balance for each year = Total Liquid Assets (Initial) + Sum of Previous Years' Total Net Income.
*ROIC Income = Beginning Cash Balance * ROIC %.
*Total Net Income (Projected Cash Flow) = NI from Operations + ROIC Income.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Total Net Income for each year is treated as the free cash flow to equity (FCFE) for the DCF model.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (at the end of 2030):**

*   Terminal Year FCFE (2030E): $56.37 million
*   Perpetuity Growth Rate (g): 2.0%
*   Discount Rate (r): 10.0%
*   Formula: TV = FCFE * (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   TV = $56.37 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = $57.40 / 0.08 = **$717.50 million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Cash Flows:**

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1/(1+0.10)^t) | Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=1) | $33.07 | 0.909 | $30.06 |
| **2026** (t=2) | $38.90 | 0.826 | $32.13 |
| **2027** (t=3) | $45.50 | 0.751 | $34.17 |
| **2028** (t=4) | $52.51 | 0.683 | $35.88 |
| **2029** (t=5) | $54.98 | 0.621 | $34.14 |
| **2030** (t=6) | $56.37 | 0.564 | $31.78 |
| **Terminal Value** (t=6) | $717.50 | 0.564 | $404.99 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value)** | | | **$603.15 million** |

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value) | $603.15 |
| Add: Total Liquid Assets (Cash) | $138.66 |
| Less: Total Debt | ($1.19) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$740.62** |
| Shares Outstanding | 23.68 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$31.28** |

---

### VI. Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is $31.28**, which is significantly lower than the Current Market Price of **$54.76**. This implies that the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about Proto Labs' future growth and profitability than this conservative DCF model.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. DCF Assumptions:**

| DCF Assumption (Conservative) | Market's Implicit Assumption (Optimistic) | Justification for Market's View |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth:** Accelerating to 7.2% by 2027, then declining to 4.0%. | **Revenue Growth:** Consistent double-digit growth (e.g., 10% to 12%+) over the next decade. | The market is likely pricing in the massive *total addressable market (TAM)* of digital manufacturing, assuming the **Proto Labs Network** (growing at 16%+) will become the dominant, high-growth component, successfully pulling in larger production orders and capturing significant market share from traditional manufacturing. |
| **Net Income Margin:** Gradually rising to a peak of 7.0%. | **Net Income Margin:** Rises much faster and higher (e.g., 10% to 15%) reflecting **significant operating leverage** and successful cost rationalization from the new CEO's strategic plan (which is set to be fully unveiled in 2026). The market believes the shift to the 'Network' model will drive higher asset utilization and gross margin (which management guides to the mid-40% range). |
| **Discount Rate (r):** 10.0% | **Discount Rate (r):** Lower, reflecting an assumption of less systematic risk and a higher credit rating/lower cost of capital over time due to improving profitability. |

**Conclusion:**

The DCF calculation of **$31.28 per share** is conservative, strictly adhering to management's near-term guidance of a high-single-digit growth acceleration and modest profitability improvement. The current market price of **$54.76** suggests the market has *already priced in* the success of the new strategic plan that management is set to detail in 2026, assuming Proto Labs will achieve long-term double-digit revenue growth and significantly higher net income margins (near or above 10%) by capitalizing on the massive shift to on-demand digital manufacturing.

**Fair Value Per Share: $31.28**
