## II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Noble Corporation is a contract driller, meaning its revenue is driven by:
1.  **Fleet Utilization:** The percentage of time their rigs are on contract.
2.  **Average Day Rates:** The price charged per day for the drilling services.
3.  **Fleet Size:** The number of rigs (24 marketed floaters as of Jan 2026).

**Management Commentary & Market Cycle:**
*   **2025:** Full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance is strong at \$1.1 - \$1.125 billion.
*   **2026:** Management expects an **EBITDA trough** in the first half of 2026 due to market softening, followed by a recovery towards late 2026.
*   **2027 & Beyond:** A market inflection and increasing deepwater activity are anticipated in late 2026 or early 2027. New contracts are being signed at higher rates (\$300k - \$473M over three years), and marketed drillship utilization is projected to be 94% for 2027 (industry-wide). The company has a substantial backlog of over **\$8.3 billion** that smooths out near-term fluctuations.

**Conservative Revenue Model Assumptions:**

| Year | Rationale | Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | Using the midpoint of management's Adj. EBITDA guidance (\$1.1125B) and a conservative Q3 2025 Adj. EBITDA margin (32%) to back into Revenue. | **\$3,476 Million** (Calculated: \$1,112.5M / 0.32) |
| **2026** | Reflects the anticipated H1 trough and flat/lower day rates from contracts rolling off, despite new contracts starting later in the year. A conservative year-over-year **decrease**. | **-2.5%** |
| **2027** | Reflects the predicted market inflection, rising day rates from newly signed, higher-priced contracts, and near-max utilization. | **+10.0%** |
| **2028** | Continued strong growth as the industry cycle is in full swing, but moderating from the inflection year. | **+8.0%** |
| **2029** | Stable, high-utilization operations with moderate growth as the cycle matures. | **+5.0%** |
| **2030** | Further moderation, projecting a conservative, sustained growth rate. | **+4.0%** |

## III. Projected Financials and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

### 1. Projections (Millions USD)

The valuation assumes that Net Income is a reasonable proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the purposes of this DCF.

| Metric | Calculation | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Revenue** | Base year derived from guidance, then growth rates applied. | **3,476** | **3,388** | **3,727** | **4,025** | **4,226** | **4,395** |
| **B. Net Income Margin** | Conservative estimate below Q4 2024's 11.0%. | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% |
| **C. Initial Net Income** (A * B) | --- | 348 | 339 | 373 | 403 | 423 | 440 |
| **D. Prior Year Cash (Net Income)** | Year-over-year carry-over of net income. | (Starting NI) | 348 | 339 | 373 | 403 | 423 |
| **E. ROIC** (Conservative) | Conservative rate below historical 5.77%. | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| **F. ROIC Income** (D * E) | Additional income generated from retained earnings. | 17 | 17 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 |
| **G. Total Cash Flow (Net Income)** (C + F) | Represents the estimated Free Cash Flow for the DCF. | **365** | **356** | **392** | **423** | **444** | **462** |

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%** (Conservative given a historical 9.00% WACC and offshore sector risk)
*   **Terminal Value Growth Rate (Maturity Rate):** **2.0%** (A very conservative long-term growth rate for a cyclical industry)

| Year | Cash Flow (FCF) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^t) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$365 | 0.9091 | \$332 |
| **2026** | \$356 | 0.8264 | \$294 |
| **2027** | \$392 | 0.7513 | \$294 |
| **2028** | \$423 | 0.6830 | \$289 |
| **2029** | \$444 | 0.6209 | \$276 |
| **2030** | \$462 | 0.5645 | \$261 |
| **Sum of PV (2025-2030)** | --- | --- | **\$1,746** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (End of 2030):**
*   TV = [FCF 2030 * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (WACC - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV = [\$462 * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = \$471.24 / 0.08 = **\$5,891 Million**

**Terminal Value Net Present Value (TV-NPV):**
*   TV-NPV = TV / (1 + WACC)^6
*   TV-NPV = \$5,891 / (1.10)^6 = \$5,891 / 1.7716 = **\$3,325 Million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
*   Total NPV = Sum of PV (2025-2030) + TV-NPV
*   Total NPV = \$1,746 + \$3,325 = **\$5,071 Million**

## IV. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### 1. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | **\$5,071** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$478 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$1,950 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$3,599** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 158.85 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** (Equity Value / Shares Outstanding) | **\$22.66** |

### 2. Market Comparison and Justification

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Value | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$22.66** | **\$37.02** | **-38.8%** |

The calculated fair value of **\$22.66** per share is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$37.02**.

**Justification for the Difference:**

The substantial difference implies that **the market's consensus assumptions for Noble Corporation's future cash flows are significantly more optimistic than the conservative assumptions used in this valuation.**

1.  **More Aggressive Day Rate/Utilization Assumptions:**
    *   **The Market:** Is likely pricing in much higher day rates (e.g., \$500k to \$600k for high-spec rigs) and a faster ramp-up of utilization starting earlier than late 2026. The market is projecting a steeper and longer-duration up-cycle than the modest **10%** and **8%** growth rates assumed for 2027-2028 in this analysis.
    *   **Conservative Valuation:** The revenue growth reflects a conservative, delayed recovery, and the terminal value assumes only 2.0% perpetual growth, which is a significant dampener compared to a high-growth "re-rating" scenario the market may be anticipating.

2.  **Higher Terminal Value/Lower Discount Rate:**
    *   **The Market:** May be using a significantly lower cost of capital (Discount Rate/WACC) than the conservative **10.0%** used here, reflecting the company's strong balance sheet post-debt restructuring and its superior, high-spec fleet. A lower WACC significantly inflates the NPV and especially the Terminal Value (e.g., a 9.0% WACC and 3.0% growth would yield a fair value closer to the current price).
    *   **The Market:** Is also likely projecting a much higher long-term growth rate for the Terminal Value (e.g., 3.0% - 4.0%), capitalizing on the structural supply constraints in the offshore drilling industry (due to high replacement cost and lack of new-builds), which Noble is uniquely positioned to capitalize on with its fleet.

3.  **Margin/ROIC Optimism:**
    *   **The Market:** Is likely anticipating an immediate and sustained increase in the Net Income Margin above the conservative **10.0%** used here, leveraging the high operating leverage of the drilling business as day rates increase. They may also project a higher ROIC than the **5.0%** used, reflecting superior capital allocation.

In conclusion, the market is pricing in a **stronger, faster, and more sustained up-cycle** for the offshore drilling sector and Noble Corporation specifically, due to its premium assets and high contract backlog. This conservative valuation serves as a margin of safety, suggesting that the current stock price can only be justified by assuming a best-case or near-best-case scenario for the upcoming cyclical recovery.
