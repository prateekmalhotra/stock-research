## Company History

Here's a history of Noble Corporation plc (NE):

**Inception and Founding Purpose:**

1.  Noble Corporation's story began in 1921 when its founder, Lloyd Noble, established the Noble Drilling Company in Ardmore, Oklahoma. The business was founded after oil was discovered on his family's farm, revealing the potential for a new venture in oil exploration and drilling.
2.  Initially, Noble operated as a small, single-rig contractor. The company's early growth was fueled by significant discoveries, such as the Seminole field in Oklahoma, which became one of the largest in the state.
3.  The core purpose was to provide contract drilling services for the oil and gas industry, a mission that has remained central to the company throughout its history.

**Growth and Early Development:**

4.  In its early decades, Noble focused on building its expertise and fleet within the United States. The company even contributed to the war effort during the 1940s by drilling in England to boost domestic production, and back home, it pioneered offshore drilling in the US, drilling the first well off the Atlantic coast in North Carolina.
5.  Lloyd Noble diversified the business into oil production in 1932, creating Samedan Oil Corporation (later Noble Energy), to complement the drilling operations. His interests in Noble Drilling and Samedan were transferred to The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation upon his death in 1950, with both companies operating as subsidiaries until the late 1960s.

**Expansion and Evolution:**

6.  A significant expansion phase began in the early 1990s when the company acquired several new rigs and started to expand its operations internationally. This marked a shift from a primarily domestic operation to a global one.
7.  Over the decades, Noble has undergone several structural and domicile changes. It moved its domicile to the Cayman Islands in 2002, then to Switzerland in early 2009, and finally to the United Kingdom in 2013, where it is now incorporated.
8.  The company has strategically grown its fleet through acquisitions, such as the purchase of Frontier Drilling in 2010 for $2.16 billion, and by investing in new builds. This has allowed Noble to transition to a modern and advanced fleet.

17. **Headwinds:** The energy transition from hydrocarbons to renewables poses a significant challenge to the oil and gas sector and Noble's market. Global macroeconomic concerns can put downward pressure on oil and gas prices and overall rig demand. Additionally, the market can experience softening demand and reducing backlogs, leading to more idle time between contracts and potentially more competitive bidding environments.

**Noble's Goal:**

18. Noble Corporation's overarching goal is to be the leading offshore driller, recognized for operational excellence, safety, and delivering value to its stakeholders. Their mission is to "Drill to power the world responsibly," emphasizing a commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, and creating long-term value for shareholders, employees, and customers.

## Management Incentive

Here's an analysis of Noble Corporation plc's (NE) management incentives and compensation:

1.  **Insider Ownership:**
    *   Individual insiders collectively own a small percentage of Noble Corporation's shares, around 1.65%. This is a relatively low percentage, with institutional investors holding the vast majority of shares (approximately 98.4%). Generally, higher insider ownership is seen as a positive sign, indicating that management's interests are more aligned with those of shareholders.

2.  **Executive Compensation Structure:**
    *   The compensation for top executives, including the CEO, is heavily weighted towards bonuses, stock awards, and options, rather than base salary. For example, in the 2024 fiscal year, the CEO's total compensation was approximately $12.04 million, with only about 7.8% as salary and the rest in bonuses, stock, and options. This structure aims to tie executive pay to company performance and shareholder value.
    *   In 2014, CEO David W. Williams received total compensation of $14.07 million, composed of base salary, stock awards, and other compensation. Other executives like the EVP and CFO also had significant portions of their compensation in stock awards.

3.  **Compensation vs. Performance and Market:**
    *   In the past year, the CEO's compensation has increased significantly (over 20%), while company earnings have declined (over 20%). This specific instance raises questions about the direct correlation between executive pay and company profitability in that period.
    *   The CEO's total compensation is noted to be above the average for similar-sized companies in the US market.

4.  **Incentive Alignment with Shareholders:**
    *   The significant portion of compensation tied to stock awards and bonuses suggests an intention to align executive interests with shareholder interests, as stock value and bonuses are typically linked to company performance and stock price appreciation.
    *   However, the fact that executive compensation has risen while earnings have fallen in a specific recent period might suggest a potential for executives to be incentivized by factors other than pure shareholder value, or that the compensation structure may not always perfectly reflect short-term performance fluctuations.
    *   The low insider ownership percentage means that while executives hold stock, their personal financial stake might not be as substantial as that of large institutional investors, potentially reducing the direct impact of shareholder interests on their decision-making.

5.  **Director Compensation:**
    *   Non-executive directors receive annual retainers and equity awards in the form of restricted share units, vesting after one year. For example, the non-executive board chairman receives an annual retainer of $150,000, and other non-employee directors receive $100,000, plus equity valued at $180,000-$230,000. Committee chairs and members also receive additional retainers.

**Conclusion:**

Noble Corporation plc's compensation structure, heavily reliant on stock-based incentives, appears designed to align executive interests with those of shareholders. The substantial equity awards and bonuses are intended to reward performance and stock appreciation. However, the relatively low insider ownership and instances where executive compensation has increased despite declining company earnings warrant careful consideration. While the incentive structure aims for alignment, it's crucial to monitor the long-term correlation between executive pay, company performance, and shareholder returns to definitively conclude whether executives are sufficiently incentivized to act in the shareholders' best interest or primarily their own.
