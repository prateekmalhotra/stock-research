## Business Summary

Expedia Group operates a large, global online marketplace that allows travelers to search, compare, and book nearly all aspects of a trip, including hotels, flights, vacation rentals (through Vrbo), and rental cars. The core customers are individual consumers booking leisure and business trips across North America and Europe. Expedia Group primarily generates revenue through two methods. First, using the Agency Model, it acts as a booking agent, earning a commission (a fee or percentage) from the travel supplier (like a hotel) for every successful booking. Second, using the Merchant Model, the company purchases inventory, such as hotel rooms, at a discounted wholesale rate, marks up the price, and then sells it to the customer, keeping the price difference. The overall business relies heavily on high consumer traffic and transaction volume to be profitable.

## Business Model Risk

Expedia faces significant threats due to its reliance on discretionary consumer spending, meaning that economic slowdowns, inflation, or recessions cause travelers to immediately cut back on bookings, severely harming earnings. A critical near-term risk is the company's dependency on large search engines, primarily Google, for customer traffic. If Google changes its search algorithms to favor its own travel products (Google Flights or Google Hotels), Expedia's organic traffic drops drastically, forcing the company to spend billions more on paid advertising to maintain its market position, which reduces profit margins. This threat is constant and has historically hurt earnings whenever Google shifts focus. Longer term, intense competition from rival online travel agencies, direct booking efforts by major hotel chains, and alternative rental platforms like Airbnb necessitate continuous, massive investments in technology and marketing just to maintain market share. Furthermore, systemic risks like global pandemics, wars, or natural disasters pose a profound threat, as they can instantly shut down international travel and have proven in the past to halt nearly all revenue generation for extended periods.

## Company History

Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) is one of the world's largest online travel companies. It is a technology platform that connects travelers with hotels, airlines, rental cars, and vacation rentals through a portfolio of well-known brands.

***

### **I. Inception and Purpose: Why the Business was Founded**

1.  **A Project within Microsoft (1996):** Expedia did not start as an independent startup; it was launched as a division inside the technology giant Microsoft.
2.  **The Founder's Vision:** Rich Barton spearheaded the project with the initial goal of revolutionizing the travel industry.
3.  **Solving a Problem:** The main purpose was to address the inefficiencies and inconvenience of traditional travel agencies, which required phone calls and limited information.
4.  **Putting Power in the Consumer's Hands:** The new online platform was designed to give everyday travelers more control, convenience, and a single hub to search, compare, and book their entire trip.
5.  **What the Name Means:** The name "Expedia" is believed to be a combination of "exploration" and "speed," reflecting the core mission to make travel search and booking fast and comprehensive.
6.  **Current Goal:** Expedia Group’s core purpose today is "to bring the world within reach," using technology to simplify and enhance the entire travel process for both customers and partners.

***

### **II. Milestones and Evolution: From Website to Global Group**

7.  **Becoming an Independent Company (1999):** After three years of success as an internal project, Microsoft spun off Expedia as its own independent, publicly-traded company to allow it more autonomy and flexibility for rapid growth.
8.  **The Acquisition Phase (2000s - Present):** A key strategy has been to acquire other travel companies to quickly expand its market reach, customer base, and service offerings.
9.  **Building a Portfolio of Brands:** Over time, the company added well-known brands to its portfolio, including Hotels.com, Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz, and HomeAway (later rebranded as Vrbo).
10. **A Major Spin-Off:** In 2011, the company spun off TripAdvisor, a popular travel review website, allowing it to focus primarily on the transaction-based travel booking business.
11. **Rebranding to a "Group" (2018):** The company officially rebranded to Expedia Group, Inc. to signify that it was no longer just a single online travel agency, but a large, global technology platform encompassing multiple distinct brands and services.

***

### **III. Problems and Innovative Solutions**

12. **Early Challenge: Customer Service Crisis:** Around 2012, an astounding 58% of customers would call the company for support, often for simple issues like retrieving a missing trip itinerary, which cost the company millions.
13. **Innovative Solution: Proactive Self-Service:** Expedia created a special team with the mandate to prevent customers from needing to call at all (an "upstream" fix).
14. **Putting the Customer First:** Solutions included adding self-service options on the website, making itinerary emails less likely to go to spam, and offering an automated phone system option to resend an itinerary, which drastically reduced call volume.
15. **Challenge: Outdated Technology:** Years of rapid growth and acquisitions led to slow and complicated technology systems that made it difficult to innovate quickly.
16. **Solution: Massive Technology Investment:** The company invested heavily in rebuilding its core technology platform ("refactoring the back-end") to make its systems faster and more unified across all its brands.
17. **Current Challenge: Bloated Structure:** Management recognized the company had grown "big without many of the benefits of scale," as different brands operated with separate systems and competitive internal structures.
18. **Current Solution: Simplification and Unification:** The ongoing strategy is to simplify the entire organization, create one common technology platform for all brands, and unify its rewards system into a single loyalty program.

***

### **IV. Market Forces: Tailwinds and Headwinds**

#### **Tailwinds (Favorable Market Conditions)**

19. **The Internet Revolution:** The most significant tailwind was the massive, long-term shift of consumers moving from booking travel through traditional agencies (offline) to booking online.
20. **The Mobile Era:** The rise of smartphones created a new opportunity for travelers to book and manage their trips on the go, a shift the company was able to capitalize on by becoming "mobile-first" in its design.
21. **Post-Downturn Travel Growth:** Following major economic slowdowns, global travel demand consistently returned and grew exponentially, helping to fuel the company's financial recovery and growth.

#### **Headwinds (Challenges and Resistance)**

22. **Economic Crises:** Economic downturns, such as the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the 2008 financial crisis, caused significant drops in travel demand and financial instability.
23. **Intense Competition:** The company constantly faces fierce competition from its main rival, Booking Holdings, as well as new challengers like Airbnb (in the vacation rental space) and from airlines/hotels that encourage customers to book directly.
24. **The COVID-19 Pandemic:** This presented an unprecedented "existential threat" to the entire travel industry, forcing the company to adapt extremely quickly by focusing on aggressive cost-cutting and managing major changes in travel patterns.
25. **Wary Consumers and Moderating Growth (Current):** More recently, economic uncertainty has acted as a headwind, leading cash-strapped consumers to seek out cheaper "value play" vacations, which moderates the company's growth rate.

## Moat Analysis

Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) operates in a highly competitive market, but its size and multi-faceted business model have allowed it to build a formidable, though not impenetrable, economic moat.

### The Foundation of Expedia's Moat

1.  **Network Effects:** Expedia operates a two-sided marketplace where more travelers (demand) attract more lodging partners and travel suppliers (supply), and more supply attracts even more travelers. This "virtuous cycle" of supply and demand creates a strong, self-reinforcing competitive advantage that is difficult for a new entrant to replicate quickly.
2.  **Duopoly Scale and High Barrier to Entry:** Along with Booking Holdings, Expedia dominates the global Online Travel Agency (OTA) market. To challenge this duopoly, a new competitor would need to spend billions on advertising to attract customers, and billions more on IT systems, data centers, and building relationships with travel suppliers worldwide, making displacement extremely difficult for a new player, even one with significant capital.
3.  **Stellar Portfolio of Brands:** The Group's sheer number of well-known and trusted brands, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Hotwire, allows it to target different customer segments and travel needs simultaneously, capturing a broader share of the market.

### Special Position, Pricing Power, and Differentiation

4.  **Special Position: Strength in Full-Service Travel and the U.S. Market:** Historically, Expedia has been a leader in offering a full-service platform where customers can easily book a comprehensive trip (flights, hotels, cars, activities) in one place, a position it long held over competitors who were often more specialized. It also holds a historically strong position in the North American market.
5.  **B2B and Supply Partnerships as a Unique Differentiator:** A key unique strength is its massive Business-to-Business (B2B) segment, which provides its technology and supply (hotel rooms, etc.) to thousands of other businesses, including airlines, financial institutions, and traditional travel agents through programs like Expedia Partner Solutions. These deep, long-term relationships, such as the Optimized Distribution Program signed with major hotel chains like Marriott and IHG, make those contracts quite sticky and diversify Expedia's revenue beyond just consumer bookings.
6.  **Pricing Power through Added Value, Not Just Lowest Price:** Expedia's scale and importance to hotels allow it to negotiate favorable rates (commissions). While smaller OTAs compete strictly on price, Expedia and Booking have enough brand strength and added value (like loyalty programs) that they can maintain a strong market position even if they are not the absolute cheapest option in every search. The company can aggressively use its loyalty program to offer member-only discounts that effectively undercut standard hotel rates.

### Customer Stickiness and Strategic Investments

7.  **Sticky and Recurring Customers via Loyalty:** The introduction of the single, unified loyalty program, **One Key**, across its core brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo) is a major strategic move to increase customer stickiness. Loyalty programs like this create switching costs, as customers have a significant incentive (like earning free nights) to continue booking within the Expedia ecosystem rather than starting over with a competitor.
8.  **Heavy Investment in R&D and Innovation:** Expedia invests a sustained and high amount of capital into technology and R&D, with annual R&D expenses often exceeding $1 billion and representing a significant percentage of its revenue. This constant investment is crucial because the online travel business is a technology-driven battlefield.
9.  **The Single Platform Strategy to Deepen the Moat:** The company has been undergoing a massive, multi-year project to unify all of its different brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, etc.) onto a single, common technology platform. This is intended to improve operational efficiency, make it easier to "innovate at scale" (introduce new features across all brands simultaneously), and leverage data and AI more effectively to drive better traveler experiences. This technological integration is a long-term effort to build a stronger and more efficient competitive edge.

## Catalysts for Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE)

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Accelerated Vrbo Performance Improvement:**
    *   Following a period of slower recovery post-technology migration, the Vrbo vacation rental business showed a "significant acceleration" in performance in the second quarter of 2024 and returned to growth in the second half of the year, according to management.
    *   Sustained growth and an increase in bookings at Vrbo would remove a drag on the overall business and boost the stock price.

2.  **Continued B2B and Advertising Outperformance:**
    *   Expedia for Business (B2B) has been a consistent high-growth engine, with bookings growing double digits for 16 consecutive quarters and B2B revenue increasing by 15% to 26% in recent quarters.
    *   Continued expansion in the B2B and Advertising segments provides a stable and high-margin revenue stream that lessens reliance on the core consumer business.

3.  **Realization of Technology-Driven Cost Efficiencies:**
    *   Management has stated that following the completion of its core technology platform migrations, including Vrbo, they expect to "deprecate systems and redeploy resources" to realize substantial cost savings starting in 2024 and beyond.
    *   These expected cost reductions are anticipated to drive EBITDA margin expansion, which is a key measure of profitability and a direct positive for the stock.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Success of the Unified Technology Platform and Loyalty Program:**
    *   The company has completed its multi-year technology overhaul to operate on a single platform, which is expected to allow for faster innovation, product improvements, and marketing efficiency across all brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo).
    *   The unified **One Key loyalty program** is building momentum and is a crucial part of the long-term strategy to drive higher-value, repeat customers (high-ROI customers) and increase customer lifetime value.

2.  **Sustained International Market Growth:**
    *   Recent results have shown stronger travel demand internationally compared to the U.S., which led to double-digit international revenue growth in recent quarters.
    *   The long-term catalyst is capitalizing on global travel demand and further expanding market share outside the challenging U.S. consumer market.

3.  **Share Repurchases and Capital Allocation:**
    *   Management continues to execute on an aggressive share repurchase program (repurchasing over $950 million in the first half of 2025 in the search context) and has a new, large authorization from the board.
    *   This commitment to returning capital to shareholders, along with a newly declared quarterly dividend, signals confidence in long-term cash flow generation and provides direct support for the stock price.

3.  **Core Team Tenure:** The current management team has a relatively low average tenure of about 1.3 years (as of late 2024/early 2025), reflecting the recent, substantial leadership transitions.

### **Previous Management and Key Decisions (The Kern Era)**

4.  **2019 Leadership Crisis:** In December 2019, CEO Mark Okerstrom and CFO Alan Pickerill resigned following a strategic disagreement with the Board. Chairman Barry Diller stated the prior leadership's reorganization had caused a "material loss of focus on our current operations" and led to disappointing results.
5.  **Peter Kern's Turnaround Mandate (2020-2024):** Peter Kern was appointed CEO in April 2020 to "right the ship," leading the company through the highly challenging pandemic years. His core promise was an ambitious organizational and technological transformation to simplify the sprawling company.
6.  **Delivering on Transformation:** Kern's management successfully consolidated over 20 global brands down to three core brands in most regions and replaced a complex IT structure with a single, unified technology stack. He also replaced 76 global agencies with a single in-house marketing team and rationalized 17 different customer relationship management (CRM) systems into one platform.
7.  **Shareholder Value Track Record (Kern):** Under Kern's leadership, the company achieved record lodging gross bookings and revenue in 2023, with adjusted net income rebounding to $1.4 billion.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Expedia Group's (EXPE) proxy statements (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure is heavily weighted toward aligning with shareholder interests, particularly through equity and performance-based metrics, though the control structure is also a major factor.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Compensation Structure is Equity-Centric:** The majority of Named Executive Officer (NEO) total compensation is in the form of equity awards, not cash salary. For example, CEO Ariane Gorin's 2024 total compensation of approximately \$25.08 million was comprised of only 4.5% salary, with the remaining 95.5% in bonuses, stock, and options, directly linking her financial outcome to the company's stock price performance.

2.  **Use of Performance-Based Equity:** The long-term incentive (LTI) plan utilizes Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PSUs), which vest based on achieving pre-established performance conditions over a multi-year period (e.g., two to three years). This structure is designed to reward both stock price appreciation and specific financial goals.

3.  **Key Performance Metrics:** The PSUs have been tied to important metrics like **Adjusted EBITDA**, **Operational Efficiency**, and overall **Stock Price Performance**, which are indicators of fundamental business health and long-term shareholder value creation.

4.  **Significant Insider and Controlling Ownership:** The company has a notable and long-standing concentration of insider control. Insiders, primarily the Liberty entities associated with Executive Chairman Barry Diller, collectively hold a large percentage of shares (e.g., Liberty Expedia Holdings Inc. holds 23.13% and Liberty Media Corp holds 20.14%), indicating a high vested interest in the long-term success of the company.

5.  **Managerial Ownership Value:** While the percentage of direct ownership for the new CEO, Ariane Gorin, is small (0.072%), the *value* is significant (approximately \$19.17 million), ensuring a substantial portion of her personal wealth is directly tied to the stock price.

### **Conclusion on Incentives and Alignment**

*   **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest (High):** The compensation structure strongly incentivizes management to act in the interest of shareholders because the overwhelming majority of executive pay is long-term equity, specifically tied to metrics like Adjusted EBITDA and Stock Price Performance, which directly correlate with shareholder value. The large, controlling insider ownership by key figures further reinforces a long-term alignment motive.
*   **Incentive for Personal Gain (Low Risk, but Present):** The risk of management "lining their own pockets" with excessive *base pay* is low, given that salary is a small percentage of total pay. However, the sheer size of the total compensation, when compared to the market average for companies of similar size, is high (e.g., CEO compensation is above the average for similar US market companies), which could suggest a highly paid structure, even if performance-driven.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** Expedia's management is strongly incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders due to the heavy reliance on **performance-based equity** and the presence of **significant, controlling insider ownership**.

## Long Thesis

Expedia Group has finished the massive, multi-year project of merging its many brands (like Vrbo and Hotels.com) onto one unified, fast technology platform. This strategic cleanup is the key reason for the bull case, as it immediately cuts billions in operating costs and eliminates waste, leading to much bigger profit margins for the company in the near term. The new management team is now shifting from 'fixing' the business to 'growing' it. They will leverage this efficient platform to accelerate performance in the high-growth vacation rental business (Vrbo) and its strong business-to-business (B2B) travel solutions segment. The unified customer loyalty program, One Key, will keep customers sticky and drive repeat bookings. As global travel demand remains robust, a newly efficient and focused Expedia can easily increase its market share while simultaneously realizing greater profitability, which will push the stock price higher.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that the company’s expensive and complex technological transformation has genuinely been completed and that the expected massive cost savings and operational efficiencies will be realized in the financial reports, driving immediate profit growth. It must also be assumed that global travel demand remains healthy and is not significantly impacted by a deep recession or international conflict. Furthermore, the Vrbo vacation rental segment must successfully maintain its recently accelerated growth to fully realize the benefits of the new platform, and competitive threats from rivals like Booking Holdings or increased self-booking by major hotel chains must remain manageable.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Expedia Group (EXPE) contains several fundamental flaws and optimistic assumptions that are directly contradicted or complicated by recent market data and the consequences of its own operational pivot.

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Platform Integration Impact Understated:** The thesis frames the platform migration as a simple, complete success leading to "immediate" cost-cutting. In reality, the consolidation caused significant **user experience disruption** at key brands like Vrbo and Hotels.com, resulting in those brands *lagging* in performance. Vrbo's subsequent accelerated growth is accurately described by the company as a "recovery" and involved restoring lost features, not purely an effortless dividend of the new platform efficiency.

2.  **Loyalty Program Risk is Ignored:** The assumption that the "One Key" loyalty program "will keep customers sticky" is severely challenged. The program's rollout caused widespread **user dissatisfaction and a notable decrease in bookings** at Hotels.com due to an approximate **80% devaluation** of rewards for long-time members. This customer alienation risks driving high-value, repeat customers directly to competitors like Booking.com.

3.  **"Market Share Increase" is an Overreach:** The thesis assumes a newly efficient Expedia "can easily increase its market share." However, Expedia operates in a fierce and capital-intensive market dominated by rivals.
    *   **Booking Holdings (BKNG)** remains the **global leader** in the online travel agency (OTA) space and reported a significant 9% increase in gross bookings in 2024, continuing its global dominance, while Expedia's consumer (B2C) bookings growth was more modest, at 3% in Q3 2024.
    *   **Vrbo Lags Significantly:** In the "high-growth vacation rental business," Vrbo's 21% US market share is dwarfed by **Airbnb's 43%** and is only 2% in Europe, where Booking.com leads with 48%. The competitive gap in the largest and fastest-growing segment is immense.

4.  **"Massive Cost Savings" May Not Outpace Marketing Spend:** While operating income is seeing improvement (up 26% in Q3 2024), the competitive pressure forces the OTA giants to spend record amounts on customer acquisition. In 2024, Expedia Group increased its sales and marketing expenses by **12% to $6.8 billion**, demonstrating that any internal cost efficiency gains are being immediately offset by the need to ramp up external spending just to maintain a competitive position and drive the "recovery".

5.  **Growth Relies on a Less Profitable Segment:** The strong performance in the B2B segment is a major positive (18% revenue growth in Q3 2024), but this business often carries **lower profit margins** compared to the high-margin direct-to-consumer (B2C) lodging business, which is the segment most directly hurt by the platform and loyalty program issues. This creates a mix shift where overall revenue growth is skewed toward the less lucrative pillar.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE)

Expedia is a company focused on "fixing" past technical debt and facing structural competitive challenges rather than one positioned for aggressive, organic market share expansion and margin growth.

1.  **Execution Risk and Platform "Recovery":** The "completed" technology platform is not a growth engine yet, but a necessary **fix to stop a decline**. The migration severely disrupted the user experience on Vrbo and Hotels.com, forcing the company to use its post-integration phase to recover lost ground and reinstate basic functionality, rather than immediately leaping ahead of rivals.

2.  **Damaged Customer Loyalty and Retention:** The disastrous rollout of the One Key loyalty program, which resulted in a massive **reward devaluation and a decline in bookings** on Hotels.com, has alienated long-time, high-value customers. This brand damage undermines the core strategy of using a unified loyalty program to create "stickiness" and will likely increase future customer acquisition costs (CAC) as churn rises.

3.  **Vast Competitive Disadvantage in Key Verticals:** Despite Vrbo's recent recovery, it is losing the market share battle against **Airbnb**, which maintains a dominant position, particularly in international and broader accommodation types. Meanwhile, **Booking Holdings** continues its lead in the global OTA market, growing faster and operating at a larger scale, putting significant pressure on Expedia's ability to "easily increase its market share."

4.  **Cost Savings are Reinvested into Maintenance Marketing:** The expected "billions in operating cost cuts" are being immediately funneled into an increasingly expensive marketing war. The need to accelerate growth and recover lost share in B2C requires massive sales and marketing expenditure to compete with the sheer scale and brand strength of its main competitors, thus **capping meaningful and sustainable profit margin expansion** for the foreseeable future.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis you've performed, the central conflict of the investment thesis is clearly defined: **The successful completion of the technology overhaul and B2B growth vs. the unrelenting competitive pressure and execution risks in the B2C segment (Vrbo/One Key).**

The following points represent the most important next steps to quantify this conflict and validate the core assumptions of both the long and bear cases.

### **Next Steps to Investigate and Unanswered Questions**

#### **I. Quantify the Competitive Threat and Performance Gap**

1.  **Direct Financial Comparison with Booking Holdings (BKNG) on Key Metrics:**
    *   While we know Booking is the global leader, we need to precisely compare the most recent reported **Gross Bookings Growth Rate** and **B2C Lodging Revenue Growth Rate** for both companies. *The current data shows Booking significantly outperformed Expedia in Q3 2023 Gross Bookings (24% vs. 7%) and Net Income ($2.5B vs. $425M); this historical gap must be checked against the most recent available quarters (e.g., Q1 and Q2 of the current year) to see if Expedia's turnaround is actually closing the gap.*
    *   **Action:** Search for the latest quarter-over-quarter growth rates (e.g., Q1/Q2 2025) for Gross Bookings and B2C Lodging.

2.  **Evaluate Vrbo's International Growth and Market Share Strategy:**
    *   Vrbo's market share in the U.S. (21%) is substantial, but its share in the critical European market is a mere 2%, which is a significant weakness compared to Booking.com (48%) and Airbnb (40%).
    *   **Question:** What are the *specific, quantifiable goals* and investments (e.g., new partnerships, supply growth targets) for Vrbo's expansion into Europe and Asia, and what is the current market's perception of its traction in those markets?

#### **II. Validate the Margin Expansion Thesis (Cost Savings vs. Marketing War)**

3.  **Analyze the Sales & Marketing (S&M) Efficiency Trend:**
    *   The bear case argues cost savings are negated by marketing spend. We need a clear, multi-quarter trend of **Sales & Marketing Expense as a percentage of Revenue (S&M/Revenue)** for Expedia, and compare it to Booking and Airbnb. *The current data shows Expedia is the biggest spender, with Q1 marketing at 56.9% of revenues, significantly higher than Booking's 36.4% and Airbnb's 24%.*
    *   **Question:** Has management provided specific forward guidance on reducing this S&M/Revenue ratio in the next 12-24 months, which would confirm the profitability catalyst?

4.  **Drill Down on the True Cost of the One Key Loyalty Program:**
    *   The bear case highlights "reward devaluation" causing churn. We need to find external data (analyst reports, customer surveys) quantifying the potential **churn rate or decline in high-value customer activity** following the One Key rollout, as this is a key execution risk.

#### **III. Deep Dive on the New Growth Strategy (AI & B2B)**

5.  **Examine the Revenue-Generating Potential of the AI Strategy:**
    *   The new strategy is heavily focused on AI (e.g., the conversational trip planner "Romie" and over 40 new AI features).
    *   **Question:** Are these AI features designed primarily for **cost reduction** (e.g., reducing customer service calls, which was a past issue) or for **direct revenue generation** (e.g., increasing conversion rates)? We need to find management's estimated dollar value of cost savings or revenue uplift from these AI tools.

6.  **Assess the Profitability of the B2B Segment:**
    *   The B2B segment is the highest growth engine (up 18% in a recent quarter), but it typically operates at **lower margins** than the direct-to-consumer lodging business.
    *   **Question:** What are the estimated gross or operating margins for the B2B segment, and how will a larger mix of this lower-margin revenue affect the company's overall consolidated profitability targets (EBITDA margin)?

#### **IV. Valuation and Analyst Sentiment Check**

7.  **Relative Valuation (P/E and EV/EBITDA) to Peers:**
    *   Since the stock is trading near its 52-week high, a lot of future growth and efficiency is priced in.
    *   **Action:** Determine Expedia's current P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios and compare them directly against Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Airbnb (ABNB) to check if the valuation gap reflects its current relative performance.

8.  **Management's Long-Term Financial Targets:**
    *   **Question:** What is the explicit, long-term financial guidance provided by the new CEO, Ariane Gorin (post-May 2024), for revenue growth, EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow conversion, which would allow the investment thesis to be benchmarked?
