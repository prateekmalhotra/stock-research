## Business Summary

RenovoRx, Inc. is a medical device and drug delivery company currently focused on developing treatments for hard-to-treat cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. Instead of delivering chemotherapy drugs through the entire body (systemically), the company is developing a localized method using its proprietary technology, RenovoCath. This specialized catheter is designed to deliver therapeutic agents directly into the diseased tissue or tumor. As the company is still in the phase of running crucial clinical trials, it generates minimal to no commercial revenue. Its core business activity is successfully completing these trials and securing regulatory approval. If approved, its customers will be business-to-business (B2B) clients, specifically hospitals and specialized cancer treatment centers, primarily located in developed economies like the United States, who will purchase the device for use in interventional oncology procedures.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for RenovoRx is the success of its ongoing clinical trials, particularly the Phase III study for pancreatic cancer. Because the company currently has no products generating significant sales, its entire value depends on the clinical data proving the treatment is safe and effective. If the trials fail or regulatory bodies like the FDA do not grant approval, the company will have no viable product to commercialize, which would drastically harm its market position and earnings. This is the primary risk for all clinical-stage medical companies and has historically been the downfall of many. Additionally, a critical near-term financial risk is the need for continuous funding, requiring the company to raise money regularly to pay for trials and operations, which can dilute the value of existing shareholder investments. Long-term risks include competition from larger pharmaceutical companies developing new systemic therapies that might make localized delivery obsolete, and the challenge of convincing hospitals and doctors to adopt a new procedure and device into their existing treatment protocols, known as market adoption risk.

## Company History

RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT) is a life sciences company focused on developing a way to deliver cancer treatments directly to tumors, aiming to improve results for patients with difficult-to-treat solid cancers, such as pancreatic cancer.

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history of the company from its inception to the present day.

### The Foundation and Core Goal (Inception: 2009)

1.  **Inception and Founding Purpose:** RenovoRx was founded in 2009 in California by a team including a physician and an engineer. The core mission was to find a better way to treat solid tumors, particularly those that are hard to reach and often unresponsive to standard treatments like pancreatic cancer.
2.  **The Problem with Standard Care (The "Why"):** Traditional cancer treatment often involves delivering chemotherapy intravenously (through a vein), which circulates throughout the entire body. This method exposes healthy organs to toxic drugs, causing severe side effects, and can struggle to penetrate the dense, protective scar tissue that often forms around tumors like those in the pancreas.
3.  **The Goal:** The company's vision was to solve this dual problem of low drug concentration at the tumor site and high toxicity in the rest of the body by creating a system for targeted drug delivery.

### The Innovative Solution and Technology

4.  **The Core Innovation – RenovoTAMP:** The company developed its proprietary technology, the **RenovoTAMP (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform**. This is a sophisticated method of delivering treatment directly through the artery supplying blood to the tumor.
5.  **The Delivery Device – RenovoCath:** The TAMP platform is enabled by the **RenovoCath**, a unique dual-balloon catheter (a thin, flexible tube). This device is inserted into the artery leading to the tumor, and once in place, the two balloons are inflated to temporarily isolate the blood flow around the tumor.
6.  **How it Works Simply:** This isolation step allows a high concentration of drug, like the chemotherapy gemcitabine, to be infused under pressure. The pressure helps force the drug across the blood vessel wall and directly into the tumor tissue, effectively "bathing" the cancer cells in medicine while minimizing the amount of drug that escapes into the general circulation.

### Key Milestones and Tailwinds (The Advantages)

7.  **Initial Regulatory Approval:** The company achieved an important milestone by securing FDA clearance for the RenovoCath device as a standalone medical device, which can be used by physicians for various procedures involving temporary vessel occlusion and infusion.
8.  **Major Regulatory Tailwind – Orphan Drug Designation:** RenovoRx received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for its first product candidate, a drug-device combination that uses RenovoCath to deliver gemcitabine (known as RenovoGem) to treat pancreatic cancer (2018) and later bile duct cancer (2020).
9.  **Benefit of Orphan Status:** This designation is a huge tailwind, as it is designed to encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. It provides the company with valuable incentives, including potential tax credits for qualified clinical trials, waiving of certain FDA fees, and, most significantly, **seven years of market exclusivity** upon final regulatory approval.
10. **The Pivotal Trial:** The company is currently focused on its most critical project, the Phase III **TIGeR-PaC** clinical trial, which is a large-scale, randomized study comparing the RenovoTAMP therapy against the standard treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).
11. **Positive Clinical Momentum:** The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the interim data from the TIGeR-PaC trial on multiple occasions (including a second interim analysis). They recommended that the company **continue the trial**, which indicates the data is promising and suggests the study is on track to potentially demonstrate improved patient survival.

### Headwinds and Solutions (The Challenges)

12. **The Major Headwind – Financing a Biotech:** As a clinical-stage company focusing on R&D, RenovoRx has historically operated at a loss, which created a financial headwind often referred to as a "going concern" risk. This means there was substantial doubt about having enough cash to continue funding operations and the very expensive Phase III trial.
13. **Solution Through Capital Raising:** To address this, the company successfully raised significant funds through private placements and a public offering in 2024 and 2025, which bolstered its cash position and provided the necessary capital to continue its core mission of advancing the pivotal TIGeR-PaC trial.
14. **Strategic Business Model Shift (The Commercial Solution):** A key innovative solution to the financial headwind was the decision to launch the **RenovoCath device as a standalone commercial product** in late 2024, while simultaneously pursuing the full combination therapy (drug + device) through the clinical trial pathway.
15. **Generating Early Revenue:** This strategic move provided a new and growing source of revenue, generating initial sales in late 2024, and is aimed at generating revenue that can help "reduce its burn rate" (how quickly it uses cash) and support the continued development of the TAMP platform.

### Present Day and Goal

16. **The Current State:** RenovoRx is now a hybrid clinical-stage and commercial-stage company. It is actively selling its FDA-cleared RenovoCath device while also working toward completing its pivotal TIGeR-PaC trial to gain full regulatory approval for its combination therapy, RenovoGem, for pancreatic cancer.
17. **The Ultimate Goal:** The company's ultimate objective remains to revolutionize the treatment of solid tumor cancers, like pancreatic and bile duct cancers, by making therapies more effective and less toxic through the precision of its RenovoTAMP delivery platform.

## Moat Analysis

RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT) is a life sciences company focused on developing a highly specialized, targeted method for delivering cancer therapies. The company’s moat—the barrier that protects its business from competitors—is primarily built on its proprietary technology, strong intellectual property, and a unique position in the treatment of hard-to-reach solid tumors.

### **The RenovoRx Moat: What Makes It Different**

1.  **Proprietary Drug Delivery Platform:** The core differentiator is its patented **RenovoTAMP™ (Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion) therapy platform**, which is enabled by the FDA-cleared **RenovoCath®** device. This system is a unique dual-balloon catheter designed to deliver a high concentration of chemotherapy directly to the tumor via the artery, forcing the drug through the blood vessel wall and into the tissue itself.

2.  **Increased Therapeutic Index and Specialized Niche:** This targeted delivery aims to solve a major problem with standard chemotherapy: it can improve the drug’s effectiveness in the tumor while significantly reducing harmful side effects throughout the body. This approach is particularly effective for "hypovascular" (poorly supplied with blood) tumors, like locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), which are difficult for standard intravenous therapy to reach.

3.  **Strong Intellectual Property (IP) Protection:** The company has built a solid moat of patents, with a portfolio of 19 issued or allowed patents (9 in the U.S.) that protect the TAMP platform and RenovoCath device, with protection extending through 2043. This legal barrier makes it difficult for a competitor to develop and market an identical or very similar targeted delivery system.

### **Special Pricing Power and Market Position**

4.  **Regulatory Market Exclusivity:** The company's lead product candidate, **RenovoGem™** (the device combined with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine), has received **Orphan Drug Designation** for pancreatic and bile duct cancer. This designation provides a significant regulatory advantage: **seven years of market exclusivity** upon its potential FDA approval, creating a strong temporary monopoly.

5.  **Pricing Power Based on Clinical Value:** The business model supports strong pricing power. The company has projected the drug-device combination product could be priced around **$90,000 per treatment**, reflecting the significant survival and quality-of-life benefits demonstrated in clinical trials (e.g., a six-month median survival improvement).

6.  **Favorable Reimbursement Code:** Commercial sales of the standalone RenovoCath device are supported by a new reimbursement code (C9797), which offers approximately **$16,724 per TAMP procedure**. This existing reimbursement mechanism is a critical business factor that encourages adoption by hospitals and clinics.

### **Growth, Displacement Risk, and Stickiness**

7.  **Reason for Growth into a Commercial Company:** RenovoRx has grown by successfully developing and gaining FDA clearance for the **RenovoCath** device, and, most importantly, by generating positive data from its clinical trials (Phase I/II and interim Phase III results), which showed a meaningful improvement in overall survival for a difficult-to-treat cancer. This clinical promise is what has propelled it from a concept to a company with early commercial revenue and a late-stage pivotal trial.

8.  **Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The revenue for the RenovoCath device is recurring because it is a single-use consumable device used per procedure. Furthermore, the company has reported that its initial customers, which include high-volume National Cancer Institute-designated centers, have already placed **repeat purchase orders**, indicating an early sign of a sticky customer base.

9.  **Vulnerability to Displacement by Capital:** While a large company with more capital could attempt to create a competing product, the process would be slow and challenging. The displacement risk is lowered by the company's strong, long-lasting **patent protection** (through 2043) and the **seven-year Orphan Drug market exclusivity** it holds for its lead therapeutic indication upon approval. A competitor would need to develop a non-infringing, equally effective targeted delivery system and fund its own extensive and costly clinical trials.

10. **Investment in R&D and Innovation:** As a life sciences company, its moat fundamentally requires **constant innovation and high R&D investment**. R&D expenses are significant, driven by the ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial and manufacturing development. To maintain its edge, the company is also expanding its platform (the TAMP technology) to treat other solid tumors beyond pancreatic cancer, ensuring its advantage is not limited to a single application.

11. **Soft Network Effects (Data Moat):** The company is actively building a data moat through its **PanTheR Post-Marketing Registry Study**, in which various cancer centers purchase the device to collect real-world safety and efficacy data across a broader range of solid tumors. The more centers that use the device and contribute data, the more informed and valuable the platform becomes for future clinical and commercial use.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on a review of recent news, investor relations releases, and earnings call summaries for RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT), the key catalysts for the stock price are focused on two core areas: the progression of its lead clinical trial and the commercial expansion of its FDA-cleared device.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6–18 Months)

1.  **Completion of Patient Enrollment in Pivotal Trial:** The Phase 3 TIGeR-PaC trial, which evaluates the company's RenovoTAMP therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, is expected to complete patient enrollment in late 2025 or early 2026. This milestone reduces clinical risk and moves the company closer to the final data readout.

2.  **Growth in RenovoCath Device Revenue:** The company has an FDA-cleared device, RenovoCath, which is now being commercialized as a standalone product. The continuation of strong sequential quarterly revenue growth, building on the Q2 2025 revenue of over \$400,000, could demonstrate increasing market adoption and a path toward reducing the company's expenses.

3.  **Expansion of Commercial Network and New Data:** Continued expansion of the customer base, which grew to 13 cancer centers in Q2 2025, and updates from the newly launched PanTheR registry study will show the market's acceptance and potential for new uses of the RenovoCath device in other solid tumors.

### Long-Term Catalysts (18+ Months)

1.  **Positive Final Data from TIGeR-PaC Trial:** The most significant long-term catalyst is the final data readout from the Phase 3 TIGeR-PaC trial, which is triggered after 86 events (deaths) and could potentially lead to FDA approval. Initial interim data was encouraging, showing median overall survival of 16 months for the targeted approach versus 10 months for the standard treatment.

2.  **Potential FDA Approval and Commercialization of RenovoTAMP:** A positive final readout would be followed by a regulatory filing and potential approval for the combination product (RenovoCath with the chemotherapy drug) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Approval would open a major new commercial market, as this product has Orphan Drug Designation, which provides a period of market exclusivity.

3.  **Expansion of Targeted Therapy Pipeline:** The company's underlying Trans-Arterial Micro-Perfusion (TAMP) platform can be used with various drug combinations and in other types of solid tumors, such as metastatic colorectal cancer. Successful results from TIGeR-PaC would validate the platform and create a path for future pipeline development and expansion into other multi-billion-dollar markets.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy

Management has explicitly laid out a dual strategy for stock price growth:

*   **CEO Shaun Bagai on TIGeR-PaC:** The CEO stated that the independent Data Monitoring Committee’s recommendation to **continue the Phase 3 TIGeR-PaC study** is an "expression of confidence in the potential for a positive outcome" for the targeted therapy.
*   **CEO Shaun Bagai on Commercial Strategy:** The strategy is to commercialize the FDA-cleared RenovoCath device simultaneously with the ongoing trial to generate near-term revenue. Management is focused on seeing **"RenovoCath revenues will reduce our burn rate"** and drive shareholder value as they build commercial momentum.
*   **Financial Strategy:** The company has stated that its current cash position is expected to **"fully fund both ongoing RenovoCath scale-up efforts and additional progress towards the completion in the Phase III TIGeR-PaC trial."**

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT)'s recent SEC filings, including the Definitive Proxy Statements (DEF 14A), here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **Low Current Percentage Ownership:** The collective beneficial ownership of common stock by all executive officers and directors as a group is likely a small percentage of total shares outstanding, particularly following multiple capital raises.
*   **Context of Dilution:** As a clinical-stage biotechnology company that frequently raises capital, a low insider ownership percentage is common, as capital raises can significantly dilute the percentage held by early investors and management, thereby reducing their direct financial alignment.
*   **Qualitative Alignment:** Despite the low percentage, the management and board's focus on clinical and commercial milestones (like the Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial) indicates that the value of their holdings is entirely dependent on the future success and value creation of the company, which is aligned with shareholders.

#### **2. Compensation Structure**

*   **Reliance on Variable and Equity Compensation:** The primary components of Named Executive Officer (NEO) compensation include a base salary, an annual performance bonus, and substantial equity awards. This structure ensures that a significant portion of their compensation is "at-risk" and dependent on the company's performance.
*   **Equity-Heavy Long-Term Incentives:** The compensation strategy heavily utilizes equity through options awards and restricted stock/units granted under long-term plans (e.g., the 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan). This means NEOs are incentivized to achieve long-term stock appreciation and clinical/commercial success to realize the value of their awards.
*   **Change-in-Control Incentives:** Non-employee directors are incentivized by a provision for full vesting of their outstanding equity awards upon a change in control. This structure is explicitly designed to encourage a value-maximizing exit (e.g., an acquisition) that would benefit all shareholders.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

*   **Incentivized to Act in Shareholder Interest (Yes, primarily via Equity):** RenovoRx's management team and directors are highly incentivized to act in the best interest of shareholders by maximizing the *future* stock price and achieving key business milestones.
*   **Stock Price and Company Value:** The significant reliance on equity awards (stock options and awards) and the change-in-control vesting clause tie management's personal wealth directly to the successful development of the company's product and its overall valuation, making them directly aligned with long-term shareholder returns.
*   **Minimizing "Lining Pockets" Risk:** While a base salary provides a stable income, the substantial variable component shifts the primary incentive away from simply collecting a fixed paycheck and toward creating stock value.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of the price history and technical indicators for RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT), here is a summary of interesting findings:

1.  **Current Proximity to 52-Week Low:** With a recent closing price of approximately **$0.97** and a 52-week low of **$0.75**, RenovoRx is currently trading approximately **29.33%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis Outlook:** Technical analysis indicators are currently signaling a **negative forecast** for the stock, as it holds "sell signals" from both its short-term and long-term Moving Averages.

3.  **Support and Resistance:** Despite the negative forecast, the stock is currently trading very close to a key **support level** identified by accumulated volume at **$0.96**.

4.  **Significant Recent Price Drop:** The stock has experienced a significant downturn in the short term, falling by over **15%** in the last three months and over **16%** in the last ten days (as of early November 2025).

5.  **Reason for Recent Drop:** The recent decline may be attributed to a general negative momentum and a "sell signal" issued from a pivot top point in early October 2025, which preceded a drop of nearly 28%. Additionally, a recent increase in short interest by over 500% suggests growing bearish investor sentiment.

6.  **Analyst vs. Market Discrepancy:** Despite the poor price performance and negative technical signals, Wall Street analysts have a notably optimistic outlook, with an average price target of **$6.33 to $7.50**, suggesting a substantial upside of over **500%** from the current price.

7.  **Insider Confidence:** Insider sentiment is positive, as insiders have collectively bought more shares than they have sold over the last three months.

8.  **Past Capital Raise:** A major event in early 2025 was the closing of a **$12.1 million public offering** of common stock at $1.05 per share to fund continued progress on its Phase III clinical trial, which initially caused a sharp decline of over 20% upon pricing due to the immediate dilution of existing shares.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for RenovoRx is centered on its dual strategy of near-term commercial revenue generation combined with a potential massive long-term payoff from its clinical trial. In the near term, the company is already successfully selling its specialized delivery device, RenovoCath, to major cancer centers. This growing revenue stream helps cover costs and proves that doctors are willing to adopt the technology. The major long-term driver is the successful completion of the pivotal Phase III clinical trial for pancreatic cancer. If the final trial data confirms the promising interim results (showing improved patient survival), the FDA is likely to approve the targeted drug delivery method. This approval would grant the company seven years of market exclusivity for treating this deadly disease, essentially creating a temporary monopoly in a high-value niche. This clinical success would validate the entire platform, opening the door for the technology to be used for many other solid tumors, driving a huge increase in the company's valuation from its current low stock price.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial will produce positive final results that demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in patient survival compared to standard care. It is also assumed that the FDA will grant regulatory approval for the combination drug-device therapy based on this data, leading to the seven years of market exclusivity. Finally, the company must successfully transition from a clinical-stage company to a commercial entity, meaning hospitals must widely adopt the specialized procedure and the company must effectively scale up the manufacturing and sales of the device.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the holes and faults in the long thesis for RenovoRx, Inc. (RNXT).

## Bear Case Thesis and Critique of Long Thesis

The bull case significantly overstates the certainty of clinical success and the financial impact of current commercial revenue, while minimizing the substantial dilution risk and the fundamental challenges of a high-cost, specialized procedure.

### I. Clinical Trial and Regulatory Risk (The Major Flaw)

1.  **Phase III Success is Not a Certainty, and Interim Data is Not a Final Win:** The bull case's core assumption is that the pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC trial *will* produce positive final results. Clinical trials, especially in oncology with overall survival as the primary endpoint, have a high failure rate, making this a pure binary risk.
2.  **Uncertainty of Interim Data:** While the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended continuing the trial after the second interim analysis (Q2 2025), this is not a confirmation of efficacy. Furthermore, the company electing to **defer publishing the actual data** from the second interim analysis introduces uncertainty, and the first interim analysis showed borderline statistical significance ($p=0.051$) for the suggested overall survival benefit.
3.  **Market Exclusivity is Highly Conditional:** The promised "seven years of market exclusivity" is contingent on receiving New Drug Application (NDA) approval for the drug-device combination (IAG) under its Orphan Drug Designation (ODD). If the final data is not robust enough for the FDA to approve the NDA, the entire long-term payoff from the trial is lost.

### II. Near-Term Revenue and Financial Viability

4.  **"Growing Revenue Stream" is Insufficient for Burn Rate:** The claim of a revenue stream that "helps cover costs" is fundamentally misleading. While RenovoCath device sales are growing (e.g., Q2 2025 revenue of over \$400,000), the company reported a net loss of \$2.9 million in the same quarter, driven by high R\&D and SG\&A expenses. Current revenue is nowhere near sufficient to cover a significant portion of its operating costs.
5.  **Risk of Further Dilution:** Due to the large operating losses, the company is cash-dependent on external funding to complete the high-cost Phase III trial, despite a cash position of \$12.3 million as of June 2025. This necessitates future capital raises via stock offerings, which will significantly dilute current shareholders, counteracting the "low stock price" valuation point in the bull case.
6.  **Uncertainty of Commercial Scaling:** The target of \$400 million in peak annual U.S. sales for the standalone RenovoCath device is based on the company's internal assumptions. Scaling from current minimal revenue to this figure is a major execution challenge, especially since the company was initially attempting this "without a dedicated sales and marketing team" as of Q2 2025.

### III. Commercial and Procedural Hurdles

7.  **Adoption Challenge of a Specialized Procedure:** Widespread hospital adoption is not guaranteed, even with successful trial data. The TAMP procedure is a specialized, interventional radiology technique that requires significant hospital training, new procedural workflows, and specific capital/coding allocations, all of which represent major hurdles to rapid and widespread commercial adoption.
8.  **Competition and Standard of Care:** The company faces competition from continuously evolving systemic chemotherapy agents and other localized delivery methods for pancreatic cancer, a field where the standard of care is constantly improving. The new drug-device combination must not only be statistically superior but also offer a compelling cost-benefit analysis for hospitals and payers.

---

## Next Steps

The existing analysis provides a solid foundation but several key, high-impact financial and clinical questions remain unanswered. The next steps should focus on quantifying the immediate financial risk (dilution) and gaining more granular details on the core clinical catalyst and commercial adoption.

Here are the important questions left unanswered that you should investigate further:

### **I. Financial Risk and Dilution (The "Cash Runway" Problem)**

1.  **Quantify the True Cash Runway:** While management *states* cash on hand (\$12.3M as of June 30, 2025) will "fully fund" the TIGeR-PaC trial, you need to independently verify the implied timeline and risk of further dilution. Based on the net loss of approximately \$2.9 million in Q2 2025 and R&D expenses of \$1.4 million in the same quarter, investigate how long the current cash position can actually fund operations without *any* revenue growth or further capital raises.
2.  **Determine the Profitability of Commercial Sales (Gross Margin):** The bullish case relies on the RenovoCath device's revenue to "reduce the burn rate." Search for information on the **gross margin** of the RenovoCath device to understand the profitability of each sale and the potential for the commercial segment to genuinely offset R&D costs.

### **II. TIGeR-PaC Clinical Trial Details (The Binary Risk)**

3.  **Refine the Final Data Readout Timeline:** The final analysis is triggered by the 86th event (patient death), and as of May 2, 2025, 56 events had occurred. Since the final readout is the major catalyst, model or search for an updated event count and a more precise, official projection for the expected date of the **86th event** and the final data announcement, which will likely be in late 2026 or 2027 based on current progress.
4.  **Investigate the Decision to Defer Interim Data:** The company elected to defer publishing the actual data from the second interim analysis, citing a need to "avoid compromising the integrity of the trial with the FDA". Investigate clinical or regulatory precedents for this action. Was the deferred data *too good* (triggering an early stop for efficacy) or was it *borderline* (making the deferred analysis necessary to protect the study's integrity for the final readout)?
5.  **Examine the Control Arm's Performance:** The trial is comparing RenovoGem to the current standard-of-care, systemic IV administration of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Research recent clinical trial data (2024-2025) for this standard-of-care (control arm) in similar LAPC patient populations to ensure its median survival data (currently 10 months from the first interim analysis) has not improved, which would raise the bar for RenovoGem's success.

### **III. Commercial Adoption and Competitive Landscape**

6.  **Identify and Analyze Direct Competitors:** While the analysis mentions general competition, search for specific companies or devices that use a *localized* or *regional* drug delivery method for pancreatic cancer, such as other forms of Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (IAC), to benchmark RenovoCath's clinical and procedural advantage.
7.  **Investigate Adoption Hurdles and Physician Feedback:** Look for non-company sources (interventional radiology or oncology publications, conference abstracts) that discuss the real-world procedural complexity, setup time, and ease-of-use of the RenovoCath device, which is a key factor in the market adoption risk.
