### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

OPENLANE, Inc. operates in two segments: **Marketplace** (digital vehicle remarketing) and **Finance** (floorplan financing for dealers, through Automotive Finance Corporation - AFC). The core focus and primary growth engine is the asset-light, scalable **Marketplace** segment.

**Business Engine Assumptions (Conservative):**

1.  **Marketplace Segment (Growth Driver):** Management commentary highlights robust dealer-to-dealer (D2D) volume growth, which increased 15% year-over-year in both Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. This D2D growth drives higher-margin auction fees. I will assume this strong initial growth moderates over the projection period.
    *   **2025-2027 (Initial Digital Penetration/Integration):** Maintain a strong, yet slightly tempered growth rate as the digital platform accelerates.
    *   **2028-2030 (Maturity/Macro Normalization):** Transition to a long-term growth rate consistent with a mature digital leader in the used vehicle market.

2.  **Finance Segment (Stable Contributor):** The Finance segment (AFC) is a stable, high-Adjusted EBITDA contributor, whose growth is tied to floorplan originations and is more sensitive to interest rates and vehicle values. I will project a slower, stable growth rate for this segment.

3.  **Revenue Modeling:** The projection uses the FY 2024 Consolidated Revenue of **$1,789 million** as the base.

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate (YoY) | Projected Revenue (millions USD) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | - | **$1,789** | FY 2024 Consolidated Revenue |
| **2025** | 6.0% | **$1,896.34** | Moderation from FY2024 5% YoY growth to reflect strong D2D volumes while remaining conservative. |
| **2026** | 5.0% | **$1,991.16** | Continued strong execution on D2D strategy (15% growth mentioned in Q4 2024) but easing as market competition rises. |
| **2027** | 4.0% | **$2,070.81** | Digital Marketplace nearing full integration potential, growth slows down. |
| **2028** | 3.5% | **$2,143.29** | Long-term growth trending toward GDP/auto industry growth. |
| **2029** | 3.0% | **$2,207.59** | Conservative assumption of stable market growth. |
| **2030** | 3.0% | **$2,273.82** | Conservative assumption of stable market growth. |

### III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

#### A. Net Income Margin

The company is guiding for Operating Adjusted EPS between **$0.90 and $1.00** for 2025. Using the high end of guidance for the 2025 projection:

*   **2025 Net Income (NI) Proxy:** $1.00 EPS * 106.844 million shares = **$106.84 million**
*   **2025 Net Income Margin:** $106.84 million / $1,896.34 million = **5.63%**

Management highlights include Adjusted EBITDA margins of 18% in Q2 2025 for the marketplace, indicating improving profitability and operating leverage. I will project the Net Income Margin to gradually increase from the 2025 guidance, reflecting this anticipated operating leverage.

| Year | Revenue (A) (millions USD) | NI Margin (B) | Base Net Income (C) = A * B (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,896.34 | 5.63% | $106.84 |
| **2026** | $1,991.16 | 6.00% | $119.47 |
| **2027** | $2,070.81 | 6.25% | $129.43 |
| **2028** | $2,143.29 | 6.50% | $139.31 |
| **2029** | $2,207.59 | 6.75% | $149.01 |
| **2030** | $2,273.82 | 7.00% | $159.17 |

#### B. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Compounding

The rule states: Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year, and then a reasonable ROIC is applied to the accumulated net income to get additional income.

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** Given the capital-light nature of the Marketplace segment and management's focus on profitable growth, a modest, conservative positive ROIC of **3.0%** is assumed, as a low single-digit return is reasonable on retained earnings.
*   **Initial NI (from 2024):** FY 2024 Income from continuing operations was $110 million.

| Year | NI from Prior Year's Cash (D) = Accumulated NI (Prev Year) * 3.0% ROIC (millions USD) | Projected Net Income (E) = C + D (millions USD) | Accumulated Net Income (F) = F (Prev Year) + E (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3.30* | **$110.14** | $110.14 |
| **2026** | $3.30 | **$122.77** | $232.91 |
| **2027** | $6.99 | **$136.42** | $369.33 |
| **2028** | $11.08 | **$150.39** | $519.72 |
| **2029** | $15.59 | **$164.60** | $684.32 |
| **2030** | $20.53 | **$179.70** | $864.02 |

*\* Initial accumulated NI is the FY 2024 NI of $110M. The ROIC on this is $110M * 3.0% = $3.30M.*

#### C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The Projected Net Income (E) serves as the "Future Cash Flow" for the DCF calculation.

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **9.0%** (A reasonable rate for a growth-focused company in the cyclical auto market, considering current interest rates and business risk).
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** **2.0%** (A conservative, long-term growth rate, just below expected nominal GDP growth).

| Year | Future Cash Flow (E) (millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $110.14 | 0.9174 | $101.03 |
| **2026** | $122.77 | 0.8417 | $103.34 |
| **2027** | $136.42 | 0.7722 | $105.39 |
| **2028** | $150.39 | 0.7084 | $106.53 |
| **2029** | $164.60 | 0.6499 | $106.97 |
| **2030** | $179.70 | 0.5963 | $107.15 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$635.41** |

**Terminal Value Calculation:**
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$
$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$179.70 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$183.29}{\$0.07} = \$2,618.43 \text{ million}
$$
**NPV of Terminal Value:**
$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})}^{5}} = \frac{\$2,618.43}{{(1 + 0.09)}^{5}} = \$1,701.81 \text{ million}
$$

**Total Net Present Value (Total Equity Value):**
$$
\text{Total NPV} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}
$$
$$
\text{Total NPV} = \$635.41 + \$1,701.81 = \mathbf{\$2,337.22} \text{ million}
$$

### V. Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Price (Approx.) | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$6.30** | **$26.74** | **-76.4%** |

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **$6.30** is significantly lower than the current market price of approximately **$26.74**. This massive discrepancy suggests that **the market is making significantly different, more optimistic assumptions** about OPENLANE's future performance and/or its cost of capital.

**Market's Assumptions (Higher Valuation):**

1.  **Lower Cost of Capital (Discount Rate):** The market might be using a significantly lower discount rate. The nature of a digital platform company often commands a lower long-term WACC/Discount Rate than a traditional auto services business. If the market is modeling a WACC of $\mathbf{7.0\%}$ (instead of $9.0\%$), the Terminal Value and NPV would be much higher, reflecting less risk.
2.  **Higher, More Sustainable Growth Rate:** The market may be factoring in much higher revenue and margin growth beyond 2030. If the market expects the D2D growth to accelerate due to a successful digital transformation, they may be using a Perpetual Growth Rate of $\mathbf{4.0\%}$ or higher (I used 2.0%). This would drastically increase the Terminal Value.
3.  **Net Income vs. Free Cash Flow (FCF) Multiplier:** The market may be valuing the company on an FCF basis which is significantly higher than Net Income. OPENLANE's 2025 CapEx guidance is only $50M-$55M, and 2024 Cash Flow from Operating Activities was $293M. This suggests FCF is substantially higher than Net Income (2024 NI: $110M vs. CFO: $293M). The market is likely valuing the company on a higher FCF stream, which is the key reason for the valuation gap.
4.  **Exclusion of Floorplan Financing Debt:** The market may be *excluding* the $1,796.6 million in **Obligations collateralized by finance receivables** from "Total Debt," arguing it is operational (part of the AFC financing business) rather than a corporate debt liability. If this debt is excluded, the Equity Value would increase by the full debt amount:
    *   **New Equity Value:** $672.72M + $1,796.60M = $\mathbf{\$2,469.32}$ million
    *   **New Fair Value Per Share:** $\$2,469.32 \text{ million} / 106.844 \text{ million shares} = \mathbf{\$23.11}$

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The primary reason my Fair Value is so far below the market price is the **conservative use of Net Income as a proxy for Future Cash Flow** and the **inclusion of the floorplan financing obligations in Total Debt.** If the floorplan obligations are excluded from debt (as they often are for companies with a captive finance arm), the Fair Value per share rises to $\mathbf{\$23.11}$, which is much closer to the market price.

**My Justification for the Conservative Value:**
My valuation remains conservative by using Net Income as a proxy for cash flow and including the floorplan debt in the calculation.
*   **Net Income as FCF Proxy:** While FCF is higher, the rule mandates using Net Income + ROIC. I adhered to the conservative mandate.
*   **Including Floorplan Debt:** Debt is debt. The collateralized obligations are legally liabilities on the balance sheet and represent a significant risk/obligation, warranting its inclusion for a truly conservative valuation. The market is accepting this risk/obligation as purely operational, but an investor should be aware that their equity is subordinate to this huge liability.

The market is fundamentally making a key assumption: **the Floorplan Obligations are operational liabilities that will be fully self-liquidating in the ordinary course of business, rather than a corporate debt obligation.** Adjusting for this assumption largely closes the gap.

### VI. Final Fair Value

**Fair Value per Share (Conservative, as calculated): $6.30**
