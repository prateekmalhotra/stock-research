## Business Summary

Formula One Group acts as the exclusive landlord and promoter for the global Formula 1 racing series. The core business model involves owning and exploiting the commercial rights to the sport. The Group generates revenue primarily by charging three types of businesses: 1) Race Promoters (governments or private entities) pay substantial fees to host a race on their circuit; 2) Media Rights holders (television networks and streaming services worldwide) pay high prices to broadcast the races; and 3) Global Sponsors pay for advertising space on the tracks, cars, and during the broadcasts. While the direct customers are B2B entities like broadcasters and sponsors, the value of the product relies entirely on the global fanbase. This fanbase is traditionally strongest in Europe but has rapidly expanded, especially among younger demographics and key growth regions like the United States, making media and sponsorship rights increasingly valuable.

## Business Model Risk

One significant near-term risk is the heavy dependence on hosting fees from individual race organizers. If races are suddenly canceled due to political instability, local unrest, or health crises, the large fee associated with that event is immediately lost, dramatically harming quarterly earnings. This was clearly demonstrated during the 2020 pandemic when races were canceled or held without paying fans, leading to a substantial temporary loss of the primary revenue stream. A major long-term risk relates to product appeal and competition. F1 relies on exciting, close racing to retain its vast audience. If one specific team achieves prolonged dominance—a recurring historical threat which happened during various eras, leading to viewer apathy—fan engagement may drop. A decline in viewing numbers would reduce the perceived value of the media rights and global sponsorships. Finally, another key long-term threat is relevance. As the global automotive industry shifts aggressively toward electric vehicles, F1 faces the risk of being viewed as a technologically outdated, high-emission sport. This may alienate younger, environmentally conscious fans and potentially cause major corporate sponsors to shift their advertising dollars toward fully electric racing series, severely threatening F1's long-term market position and premium pricing power.

## Company History

The history of the Formula One Group, publicly traded as FWONK, is the story of a dramatic transformation: from a collection of disorganized race events into a centralized, multi-billion-dollar global media and entertainment empire.

Here is a detailed history, broken down by era, of the Formula One Group.

### **The Early Years: The Birth of the Commercial Empire (1970s - 1980s)**

1.  **Inception and Founding Purpose:** The business structure that is today's Formula One Group began with the need to professionalize the sport and secure a stable income for the racing teams.
2.  **The Original Problem (Disorganization):** In the 1970s, Formula 1 was disorganized; each race event made its own deals with promoters and TV stations, which meant team payments were inconsistent, and races were sometimes threatened with boycotts.
3.  **The Founder and First Solution:** Bernie Ecclestone, then a team owner, took the lead in the late 1970s by convincing the teams to "hunt as a pack" and pool their commercial rights.
4.  **The Power Struggle (The FOCA-FISA War):** This move led to a major political conflict in the early 1980s, known as the FISA-FOCA War, where the teams’ union (FOCA) fought the sport’s governing body (FISA/FIA) for control over the prize money and commercial operations.
5.  **The Cornerstone Agreement (Concorde Agreement):** The conflict was resolved with the first of many **Concorde Agreements**, a secret contract between the teams, the governing body, and Mr. Ecclestone's commercial entity. This agreement gave Ecclestone's company the exclusive right to sell the television, sponsorship, and race-hosting rights globally, guaranteeing teams a share of the revenue and their participation in all races.
6.  **The New Business Model:** By centralizing these commercial rights, Mr. Ecclestone transformed Formula 1 into a singular, sellable product, turning a fragmented sport into a cohesive, high-value global property.

### **The Era of Consolidation and Exclusive Focus (1990s - 2016)**

7.  **Private Ownership and Global Expansion:** For decades, Mr. Ecclestone was the CEO, acting as the singular, powerful leader who negotiated deals directly with broadcasters and governments, prioritizing high hosting fees for races in new international markets.
8.  **The Headwind (The Business Model Flaw):** While financially successful, this model under subsequent private equity owners, like CVC Capital Partners (from 2006), faced a critical headwind: the lack of investment in modern fan engagement. The sport had an aging audience, very limited digital media presence, and was seen as too exclusive or technical for a new generation.
9.  **The Problem with Private Equity:** Critics noted that CVC, a private equity firm, was focused on financial returns, extracting money from the business through debt and dividends rather than investing heavily in marketing and digital growth for the future.
10. **The Unspoken Goal of This Era:** The goal was primarily to maximize profit by selling exclusive broadcast rights for the highest price, often leading to races moving to pay-TV and reducing the free-to-air audience.

### **The Modern Era: Liberty Media Acquisition (2017 - Present)**

11. **The Change in Ownership:** In January 2017, the American media and entertainment company **Liberty Media Corporation** (which owns the publicly traded **FWONK** stock) completed the acquisition of the Formula One Group for an enterprise value of $\$8$ billion.
12. **The New Corporate Goal:** Liberty Media's new leadership changed the core mission: to reposition Formula 1 as a premiere **"Entertainment and Media company,"** rather than just a motor racing organization, with fans at the heart of the strategy.
13. **Innovative Solution and Massive Tailwind (Drive to Survive):** In 2019, Liberty Media launched the documentary series *Formula 1: Drive to Survive* on Netflix, a major turning point that offered unprecedented, behind-the-scenes access to the teams and drivers.
14. **The "Drive to Survive" Effect:** This innovative solution was a massive tailwind, transforming the sport by focusing on the drama, rivalries, and personalities. It successfully attracted a much younger and more diverse global audience, especially in the crucial US market, driving ticket sales and viewership records.
15. **Innovative Solution (Financial Stability - The Cost Cap):** To address the long-standing problem of on-track competitive imbalance, Liberty Media introduced a **Cost Cap** (or Budget Cap) on teams starting in 2021. This rule limits the amount of money teams can spend on car development and operations each year (starting at $\$145$ million).
16. **Impact of the Cost Cap:** By preventing the wealthiest teams from outspending all others, the cap has promoted closer racing, increased the overall value of all ten teams, and ensured the financial stability and long-term participation of the smaller teams.

### **Formula One Group (FWONK) Today and its Goal**

17. **Present Day Business:** The Formula One Group generates its primary revenue from three areas: **Race Promotion** (fees paid by countries and circuits to host a Grand Prix, like the new US races in Miami and Las Vegas), **Media Rights** (fees from TV networks and streaming platforms like F1 TV), and **Sponsorship** (global partners like Rolex and Aramco).
18. **The Overarching Goal (The Investor Pitch):** The goal of the Formula One Group today is to leverage the sport's growing global popularity to increase all three revenue streams—securing high-value long-term media contracts, adding new high-profile destination races, and capitalizing on a younger, expanding fanbase to attract premium sponsors.

## Moat Analysis

The Formula One Group (FWONK) possesses a powerful and complex economic moat that goes beyond simple financial muscle, rooted in a unique blend of regulatory control, a deeply entrenched global brand, and a powerful network effect.

Here is an analysis of Formula One's moat:

### 1. Exclusive Commercial and Regulatory Control (The Unassailable Barrier)

*   **Commercial Rights Monopoly:** Formula One Group holds the exclusive, long-term commercial rights to the FIA Formula One World Championship, the highest class of international single-seater auto racing. This means no competitor, regardless of capital, can simply create a rival "Formula One" series.
*   **The Concorde Agreement:** This is a confidential contract between the Formula One Group, the ten F1 teams, and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body. The agreement guarantees that the teams will participate in all races, which ensures a high-quality product for broadcasters and sponsors.
*   **High Barrier to Entry for Competitors:** The combination of exclusive rights and the Concorde Agreement makes it nearly impossible for a new group to form a competing global motorsport series of the same caliber. A new competitor would not only need immense capital but also a decades-long history and the cooperation of all the established teams, circuits, and the governing body.
*   **Team Stability:** The agreement also makes the teams themselves "sticky" partners, as they are contractually obligated to compete, providing revenue stability for FWONK until the current agreement expires in 2025 (with the next one being negotiated to 2030).

### 2. Special Pricing Power and Sticky Contracts

*   **Payer vs. Seller Position:** Unlike many other major sports leagues, Formula One is in the rare position where **race promoters pay F1 a substantial fee** to host a Grand Prix, rather than F1 paying the venue. This gives the Group significant pricing leverage over host cities and tracks, with race promotion fees being a major revenue stream.
*   **Recurring and Sticky Contracts:** The three primary revenue streams—race promotion fees, broadcast/media rights, and sponsorship deals—are typically secured through multi-year contracts, ensuring revenue predictability and a highly recurring business model. The need to be associated with the "pinnacle of motorsport" creates a strong incentive for sponsors to renew.

### 3. Network Effects and Brand Differentiation

*   **Global Entertainment Network Effect:** The popularity of the sport creates a powerful flywheel: **More Fans** (global fan base of over 800 million) $\rightarrow$ **Higher Value** (for media rights and sponsorship) $\rightarrow$ **More Revenue** (for F1 and its teams) $\rightarrow$ **Better Competition/Content** $\rightarrow$ **More Fans**.
*   **"Drive to Survive" Effect:** The Netflix docu-series successfully introduced the sport to a massive new, younger, and more diverse global audience, particularly in the critical US market. This dramatic increase in fan engagement and viewership directly led to higher value media rights deals, demonstrating an exceptional ability to leverage content for business growth.
*   **The Pinnacle of Motorsport:** The brand is differentiated by its unique combination of high-octane racing, cutting-edge technology, and a glamorous, global "world championship" calendar, which is hard to replicate. The sport is associated with "innovation, glamour, and excitement."

### 4. Innovation, R&D, and Displacement Risk

*   **Innovation Without Direct R&D Cost to FWONK:** FWONK itself does not need to invest heavily in R&D to maintain its edge. Instead, the competing F1 teams (like Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull) bear the colossal R&D costs of designing and building their unique, cutting-edge cars.
*   **Constant Innovation is Core to the Product:** The fundamental appeal of F1 is that it is a "race between constructors" and a technology showcase. The constant, multi-billion-dollar R&D rivalry among the teams is the very mechanism that keeps the competition (the product) world-class and differentiated, which FWONK then monetizes.
*   **Displacement is Extremely Difficult:** A well-capitalized competitor cannot easily displace FWONK. The barriers are not just financial, but historical, regulatory (FIA), and structural (Concorde Agreement). Creating a new series with the same historical gravitas, established global fan base, world-class drivers, bespoke cars, and a unified body of world-class teams would likely take decades.

**In summary, Formula One's growth into a global phenomenon is due to its ability to consolidate and exclusively own the commercial rights to a product (the World Championship) that is inherently differentiated by high-cost, high-stakes technological competition, all held together by a unique regulatory contract (the Concorde Agreement) and exponentially expanded by strategic media content like *Drive to Survive*.**

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Liberty Media Corporation's (LMC) filings, which attributes a significant portion of its interests to the Formula One Group (FWONK) tracking stock, the management and incentive structure largely aligns with the interests of long-term shareholders.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Formula One Group (FWONK)

1.  **Insider Ownership (High to Moderate but Significant Control):** The executive leadership's net worth is stated to be significantly tied to Liberty Media. The corporate Chairman, who exerts overall control over LMC, has historically held a substantial beneficial ownership stake in FWONK, which provides a strong foundational alignment of interests with shareholders.
2.  **Tracking Stock Structure & Alignment:** As FWONK is a tracking stock of Liberty Media, its value is intended to reflect the economic performance of the Formula One Group's underlying business, making executive incentives directly dependent on F1's growth and profitability.
3.  **Compensation Philosophy is Stockholder-Centric:** The company's stated philosophy is to "think like owners" and focus on long-term gains, explicitly linking the management team's compensation to the long-term performance of the FWONK stock.
4.  **Emphasis on Long-Term Equity:** A major component of executive compensation is in the form of equity awards (Restricted Stock Units and Options), which often feature extended, multi-year vesting schedules, such as a single vesting tranche on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. This mechanism compels management to focus on sustainable, long-term business value creation rather than short-term gains.
5.  **Performance Metrics Drive Variable Compensation:** The annual cash performance bonuses are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics, which include key financial measures like **Revenue, Adjusted OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization), and Free Cash Flow**. These metrics tie payouts to operational and financial success, directly benefiting the underlying value of the FWONK stock.
6.  **High-Risk, High-Reward Structure:** The structure favors variable, performance-based compensation over a fixed salary, meaning a significant portion of executive pay is "at risk." This high-leverage compensation model creates a strong incentive for executives to aggressively pursue strategic goals that will generate shareholder return.

### Conclusion

Management for the Formula One Group appears to have **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

The combination of long-term, multi-year stock-based compensation (which forces a long-term outlook), a compensation structure linked to shareholder-friendly financial metrics (Adjusted OIBDA and Free Cash Flow), and the significant ownership/control held by the ultimate corporate chairman creates a strong alignment between management's financial interests and the long-term appreciation of the FWONK stock value. The focus on long-term equity vesting and performance-based variable pay mitigates the incentive to simply "line their own pockets" with short-term manipulation.

## Long Thesis

Formula One Group (FWONK) holds an unshakeable, global monopoly over the world's most popular motorsport, which it is rapidly monetizing by transforming the sport into a premier entertainment product. Driven by the success of the Netflix series 'Drive to Survive', F1 has attracted millions of new, younger fans, especially in the crucial US market. In the near term, this surging global demand allows F1 to demand much higher prices for its primary revenue streams: media rights (TV deals), global sponsorships, and the fees paid by cities to host a race (like Miami and Las Vegas). Management is executing a strategy to maximize this pricing power by securing new, highly profitable, long-term contracts. Long term, the bull case rests on the company's powerful economic moat, its ability to keep the racing exciting through spending limits (cost cap), and the massive growth opportunity presented by applying its proven monetization model to a second global property, the newly acquired MotoGP motorcycle racing series. This creates a stable business with highly predictable, accelerating revenue growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The underlying success of the business depends on the following: 1) The on-track racing must remain competitive, avoiding long periods where a single team dominates and bores the audience. 2) F1 must successfully monetize its new, younger fan base and continue its rapid growth in the United States. 3) F1 must continue to command strong pricing power, meaning broadcasters and race promoters must be willing to accept significantly increased fees during future contract renewals. 4) The acquisition and integration of MotoGP must successfully replicate the F1 growth model, driving viewership and revenue for the new asset. 5) Management must successfully execute the complex operations and economics of high-profile events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

## Bear Case Scenario

## Bear Case: Flaws and Risks in the Formula One Group (FWONK) Long Thesis

The long thesis is vulnerable to a "growth plateau" risk, particularly in its most critical growth market (the US), and is exposed to significant operational and regulatory hurdles that could dilute its premium brand and absorb capital without guaranteed returns.

### Flaws in Near-Term Monetization and US Growth

1.  **US Viewership Growth is Plateauing, Threatening Media Rights Pricing Power:** The thesis's core assumption of "rapid growth in the United States" is challenged by flat average viewership, which has remained relatively stable at 1.1 to 1.2 million viewers per race since 2022. This stagnation weakens F1's negotiating leverage for the upcoming U.S. media rights deal after 2025, where the company is reportedly seeking a massive price hike (up to double the current fee), which media companies have been described as "lukewarm" on.

2.  **Sponsorship and Media Rights Revenue Conflict:** There is an inherent conflict in maximizing revenue from exclusive media rights (paywalls, like F1 TV) while also maximizing exposure for global sponsors; increasing paywall revenue can cap the total addressable audience for sponsors, which may temper their willingness to accept continuous, substantial sponsorship fee increases.

3.  **High-Cost Race Execution Risk:** The strategy relies heavily on expensive, high-profile new races like Las Vegas, which carry "real execution risks," including the complexity and cost of temporary street circuits and the possibility of not meeting expectations, which can strain resources and potentially tarnish the premium brand image. While management has successfully raised race promotion fees by leveraging demand and calendar scarcity, the high cost of hosting can lead to a delicate balance for promoters, particularly as the calendar is nearing its maximum capacity of 24 races.

### Flaws in Long-Term Economic Moat and Competitive Stability

4.  **Cost Cap Loopholes Threaten Competitive Balance:** While the cost cap aims to keep racing exciting, it is not a perfect shield against competitive dominance; wealthier teams can exploit loopholes by allocating key personnel to non-F1 projects (like road car divisions or side projects), allowing them to retain top talent and high-level IP development outside the cap's financial constraints, which maintains an underlying spending advantage. This risks a return to long periods of single-team dominance, which the long thesis explicitly identifies as a factor that "bores the audience."

5.  **The Cost Cap's Ambiguous Impact on Competition:** Despite its introduction, empirical research has found that the cost cap's effect on increasing competitive balance has been ambiguous and difficult to definitively prove, suggesting the core issue of a non-level playing field may not be resolved by financial rules alone, especially when major technical regulation changes can reset the competitive order.

### Flaws in the MotoGP Growth Catalyst

6.  **Significant Regulatory Risk Could Torpedo the MotoGP Acquisition:** The growth story centered on a "second global property" is highly contingent on the successful closing of the MotoGP acquisition, which is currently facing an in-depth "Phase 2" investigation by European Union antitrust regulators due to concerns over anti-competitive effects in broadcasting and streaming. This regulatory hurdle is significant, has historical precedent (CVC was forced to divest MotoGP in 2006 to acquire F1), and could lead to major delays, mandated divestitures (remedies), or the entire deal's collapse, eliminating the "massive growth opportunity."

7.  **MotoGP is a Less-Premium, Niche Sport with Integration Risks:** Even if the deal closes, two-wheel racing like MotoGP is considered by some analysts to be a "much more of a niche sport" compared to F1, which may limit the success of simply replicating F1's premium monetization model. Furthermore, the acquisition will consolidate pre-existing MotoGP debt, adding leverage to the balance sheet, and there are limited synergies, as shared logistics are difficult and cross-promotion is the primary benefit.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your extensive analysis, several critical questions remain unanswered, particularly those related to the most significant growth catalysts and risks you identified.

Here are the next steps and important questions to investigate further, focusing on the valuation and the binary risks that could dramatically alter the investment thesis:

### 1. Resolve Major Long-Term Risk/Catalyst (MotoGP Acquisition)

*   **Question:** What is the final status of the high-stakes European Union antitrust review of the MotoGP acquisition?
*   **Next Step:** The bear case cited a Phase 2 investigation with the risk of collapse. New information is needed to confirm if the acquisition has been approved, failed, or if remedies were imposed. If approved, the analyst should investigate the integration plan and the associated debt impact.

*Update from Search:* The European Commission unconditionally approved Liberty Media's acquisition of Dorna Sports (MotoGP) on June 23, 2025, following a Phase II investigation. This approval is significant because the Commission departed from a 2006 precedent where a similar merger was only cleared on the condition of a MotoGP divestment, thus removing a major regulatory risk. **This effectively shifts the MotoGP acquisition from a major risk (bear case) to a confirmed long-term catalyst (long thesis), making the risk of collapse negligible.**

### 2. Address Core Profitability Risk (Concorde Agreement)

*   **Question:** What are the key commercial terms of the newly signed 2026-2030 Concorde Agreement and how will it impact FWONK's profitability margins?
*   **Next Step:** The analysis noted the current agreement expires at the end of 2025. Search results indicate that Formula 1 and all ten (now eleven) teams signed the commercial agreement in March 2025. Investigate the specifics of the new agreement, particularly any reported changes to the profit-sharing structure, which could raise the teams' percentage of commercial revenue and reduce FWONK's operating income (OIBDA) margin.

*Action:* Search results show the commercial part of the new Concorde Agreement (2026-2030) has been signed by all teams. It is believed the teams will receive a slightly larger share of the prize money, and there will be a new anti-dilution fee for new teams (reportedly $450 million for Cadillac), which will benefit the existing teams. Further details on the exact split are still needed.

### 3. Justify Premium Valuation with Comparable Analysis

*   **Question:** How does FWONK's current valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.) compare to its most relevant sports and media peers (e.g., Manchester United, WWE/TKO Group, Live Nation, major broadcasters)?
*   **Next Step:** The stock is near its 52-week high, suggesting a premium. To justify the "Strong Buy" technical outlook, a fundamental valuation analysis is required. Determine the key multiples the market is applying and confirm if this premium is warranted by the faster projected growth rate compared to its peers.

### 4. Validate US Growth Thesis (Media Rights Negotiation)

*   **Question:** What is the specific, verifiable status of the US Media Rights contract negotiation (post-2025) and who is the current frontrunner (Apple, ESPN, etc.)?
*   **Next Step:** The bear case hinges on a "lukewarm" response from US media companies to FWONK's price hike demand, which is a major threat to the revenue growth engine. Investigate recent press releases or reliable financial journalism to confirm whether FWONK's aggressive asking price is being met or if a potential deal (like the rumored Apple bid) is being finalized, which would be a massive catalyst.

### 5. Assess Long-Term Environmental/Competitive Headwind

*   **Question:** What is the capital expenditure (CapEx) or R&D investment required for F1's "net-zero carbon footprint by 2030" plan, and how does the competitive landscape with Formula E and other motorsports look?
*   **Next Step:** The business model risk section mentions the environmental threat and the long-term risk of technological relevance. Investigate the projected financial cost of the *Sustainable Racing* plan to ensure it does not absorb an unexpectedly large amount of Free Cash Flow, and verify the market's perception of Formula E as a viable threat to F1's sponsorship base.
