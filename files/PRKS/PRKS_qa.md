## Business Summary

United Parks & Resorts Inc. operates a portfolio of theme parks and water parks, primarily attracting local and regional families with children, as well as tourists. Its core business model revolves around selling admission tickets, both single-day and season passes, which represent a significant portion of its revenue. Additional revenue streams include food and beverage sales, merchandise, in-park attractions, and sponsorships. The company's operations depend on creating engaging experiences that encourage repeat visitation and drive ancillary spending within its parks.

## Business Model Risk

Near-term risks include adverse weather conditions that can deter visitors and impact attendance, as well as unexpected maintenance issues or ride downtime that diminish the guest experience. Long-term risks involve increased competition from other entertainment venues, changes in consumer spending habits, and the potential for economic downturns to reduce discretionary spending on leisure activities. Furthermore, the company faces risks related to maintaining the appeal and safety of its attractions, as well as the need for continuous investment in new rides and experiences to remain competitive, a challenge that has historically required significant capital expenditure and can be hampered by economic conditions. The seasonality of the business also poses a risk, as revenue is heavily concentrated in warmer months, making the company vulnerable to disruptions during its peak season.

## Company History

Here is a history of United Parks & Resorts Inc., formerly known as SeaWorld Entertainment:

### Inception and Founding Vision

1.  **The Genesis of SeaWorld:** The story of United Parks & Resorts Inc. begins in 1964 with the founding of SeaWorld by George Millay, Milt Shedd, Ken Norris, and David DeMott. The initial concept was to create an underwater restaurant, but it evolved into a marine zoological park. The first SeaWorld park opened in San Diego, California, on 21 acres along Mission Bay.
2.  **Core Idea:** The founders envisioned a place where people could experience marine life up close, combining education with entertainment. The goal was to inspire guests to learn about and care for the natural world.
3.  **Early Success:** The original SeaWorld park in San Diego was an immediate success, drawing over 400,000 visitors in its first year with an initial investment of $1.5 million. This success paved the way for expansion.

### Growth and Evolution

1.  **Expansion of SeaWorld:** Following the success in San Diego, SeaWorld opened its second location in Aurora, Ohio, in 1970. The third park was established in Orlando, Florida, in 1973, capitalizing on the growing popularity of Florida as a tourist destination and the success of Walt Disney World. SeaWorld San Antonio followed in 1988.
2.  **Acquisition of Busch Gardens:** The company's roots also extend to Busch Gardens, which began in 1959 as a small bird sanctuary and garden adjacent to an Anheuser-Busch brewery in Tampa, Florida. Busch Gardens expanded to include zoological attractions and thrill rides. In 1989, Busch Entertainment Corporation, the theme park division of Anheuser-Busch, acquired the SeaWorld parks. This brought SeaWorld and Busch Gardens under the same corporate umbrella.
3.  **Introduction of Sesame Place:** Sesame Place, a theme park dedicated to the spirit of Sesame Street, was developed to further enhance family entertainment offerings, sharing SeaWorld's philosophy of education through entertainment.
4.  **Blackstone's Acquisition and Rebranding:** In 2009, the Blackstone Group acquired Busch Entertainment Corporation and renamed it SeaWorld Entertainment. In January 2024, the company officially changed its corporate name to United Parks & Resorts Inc.. This rebranding reflects its broader portfolio of brands and parks beyond just SeaWorld.

### Challenges and Innovations

1.  **The "Blackfish" Controversy:** A significant challenge arose in 2013 with the release of the documentary "Blackfish," which criticized SeaWorld's treatment of orcas, particularly the killer whale Tilikum. This led to widespread protests and negative publicity, impacting the company's reputation and attendance.
2.  **Shift in Animal Encounters:** In response to public concern and the "Blackfish" controversy, SeaWorld phased out its orca breeding program and altered its orca shows, moving towards more educational presentations about the animals' natural behaviors. This was an innovative solution to adapt to changing public sentiment and animal welfare standards.
3.  **Focus on Thrill Rides and Diversification:** To reduce reliance on marine mammal shows and broaden its appeal, the company invested heavily in new rides and attractions, including roller coasters, across its parks. This diversification helped attract a wider audience.
4.  **Pandemic Impact and Recovery:** Like many entertainment venues, United Parks & Resorts faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, with temporary closures and reduced attendance. However, the company saw a strong recovery as travel restrictions eased and people sought out leisure activities.
5.  **Operational and Financial Headwinds:** In recent years, the company has faced headwinds such as inflation, labor issues, and fluctuating consumer demand, leading to increased operating expenses and pressure on profit margins. They have also experienced declines in per capita spending in certain areas, despite efforts to boost in-park spending.

### Tailwinds and Continued Growth

1.  **Strong Brand Portfolio:** United Parks & Resorts manages a diverse portfolio of well-recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Sesame Place, Discovery Cove, and Aquatica. This diversified brand portfolio provides resilience and broad market appeal.
2.  **Geographic Diversification:** With parks located in various key markets across the United States and an international presence in Abu Dhabi, the company is well-positioned to capture diverse customer bases.
3.  **Animal Welfare and Conservation:** The company emphasizes its role as a leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, and veterinary care, and its commitment to rescuing and rehabilitating animals. This focus on conservation and animal rescue serves as a positive differentiator.
4.  **Barriers to Entry:** The theme park industry has significant barriers to entry, including the need for large tracts of land, complex permitting processes, and high capital expenditures, which benefits established players like United Parks & Resorts.
5.  **Real Estate Holdings:** The company owns substantial real estate, which presents opportunities for future development, such as hotels, and can provide additional value.

### The Goal of United Parks & Resorts

The overarching goal of United Parks & Resorts Inc. is to provide "experiences that matter," inspiring guests to celebrate, connect with, and care for the natural world. This is achieved through a blend of thrilling rides, engaging shows, and educational presentations that highlight the company's commitment to zoological collections, animal welfare, and conservation. They aim to be a leading force in the entertainment industry while also contributing positively to animal welfare and conservation efforts worldwide.

## Moat Analysis

## United Parks & Resorts Inc. (PRKS): Analyzing Its Moat and Competitive Advantages

United Parks & Resorts Inc., formerly SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., operates a portfolio of theme parks and entertainment venues, primarily under the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens brands. The company's "moat"—its sustainable competitive advantage—stems from several key factors that differentiate it from competitors and make it difficult to displace.

Here's an analysis of its moat:

1.  **Differentiated and Iconic Brands:**
    *   United Parks & Resorts owns and operates well-known brands like SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, which have significant recognition and appeal globally. These brands evoke specific experiences, from marine life encounters to thrilling rides, creating an emotional connection with consumers.
    *   The company also leverages intellectual property from partners like Sesame Street, further broadening its appeal, especially to families with young children.

2.  **Unique Combination of Attractions:**
    *   The company's parks offer a distinctive blend of animal encounters, educational exhibits, and high-thrill rides and shows. This combination is not easily replicated by competitors who might focus solely on rides or on animal exhibits.
    *   SeaWorld's expertise in animal care, conservation, and training is a significant differentiator. This includes a long history of animal rescue and rehabilitation, which enhances its brand image and appeals to a growing segment of socially conscious travelers.

3.  **Extensive Park Portfolio and Geographic Reach:**
    *   United Parks & Resorts operates 12 parks across the United States, including highly attended theme parks and water parks. This broad presence allows it to cater to diverse regional markets.
    *   The strategic location of these parks in popular tourist destinations also contributes to their accessibility and drawing power.

4.  **Pricing Power and In-Park Spending:**
    *   The unique nature of its attractions and strong brands give the company a degree of pricing power. It can implement dynamic pricing strategies, including peak season pricing and tiered pass options, to optimize revenue.
    *   There's a strong focus on increasing in-park spending through food, merchandise, and other ancillary offerings, which has shown consistent growth. This high-margin revenue stream is a key factor in its profitability.

5.  **Customer Loyalty and Recurring Revenue:**
    *   The company actively cultivates customer loyalty through season pass programs and other membership initiatives. These programs encourage repeat visits and create a more predictable revenue stream.
    *   Recent efforts, like the enhanced annual pass programs, aim to further lock in customers and build recurring revenue.

6.  **Barriers to Entry:**
    *   The theme park industry has significant barriers to entry, including the need for vast amounts of land in desirable locations, complex permitting processes, and substantial capital expenditure for developing new attractions. Building a park of comparable scale and quality would require immense investment and time.
    *   The expertise in animal management and conservation is also a difficult asset for new entrants to replicate.

**What Makes it Different from Competitors?**

*   **Animal Expertise:** While competitors like Cedar Fair and Six Flags focus heavily on rides and roller coasters, United Parks & Resorts maintains a core identity around marine life and animal conservation. This allows it to offer a unique educational and conservation-focused experience that appeals to a specific audience.
*   **Brand Synergy:** The combination of SeaWorld's animal focus with Busch Gardens' thrill rides and diverse animal habitats creates a unique park experience that competitors often cannot match.
*   **Rescue and Conservation Efforts:** The company's significant investment in animal rescue and rehabilitation differentiates it from entertainment-focused competitors and appeals to a growing conscious consumer base.

**Reason for Growth and How Easily it Can Be Displaced:**

The company's growth into a major player is due to its strategic acquisition and development of these iconic parks, its focus on creating unique guest experiences, and its ability to leverage its brands. Its strong brand recognition, differentiated offerings, and the high capital costs associated with establishing new parks create significant barriers to entry, making it difficult for new competitors with more capital to displace it quickly.

**Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:**

Customers and contracts are becoming increasingly "sticky" due to the company's focus on season passes and loyalty programs, which generate recurring revenue. While individual park visits can be one-time events, the pass programs encourage repeat engagement throughout the year.

**Actions to Ensure a Solid Moat:**

*   **Investing in New Attractions:** The company consistently invests in new rides and attractions to keep the offerings fresh and exciting, driving repeat visits and attracting new guests.
*   **Focus on In-Park Spending:** Enhancing dining, merchandise, and other ancillary revenue streams diversifies income and improves profitability.
*   **Leveraging Brands and IP:** Utilizing well-known brands like Sesame Street and exploring licensing opportunities expands reach and appeal.
*   **Commitment to ESG:** Emphasizing animal welfare, conservation, and sustainability appeals to a growing segment of consumers and investors.
*   **Capital Allocation:** Strategic share repurchases and efficient capital expenditure management aim to enhance shareholder value and demonstrate financial strength.

**Network Effects and Other Advantages:**

While not a traditional network effect business, the brand's widespread recognition and positive word-of-mouth can create a self-reinforcing cycle of popularity. The extensive experience in animal care and zoological knowledge is a rare and valuable asset that builds trust and credibility.

**R&D and Innovation:**

United Parks & Resorts does invest in innovation, focusing on developing new attractions, improving park operations, and enhancing guest experiences. While not a traditional R&D-heavy tech company, continuous innovation in ride technology, themed entertainment, and guest services is crucial for maintaining its competitive edge in the entertainment industry.

## Catalyst Analysis

Here are some catalysts that could positively impact United Parks & Resorts Inc. (PRKS) stock price in the near and long term:

### Near-Term Catalysts:

1.  **Aggressive Share Repurchases:** United Parks & Resorts has authorized a significant $500 million share repurchase program.

Such buybacks can reduce the number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) and driving up the stock price.
2.  **Inclusion in S&P SmallCap 600 Index:** The company's inclusion in this index is expected to attract passive buying demand from index-tracking funds and ETFs. This increased demand can lead to a short-term boost in the stock price due to the need for these funds to adjust their portfolios.
3.  **Strong Cash Flow Generation:** The company is generating robust free cash flow, which provides the financial flexibility to execute share buybacks and reinvest in the business. This financial strength is a positive signal to investors and can support the stock price.
4.  **New Attraction Launches and Special Events:** The company consistently introduces new rides and attractions, and its popular seasonal events (like Halloween and Christmas) are expected to drive attendance and revenue growth. Positive reception to these offerings can lead to increased visitor numbers and higher sales.

### Long-Term Catalysts:

1.  **Record EBITDA and Revenue Growth:** Management projects record revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2025, a continuation of a trend of significant EBITDA growth since 2019. This sustained operational and financial improvement is a strong indicator of long-term value creation.
2.  **Strategic Partnerships and Sponsorships:** The company is actively pursuing sponsorship deals and exploring ways to monetize its real estate assets. Successful partnerships and monetization efforts can create new revenue streams and enhance profitability.
3.  **Growth in Group and International Ticket Bookings:** Favorable trends in group and international ticket sales suggest a broadening customer base and potential for sustained attendance growth. These bookings are trending ahead of prior years, indicating positive momentum.
4.  **Continued Focus on Animal Welfare and Conservation:** As a leader in zoological organizations and animal welfare, the company's commitment to conservation and rehabilitation efforts resonates with a growing segment of consumers. This can enhance brand reputation and attract environmentally conscious visitors.
5.  **Potential REIT Conversion:** While not explicitly confirmed as a current strategy, a potential Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) conversion has been mentioned as a possible catalyst for upside. Such a move could unlock value by separating real estate assets from operations.

**Management Commentary:**

In recent earnings calls, management has expressed strong confidence in the company's performance and future prospects. CEO Marc Swanson highlighted the company's strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation as key reasons for the share repurchase program, viewing it as an attractive investment opportunity.

    *   However, some sources indicate significantly higher insider ownership percentages, with one stating 227.28% and another mentioning Hill Path Capital Partners LP (an insider entity) holding 49.71% of the company's shares.

## Long Thesis

United Parks & Resorts (PRKS) has a strong bull case driven by its unique brand portfolio (SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Sesame Place) and differentiated offerings that combine animal encounters with thrilling rides. The company benefits from significant barriers to entry in the theme park industry, such as high capital costs and land acquisition, which protect its market position. Management's focus on operational improvements, cost efficiencies, and strategic investments in new attractions is expected to drive attendance and in-park spending. Aggressive share repurchase programs, supported by strong free cash flow generation, indicate management's confidence in the company's undervaluation and their commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In the near term, catalysts like potential inclusion in the S&P SmallCap 600 index and successful seasonal events could boost the stock. Long term, continued revenue and EBITDA growth, successful strategic partnerships, and leveraging its robust real estate holdings for potential development or even a REIT conversion, position PRKS for sustained value creation. The company's emphasis on animal welfare and conservation also appeals to a growing segment of environmentally conscious consumers, further solidifying its brand appeal.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case for United Parks & Resorts (PRKS) relies on several key assumptions: 1. Continued economic stability and consumer discretionary spending on leisure activities, as theme parks are a non-essential expense. 2. The absence of major unforeseen events such as severe weather disruptions, pandemics, or significant negative PR incidents that could impact attendance and operations. 3. Management's ability to successfully execute its strategic initiatives, including the development and launch of new attractions, and to control costs effectively in an inflationary environment. 4. The continued effectiveness of share repurchase programs in boosting shareholder value and the ability to fund them through strong free cash flow. 5. The assumption that competition from other entertainment venues will not significantly erode PRKS's market share or pricing power. 6. The company's ability to maintain and enhance its brand reputation, particularly concerning animal welfare and conservation efforts, to align with evolving consumer expectations. 7. The market recognizing the intrinsic value of the company's real estate assets and potential for future development or strategic restructuring (e.g., REIT conversion). 8. Favorable interest rate environment that supports consumer spending and potentially reduces the cost of capital for future investments.

## Bear Case Scenario

Here's a critique of the provided bull case for United Parks & Resorts (PRKS), along with a bear case thesis:

## Critique of the Bull Case Thesis

1.  **Brand Portfolio Diversification vs. Cannibalization:** While the unique brand portfolio is cited as a strength, there's a potential risk of cannibalization between brands or a lack of clear differentiation that might dilute brand appeal and marketing effectiveness. For instance, the overlap in target demographics between SeaWorld and Busch Gardens could lead to less efficient marketing spend.
2.  **Barriers to Entry Not Absolute:** The "significant barriers to entry" are acknowledged, but these can be overcome by well-capitalized competitors or emerging entertainment forms that offer lower overhead and potentially higher novelty. The rise of unique, smaller-scale entertainment experiences could present a threat.
3.  **Execution Risk on Strategic Initiatives:** Relying heavily on management's ability to execute is a weakness. Developing and launching new attractions is capital-intensive and carries inherent risks of delays, cost overruns, and failure to meet guest expectations, especially in a competitive market.
4.  **Share Repurchases and Free Cash Flow Sustainability:** While share repurchases signal confidence, they can be unsustainable if free cash flow falters due to economic downturns or increased operational costs. Aggressive buybacks might also come at the expense of reinvestment in park infrastructure or new attractions, hindering long-term growth.
5.  **Seasonal Events and Index Inclusion as Short-Term Catalysts:** Over-reliance on seasonal events and potential index inclusion as near-term catalysts can lead to volatility and may not reflect fundamental long-term value. Once these events pass or the index inclusion occurs, the stock might lack further immediate catalysts.
6.  **REIT Conversion Uncertainty:** The potential REIT conversion of real estate holdings is highly speculative. Such a move involves complex regulatory hurdles, significant tax implications, and requires market appetite for such a structure, which may not materialize.
7.  **Animal Welfare Scrutiny:** Despite the emphasis on animal welfare, the company has faced past controversies and ongoing scrutiny regarding its animal parks. Negative press or activist campaigns could significantly damage brand appeal and deter consumers, regardless of stated conservation efforts.
8.  **Economic Sensitivity and Discretionary Spending:** The assumption of continued economic stability and consumer discretionary spending is a major vulnerability. Theme parks are highly sensitive to economic downturns, inflation, and rising interest rates, which can reduce disposable income for leisure activities.

## Bear Case Thesis for United Parks & Resorts Inc. (PRKS)

1.  **Intense Competition and Evolving Entertainment Landscape:** PRKS faces significant competition not only from other theme park operators but also from a growing array of alternative entertainment options, including digital entertainment, experiential retail, and other leisure activities, which are often more affordable and accessible. This broad competition can erode market share and pricing power.
2.  **High Capital Intensity and Maintenance Costs:** The theme park industry is inherently capital-intensive, requiring continuous investment in new rides, attractions, and maintaining existing infrastructure. Inflationary pressures on materials, labor, and energy can significantly increase operational and capital expenditure, squeezing margins.
3.  **Vulnerability to Economic Downturns and Inflation:** As a discretionary spending business, PRKS is highly susceptible to economic slowdowns, recessions, and periods of high inflation, which reduce consumer disposable income and willingness to spend on non-essential activities like theme park visits.
4.  **Brand Reputation Risks and Animal Welfare Scrutiny:** Despite efforts, the company's association with animal parks continues to attract scrutiny and potential negative publicity from animal welfare groups and the general public. Any perceived misstep or controversy can severely damage brand image and consumer trust, impacting attendance.
5.  **Execution Risk of Growth Strategies:** The success of PRKS's growth strategy relies heavily on the effective execution of new attraction development and operational efficiencies. Delays, cost overruns, or underperformance of new attractions can lead to significant financial setbacks and impact investor confidence.
6.  **Limited Diversification and Geographic Concentration:** The company's portfolio, while unique, is primarily focused on theme parks. This lack of diversification makes it vulnerable to localized issues, such as regional economic weakness or natural disasters, impacting attendance and revenue.
7.  **Debt Load and Interest Rate Sensitivity:** While the bull case mentions free cash flow, the company may carry a significant debt load to finance its capital-intensive operations. Rising interest rates can increase the cost of servicing this debt, reducing profitability and cash available for shareholder returns or reinvestment.
8.  **Uncertainty of Real Estate Monetization:** The potential for leveraging real estate assets, including a REIT conversion, is a highly speculative and long-term strategy. There is no guarantee that these assets can be monetized effectively or that market conditions will be favorable for such a restructuring.
