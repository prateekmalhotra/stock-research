### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for United Parks & Resorts (PRKS) is driven by two key variables: **Attendance** (number of guests) and **Total Revenue Per Capita** (Admissions Per Capita + In-Park Per Capita Spending).

*   **FY 2024 Actuals:** Attendance was $21.5$ million guests, with Total Revenue Per Capita of $\$80.07$.
*   **Recent Trends:** Q2 2025 saw Total Revenue Per Capita decrease by $2.2\%$ year-over-year, and Admissions Per Capita fell by $3.9\%$. The company's management attributed this to calendar shifts and lower realized pricing on certain products.
*   **Management Guidance:** Despite the Q1 and Q2 weakness, management has expressed *confidence in achieving record annual revenue and EBITDA for 2025*, citing new attractions and a strong April attendance.

#### Conservative Business Engine Assumptions

To adhere to the rule of being **conservative** while incorporating management's positive guidance, the following assumptions are used:

1.  **2025 Revenue Estimate:** Management guides for "record revenue." A conservative record implies a minimal increase over FY 2024 revenue of $\$1,725.3 \text{ million}$.
    *   **2025 Revenue Projection:** **$1,760.0$ million** (approx. $2.0\%$ growth over 2024). This is conservative, acknowledging the first-half struggles while granting that new attractions may drive a better second half.

2.  **Long-Term Growth (2026-2030):** The company's strategy involves continued investment in new rides and animal habitats (new attractions), which should drive both attendance and pricing power.
    *   **Attendance Growth (Conservative):** **$1.0\%$ per year**. This is a steady, conservative growth rate, acknowledging the business is mature and highly susceptible to weather and macro/travel trends.
    *   **Total Revenue Per Capita Growth (Conservative):** **$1.5\%$ per year**. This assumes the company will manage to slightly increase pricing and in-park spending, even in a competitive market, driven by price increases on annual passes and premium in-park experiences.

#### Projected Revenue

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions USD) | Calculation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $1,725.3$ | Actual FY 2024 Result |
| **2025** | $1,760.0$ | $2.0\%$ growth (Conservative 'Record Revenue' Guidance) |
| **2026** | $1,804.0$ | $1,760.0 \times (1.01 \times 1.015)$ = $1,760.0 \times 1.025$ |
| **2027** | $1,849.1$ | $1,804.0 \times 1.025$ |
| **2028** | $1,895.3$ | $1,849.1 \times 1.025$ |
| **2029** | $1,942.7$ | $1,895.3 \times 1.025$ |
| **2030** | $1,991.3$ | $1,942.7 \times 1.025$ |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

#### Margin Assumptions

*   **FY 2024 Net Income Margin:** $227.5 \text{ million} / \$1,725.3 \text{ million} = 13.18\%$.
*   **Projected Net Income Margin:** The company operates a high-fixed-cost business. A modest increase in revenue should lead to margin expansion due to operating leverage and "operational efficiencies" cited by management.
    *   **2025 - 2030:** I will conservatively project a gradual Net Income Margin expansion from $13.5\%$ in 2025 to a stable $15.0\%$ by 2030.

| Year | Projected Revenue (Millions USD) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,760.0$ | $13.5\%$ | $237.6$ |
| **2026** | $1,804.0$ | $13.9\%$ | $250.7$ |
| **2027** | $1,849.1$ | $14.3\%$ | $264.5$ |
| **2028** | $1,895.3$ | $14.6\%$ | $276.7$ |
| **2029** | $1,942.7$ | $14.9\%$ | $289.9$ |
| **2030** | $1,991.3$ | $15.0\%$ | $298.7$ |

#### ROIC and Future Cash Flow (Net Income) Calculation

The rule requires: $\text{Net Income}_{n} = \text{Projected Net Income}_{n} + \text{Net Income}_{n-1} \times \text{ROIC}$.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** I will use the current Trailing 12-Month (LTM) ROIC of **$14.38\%$** as a **conservative but reasonable positive ROIC** to project additional income from retained earnings.
*   **Initial Cash:** The initial Net Income used for the 2026 ROIC calculation will be the 2025 Projected Net Income of $\$237.6 \text{ million}$. The assumption is that Net Income goes straight into cash and is reinvested at the ROIC rate.

| Year | Base Net Income (Millions USD) | ROIC Add-back (Millions USD) | Final Cash Flow (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $237.6$ | $0.0$ | **$237.6$** |
| **2026** | $250.7$ | $237.6 \times 14.38\% = 34.2$ | **$284.9$** |
| **2027** | $264.5$ | $284.9 \times 14.38\% = 41.0$ | **$305.5$** |
| **2028** | $276.7$ | $305.5 \times 14.38\% = 44.0$ | **$320.7$** |
| **2029** | $289.9$ | $320.7 \times 14.38\% = 46.1$ | **$336.0$** |
| **2030** | $298.7$ | $336.0 \times 14.38\% = 48.3$ | **$347.0$** |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### Conservative Discount Rate and Terminal Rate

*   **Discount Rate:** A conservative but reasonable rate of **$9.0\%$** is used, reflecting the company's high leverage and the cyclical nature of the theme park business, while acknowledging its consistent positive cash flow and market position.
*   **Terminal Maturity Rate:** A very conservative, long-term nominal growth rate of **$2.0\%$** is used, reflecting growth slightly below the long-term historical inflation rate.

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (n) | Cash Flow (CFn) (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1+9.0%)^n) | Present Value (PV) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (n=1)** | $237.6$ | $0.9174$ | $218.0$ |
| **2026 (n=2)** | $284.9$ | $0.8417$ | $239.8$ |
| **2027 (n=3)** | $305.5$ | $0.7722$ | $236.0$ |
| **2028 (n=4)** | $320.7$ | $0.7084$ | $227.2$ |
| **2029 (n=5)** | $336.0$ | $0.6499$ | $218.4$ |
| **2030 (n=6)** | $347.0$ | $0.5963$ | $206.9$ |

**Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
*   $TV_{2030} = \text{CF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate}) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$
*   $TV_{2030} = \$347.0 \times (1.02) / (0.09 - 0.02) = \$353.94 / 0.07 = \$5,056.3$ million

**Terminal Value Present Value:**
*   $TV_{PV} = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{n=6}$
*   $TV_{PV} = \$5,056.3 \text{ million} \times 0.5963 = \$3,013.9$ million

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Equity:**
*   $NPV = (\sum \text{PV of Annual CFs}) + TV_{PV}$
*   $NPV = (\$218.0 + \$239.8 + \$236.0 + \$227.2 + \$218.4 + \$206.9) + \$3,013.9$
*   **NPV (Total Equity Value) = $\$4,360.2$ million**

### V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The fair value of the stock is calculated by adjusting the Total Equity Value (NPV) for Total Debt and Cash, and then dividing by the shares outstanding.

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = (\text{NPV of Equity} - \text{Total Debt} + \text{Total Cash}) / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV (Total Equity Value) | $4,360.2$ |
| **Minus:** Total Debt | $2,360.0$ |
| **Plus:** Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $193.9$ |
| **Calculated Equity Value** | $2,194.1$ |
| **Shares Outstanding** (Millions) | $55.02$ |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$39.88** |

| Comparison | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$39.88** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$51.87** |
| **Discount to Market** | $23.1\%$ |

#### Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Price

The calculated fair value of **$39.88** is approximately **$11.99** or **$23.1\%$ lower** than the current market price of **$51.87$**. This difference suggests that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future performance than the conservative projections used in this model.

**The Market's Assumptions are likely based on one or more of the following:**

1.  **More Aggressive Long-Term Growth (The Business Engine):**
    *   **Attendance & Per Capita:** My model assumes a very conservative combined organic growth of $2.5\%$ annually (1.0% attendance + 1.5% per capita). The market is likely pricing in a higher, sustained growth rate, perhaps closer to **$3.0\%$ - $4.0\%$** annually, believing the new attractions and ongoing brand loyalty will reverse the recent weakness in per capita spending (Q2 2025: -2.2%).
2.  **Higher Margin Expansion:**
    *   My model projects Net Income Margin peaking at $15.0\%$ by 2030. The market may anticipate faster and higher margin expansion, driven by permanent cost structure changes or the success of high-margin in-park spending, projecting margins closer to **$16\% - 17\%$**.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate (Lower Risk):**
    *   The market may perceive the company's business model as less risky than my $9.0\%$ discount rate implies. Given the high visibility from annual pass sales (deferred revenue) and the company's strong brand portfolio, the market may be using a lower cost of equity/capital (e.g., **$7.5\%$ to $8.0\%$**), which significantly inflates the NPV.
4.  **Value-Creating Capital Allocation:**
    *   The market is likely placing a premium on the company's aggressive share repurchase program (9.4 million shares repurchased in FY 2024, $\sim 15\%$ of shares outstanding). The announced confidence in future capital allocation, including a new $\$500$ million share repurchase authorization, suggests future earnings per share will be boosted by a shrinking share count, which the market discounts favorably.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated **Fair Value of $\$39.88$** is a robust, *conservative* intrinsic value based on a highly-leveraged balance sheet and a conservative business engine. To justify the market price, the investor would need to believe that PRKS can generate sustainable Net Income margins above $16\%$ *or* maintain an organic revenue growth rate above $3.5\%$ per year, while also executing a successful, multi-year share buyback program.
