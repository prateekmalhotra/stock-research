## II. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections

The business engine for PRKS is driven by **Attendance** multiplied by **Total Revenue Per Capita** (Admissions Per Capita + In-Park Per Capita Spending) [cite: 7 in step 2].

**Recent Trends (FY 2025 YTD):**
*   **Attendance:** Down 1.5% through 9M 2025, primarily due to unfavorable calendar shifts and decreased international visitation [cite: 7 in step 2].
*   **Per Capita Spend:** Total revenue per capita is down 2.4% (9M 2025) [cite: 7 in step 2]. This is due to a 4.9% decline in Admissions Per Capita (likely from aggressive pass/discounting programs) which was only partially offset by a 0.6% increase in In-Park Per Capita Spending [cite: 7 in step 2].

**Management Commentary & Future Assumptions (The Engine):**
Management is executing on a strategy to:
1.  **Rebuild Pass Base/Attendance:** A new "best-ever pass benefits program" was launched, and management expects "improvement and growth" in the pass base [cite: 6 in step 3]. The long-term upside remains as attendance is "still below" historical highs [cite: 14 in step 1].
2.  **Increase High-Margin Revenue:** Forward-booking revenue for the premium *Discovery Cove* and group business into 2026 is "up over 20%" [cite: 6 in step 3]. This suggests a successful shift towards high-value offerings and pricing power in ancillary products.

**Conservative Revenue Growth Projections:**
We will assume the high forward-bookings drive a significant rebound in 2026, but the lingering attendance/pricing pressure (competition from rivals like Epic Universe is a market headwind [cite: 8 in step 3]) forces a conservative long-term growth profile.

| Year | FY Revenue Proj. (Millions USD) | Revenue Growth Rate | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Base) | **\$1,673.0** | -1.19% | 9M 2025 Actuals + Q4 2024 Actuals, slightly down from FY 2024 revenue. |
| **2026** | **\$1,773.4** | **6.0%** | Assumes strong recovery due to new "best-ever" pass program and over +20% forward bookings in high-value segments like Discovery Cove, overcoming 2025 headwinds [cite: 6 in step 3]. |
| **2027** | **\$1,844.3** | **4.0%** | Mid-term growth driven by new ride investments and stable per capita spend increases, still capitalizing on capacity below 2019/2008 levels [cite: 14 in step 1]. |
| **2028** | **\$1,918.1** | **4.0%** | Sustained mid-term growth. |
| **2029** | **\$1,980.2** | **3.25%** | Conservative slowdown as new attractions normalize and competition (e.g., Epic Universe) impacts the Florida market. |
| **2030** | **\$2,039.6** | **3.0%** | Maturing growth rate. |

## III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

The "cash flow" in this DCF is proxied by Net Income, as per the rules.

**Margin and ROIC Assumptions:**
*   **Net Income Margin:** Q3 2025 performance showed a drop in Net Income [cite: 7 in step 2]. Management is addressing cost execution issues [cite: 6 in step 3]. We will use a conservative starting point and project a slow improvement towards a sustainable margin.
    *   **2025 (Base):** Conservative **10.0%** (Below 9M 2025's 11.89%).
    *   **2026 - 2030:** A gradual, conservative increase from **10.5%** to **12.0%** by 2030, reflecting operational efficiency gains management is focused on [cite: 6 in step 3] and better margin from premium product mix.
*   **ROIC:** The company's LTM ROIC is stated as a "good 12.9%" [cite: 5 in step 3]. We will use a conservative **8.0%** to generate additional income from retained net income (cash).

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | NI from Ops (B) | NI from ROIC on Prior Year Cash (C) | Total Net Income / Cash Flow (B+C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Base) | \$1,673.0 | 10.0% | \$167.3 | \$0.0 | **\$167.3** |
| **2026** | \$1,773.4 | 10.5% | \$186.2 | \$13.4 (167.3 * 8.0%) | **\$199.6** |
| **2027** | \$1,844.3 | 11.0% | \$202.9 | \$16.0 (199.6 * 8.0%) | **\$218.9** |
| **2028** | \$1,918.1 | 11.5% | \$220.6 | \$17.5 (218.9 * 8.0%) | **\$238.1** |
| **2029** | \$1,980.2 | 11.75% | \$232.7 | \$19.0 (238.1 * 8.0%) | **\$251.7** |
| **2030** | \$2,039.6 | 12.0% | \$244.7 | \$20.1 (251.7 * 8.0%) | **\$264.8** |

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### 1. Terminal Value

*   **2030 Cash Flow (CF):** \$264.8 million
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **2.0%**
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** **10.0%** (Slightly higher than a typical WACC to account for high leverage and discretionary consumer spending risk [cite: 5 in step 3]).

**Terminal Value (TV) Formula:**
TV = CF * (1 + g) / (r - g)
TV = \$264.8 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02)
TV = \$270.1 / 0.08
TV = **\$3,376.3 million**

### 2. Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year | Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1.10)^n) | Present Value (PV) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (n=0) | \$167.3 | 1.000 | \$167.3 |
| **2026** (n=1) | \$199.6 | 0.909 | \$181.4 |
| **2027** (n=2) | \$218.9 | 0.826 | \$180.8 |
| **2028** (n=3) | \$238.1 | 0.751 | \$178.8 |
| **2029** (n=4) | \$251.7 | 0.683 | \$171.9 |
| **2030** (n=5) | \$264.8 | 0.621 | \$164.4 |
| **2030 Terminal Value** | \$3,376.3 | 0.621 | \$2,096.3 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$3,140.9 million** |

---

## V. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value Formula:**
Fair Value = (Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Cash) - Total Debt

**Total Enterprise Value:**
Total NPV = \$3,140.9 million
Total Cash = \$183.23 million
Total Debt = \$2,251.88 million

Equity Value = (\$3,140.9 + \$183.23) - \$2,251.88
Equity Value = \$3,324.13 - \$2,251.88
**Equity Value = \$1,072.25 million**

**Fair Value Per Share:**
Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$1,072.25 million / 55.03 million shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$19.48**

## VI. Conclusion and Justification

### Summary of Valuation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$37.65** |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **\$19.48** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 55.03 Million |
| **Total Equity Value (DCF)** | \$1,072.25 Million |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$19.48** per share is significantly lower than the Current Stock Price of **\$37.65**.

The market is making a vastly different assumption about the company's future performance, specifically on two key drivers: **Long-Term Growth** and **Cost/Margin Control**.

| Assumption | Valuation Model Assumption (Conservative) | Market Assumption (Implied) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-Term Growth (g)** | **2.0%** Perpetual Growth | **~4.7%** Perpetual Growth (to justify \$37.65 at a 10.0% discount rate) |
| **Average Net Income Margin** | Steady increase to a conservative **12.0%** by 2030 | Steady state closer to the historical high, perhaps **18-20%**, or much faster growth, reflecting an aggressive cost control or a successful premiumization of the entire portfolio. |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | Conservative **10.0%** (High-Risk) | Lower, possibly **8.0%** (Lower Risk Perception) |

**Conclusion:**
Our conservative valuation dictates that the stock is **overvalued** by the market. The discrepancy of over 90% is likely due to the market pricing in a very successful execution of management's turnaround strategy.

1.  **Market is aggressive on Recovery & Growth:** The market appears to believe that the strong forward-booking for Discovery Cove and new pass benefits will translate into a high single-digit revenue growth rate (6-8%) for the next 5-10 years, not the 3.0%-6.0% range used here. The market is likely anticipating PRKS to return to and surpass the 2019 attendance levels faster and more aggressively, capitalizing on its stated under-capacity [cite: 14 in step 1].
2.  **Market is aggressive on Margin Improvement:** Given the company's recent decline in Net Income Margin (down 25.4% YoY in Q3 2025) [cite: 7 in step 2] and high recent LTM Operating Margin of 24.4% [cite: 5 in step 3], the market believes management's plans to "address cost execution issues" will be extremely successful, restoring and exceeding the 2022-2023 high profitability levels.

The market is betting on a rapid and near-perfect execution of the operational and strategic shifts. Our conservative model, which assumes moderate but consistent growth and a slower, modest margin recovery, views the stock at a substantially lower value.
