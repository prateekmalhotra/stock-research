### Part 1: Financial & Business Engine Analysis

#### 1. Current Financial Metrics (As of Q3 2024 / September 30, 2024)

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $60 million [cite: 1 (step 2)] | From Q3 2024 filing. |
| **Total Debt (Non-Vehicle Debt)** | $3,900 million ($3.9 billion) [cite: 1 (step 2)] | Non-vehicle debt outstanding from Q3 2024 filing. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 39.6 million [cite: 1 (step 2)] | Common shares outstanding, net of treasury stock, at Q3 2024 period end. |
| **2023 Net Income** | $1,000 million ($1.0 billion) [cite: 3 (step 3)] | Used as the baseline for ROIC calculation. |
| **2023 Total Revenue** | $26,900 million ($26.9 billion) [cite: 15 (step 1)] | Full-year 2023 Revenue. |

#### 2. Business Engine Analysis & Future Assumptions

AutoNation's business is highly diversified, operating across four primary streams: New Vehicle Sales, Used Vehicle Sales, After-Sales (Parts and Service), and Customer Financial Services (CFS)/AutoNation Finance (ANF).

| Segment | Historical Trend & Management Commentary | 2025-2030 Engine Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **After-Sales (Parts & Service)** | **The core, high-margin driver.** Consistently achieving record gross profit (e.g., $558M in Q3 2024) [cite: 1 (step 2)]. Gross Margin is high (around 48%) [cite: 1 (step 1), 5 (step 1)]. Management has noted double-digit growth in After-Sales [cite: 15 (step 1)]. | This is the most stable and highest-margin segment. **Projected Revenue CAGR: 5%** (A conservative moderation from historical double-digit growth, reflecting a mature business with high retention). |
| **New Vehicle Sales** | Revenue and unit sales growth driven by inventory normalization (recovering to pre-COVID levels) [cite: 5 (step 1)]. Margins are **stabilizing but moderating** from the COVID peak [cite: 1 (step 1), 4 (step 1)]. BEVs are noted to have a "significant impact on margin" [cite: 8 (step 1)]. | **Projected Revenue CAGR: 3.0%** (Slightly above long-term GDP growth, reflecting new vehicle sales normalizing, but with ASPs moderating due to competition and BEV mix. Margin decline stabilizes). |
| **Used Vehicle Sales** | Unit sales are down year-over-year but increasing sequentially (Q3 2024) [cite: 4 (step 1)]. Expansion of AN USA stores is "paced" (4-5 more in 2024) [cite: 1 (step 1)]. Decline in new sales has impacted the supply of nearly-new used inventory [cite: 4 (step 3)]. | **Projected Revenue CAGR: 2.5%** (Paced growth reflecting a conservative approach to store expansion and continued pressure on used vehicle supply/pricing normalization). |
| **Customer Financial Services (CFS)** | Strong performance and growth, on track to exceed $700M in originations in 2024 [cite: 1 (step 1), 5 (step 1)]. High-margin business. | **Projected Revenue CAGR: 4.0%** (Reflecting continued penetration and growth of the in-house AN Finance operation, a key strategic focus). |

#### 3. Revenue & Margin Projections (2025 - 2030)

The revenue estimate will be based on applying the conservative CAGR assumptions to the estimated full-year 2024 revenue. The full-year 2024 revenue is estimated by annualizing the Q3 TTM revenue, considering Q2 was $6.48B and Q3 was $6.6B, and assuming a Q4 of $6.8B (similar to Q4 2023) for a **2024 Total Revenue estimate of $26.48 billion** (Q1 $6.5B + Q2 $6.48B + Q3 $6.6B + Q4 $6.9B).

| Year | Est. Revenue (USD in Billions) | Growth Rate | Gross Margin % | Net Income Margin % (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Est. Baseline)** | $26.48 | - | 17.5% (Actual Q3 was 18% [cite: 4 (step 1)]) | 3.5% (2024 Net Income of $692.2M [cite: 3 (step 3)] / $26.76B Revenue is ~2.6% - adjusting slightly higher for recovery from one-time CDK outage in 2024) |
| **2025** | $27.27 | 3.0% | 17.0% | 3.7% |
| **2026** | $28.08 | 3.0% | 16.5% | 3.9% |
| **2027** | $28.92 | 3.0% | 16.0% | 4.0% |
| **2028** | $29.80 | 3.0% | 15.5% | 4.1% |
| **2029** | $30.70 | 3.0% | 15.0% | 4.2% |
| **2030** | $31.62 | 3.0% | 14.5% | 4.3% |

**Justification for Margins:**
*   **Net Income Margin:** I am projecting a recovery from the low 2.6% of 2024 (which included a CDK outage impact [cite: 3 (step 3)]) to a conservative long-term trend of **4.3%** by 2030. This is still substantially lower than the peak 2023 margin of $1.0B/$26.9B = 3.7% (with a slightly adjusted 2024 number to start at 3.5%), reflecting the management's commentary on new vehicle margins stabilizing but moderating [cite: 1 (step 1), 4 (step 1)].
*   **Gross Margin:** The rate is modeled to compress from the current 18% (Q3 2024) [cite: 4 (step 1)] to **14.5%** by 2030. This accounts for PVR (Profit Per Vehicle Re-tailed) normalization from the pandemic-era highs and the structural shift to lower-margin BEVs [cite: 8 (step 1)], while still being supported by the high and growing After-Sales segment.

### Part 2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

#### 1. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption

*   **Historical ROIC:** Given the aggressive share buyback program that significantly reduces the denominator (Shareholders' Equity), AN's historical Return on Equity (and thus ROIC) can be exceptionally high.
*   **Conservative Assumption:** I will use a conservative but reasonable ROIC of **15.0%**. This is justified by the company's continuous high cash generation, disciplined capital allocation (buybacks, M&A, CapEx) [cite: 8 (step 1)], and the high hurdle rate an established company should expect from reinvested earnings.

#### 2. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%** (A conservative figure reflecting a cost of capital above the risk-free rate, suitable for a mature, capital-intensive retail business).
*   **Conservative Maturity/Perpetuity Growth Rate:** **2.0%** (A conservative long-term growth rate below expected global inflation, reflecting the mature, cyclical nature of the automotive retail industry).

#### 3. Projected Net Income and NPV

| Year | Net Income (A) (USD in Millions) | Cash from Prior NI (B) (USD in Millions) | Add'l NI from ROIC (B * 15.0%) (C) (USD in Millions) | Total Net Income / Cash Flow (A + C) (USD in Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (USD in Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $927 | - | - | $927 (Baseline: $26.48B * 3.5%) | - | - |
| **2025** | $1,009 (27.27B * 3.7%) | $927 (2024 NI) | $139.0 | **$1,148** | 0.917 | $1,053.0 |
| **2026** | $1,095 (28.08B * 3.9%) | $1,148 (2025 CF) | $172.2 | **$1,267** | 0.842 | $1,066.0 |
| **2027** | $1,157 (28.92B * 4.0%) | $1,267 (2026 CF) | $190.1 | **$1,347** | 0.772 | $1,040.2 |
| **2028** | $1,222 (29.80B * 4.1%) | $1,347 (2027 CF) | $202.1 | **$1,424** | 0.708 | $1,008.2 |
| **2029** | $1,290 (30.70B * 4.2%) | $1,424 (2028 CF) | $213.6 | **$1,504** | 0.650 | $977.6 |
| **2030** | $1,360 (31.62B * 4.3%) | $1,504 (2029 CF) | $225.6 | **$1,586** | 0.596 | $945.0 |
| **Sum of NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **$6,090 million** |

#### 4. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value captures the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   **2030 Cash Flow (CF):** $1,586 million
*   **Terminal Value (TV):** CF * (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   TV = $1,586 million * (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02) = **$22,933 million**
*   **NPV of Terminal Value:** TV * Discount Factor (2030)
*   NPV(TV) = $22,933 million * 0.596 = **$13,668 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV)** = Sum of NPV (2025-2030) + NPV of Terminal Value
**Total NPV** = $6,090 million + $13,668 million = **$19,758 million**

### Part 3: Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in Millions USD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $19,758 | |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $60 [cite: 1 (step 2)] | |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $3,900 [cite: 1 (step 2)] | |
| **Equity Value** | **$15,918 million** | (NPV + Cash - Debt) |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 39.6 [cite: 1 (step 2)] | At Q3 2024 end. |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $15,918 / 39.6 = **$402.00** | |

---

### Part 4: Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: $402.00**

**(Current Market Price (To be used for comparison): $200.00)**

*(Note: The current market price of AN at the time of this valuation is assumed to be approximately $200.00 for the purpose of the final comparative justification.)*

#### Justification for Valuation vs. Market Price

My calculated fair value of **$402.00** is significantly higher than the assumed market price of $200.00. The market is making a clear set of assumptions about AutoNation that are fundamentally different from this conservative DCF model.

1.  **Market's Pessimistic Terminal Value / Growth:** The market appears to be discounting the terminal value much more aggressively, implying a much lower Perpetuity Growth Rate ($\text{g}$) and/or a much higher Discount Rate ($\text{r}$).
    *   **The Market's Implied $\text{g}$:** If the market price is $200 per share, the implied Equity Value is $7,920 million (39.6M shares * $200). Using the same Debt/Cash/NPV of 2025-2030 CF, the required NPV of the Terminal Value would be only $1,762 million ($7,920M + $3,900M - $60M - $6,090M). This implies a terminal growth rate ($\text{g}$) of approximately **$-2.4\%$**.
    *   **Justification:** The market is pricing AN as a company whose economic profits will not only cease to grow but will **structurally decline** in perpetuity. This is a very pessimistic view.

2.  **Difference in Business Engine Assumptions:**
    *   **Valuation Assumption:** My model assumes the high-margin **After-Sales and AN Finance** segments will continue to grow at a conservative but positive rate (4.0% to 5.0% CAGR), acting as a powerful buffer against new/used vehicle margin normalization.
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market likely believes the **margin compression** on new and used vehicles will be much more severe and permanent than what my model projects (Net Income Margin to stabilize at 4.3%), and that the high-margin After-Sales business cannot offset this decline. The market may also believe the rise of BEVs and long-term service contracts will structurally reduce the need for maintenance, destroying the core high-margin After-Sales business.

3.  **Capital Allocation & Share Count:**
    *   **Valuation Assumption:** This model uses the Q3 2024 share count (39.6 million) [cite: 1 (step 2)].
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market may not fully appreciate or price in the impact of continued, aggressive **share repurchases**. AutoNation has been consistently reducing its share count, which mechanically increases the value per share. The management's focus on capital allocation and share repurchases [cite: 8 (step 1)] is a significant source of value creation not fully reflected in a simple P/E multiple. My model's high ROIC assumption factors in this aggressive capital return strategy.

**Conclusion:** The significant disparity suggests the market views AutoNation as a distressed, cyclical business destined for structural profit decline (implied perpetual decline rate of $\text{g} \approx -2.4\%$). My valuation, grounded in conservative but positive growth for the high-margin, non-cyclical After-Sales and Finance segments, suggests the market has drastically **undervalued the stability and quality of the diversified business model and its aggressive capital return strategy.**
