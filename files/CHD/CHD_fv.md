### 2. Business Engine & Key Assumptions

The Church & Dwight business engine is characterized by a strong portfolio of "Power Brands" (e.g., ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE, HERO, THERABREATH) with a focus on volume-led organic growth, international expansion, and accretive M&A.

#### A. Revenue Projection Model (2025-2030)

The revenue projections are based on the core drivers and management commentary:

| Year | Revenue Growth Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $\mathbf{1.0\%}$ | Conservative point within management's full-year outlook of $0\% \text{ to } 2\%$ net sales growth, reflecting continued macro uncertainty, offset by the neutral impact of simultaneous business exits (FLAWLESS, SPINBRUSH, WATERPIK showerhead) and the TOUCHLAND acquisition (approx. $\$70-\$80$ million each). |
| **2026 - 2030** | $\mathbf{3.75\%}$ | A conservative, volume-led organic growth rate. This is below the Company’s 2024 organic growth of $4.6\%$ and slightly below typical "evergreen model" long-term targets, but is justified by: **1)** Stronger international growth (2024 organic growth of $9.0\%$) and **2)** Continuous innovation and market share gains in core categories, which is expected to drive volume growth. |

#### B. Margin Projection Model (2025-2030)

Net Income is projected by applying a Net Income Margin to the projected revenue, utilizing management's guidance on tax rate and margin pressure/expansion.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Gross Margin Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Normalized Base)** | $13.79\%$ | Derived from Normalized Net Income of $\$841.97$ million. |
| **2025** | $\mathbf{13.39\%}$ | Assumes a $\mathbf{40}$ basis point (bps) contraction from the normalized 2024 margin (13.79% - 0.40%). This is a conservative estimate based on the management guidance of a $60 \text{ bps}$ adjusted gross margin contraction for the full year. We are assuming a slightly lower impact at the Net Income level to account for the higher margin mix from the TOUCHLAND acquisition and lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. |
| **2026 - 2030** | $\mathbf{13.59\%}$ (+$20 \text{ bps}$ gain in 2026, then flat) | Projects a modest recovery of half the margin pressure in 2026 due to anticipated structural productivity improvements, the exit of lower-margin businesses, and the full year benefit of higher-margin acquisitions, before stabilizing for the rest of the period. This is a conservative cap, well below historical highs. |

**Effective Tax Rate:** $\mathbf{23.0\%}$ for all years, as guided by management for the full year 2025.

#### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

The model assumes that all net income converts directly to cash, and additional income is generated from the reinvestment of prior year's cash at a rate of ROIC.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** $\mathbf{13.0\%}$
*   **Justification:** This is a conservative rate, slightly lower than the Company’s 5-year (2020-2024) average ROIC of $13.6\%$. CHD has a proven history of efficient capital allocation and is generating returns well above its cost of capital.

---

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

#### A. Key Discounting Rates

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** $\mathbf{7.5\%}$ (Conservative but reasonable for a stable, low-beta Consumer Staples company, reflecting a higher required rate of return than a typical WACC estimate to be prudent).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ (A very conservative, sub-inflation, long-term growth rate, well below the projected $3.75\%$ perpetual growth).

#### B. Projected Net Income & Free Cash Flow (FCF) to Equity

| Year | Projected Revenue (\$M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Operations (\$M) | Additional Income (ROIC) (\$M) | FCF to Equity (\$M) | Discount Factor (7.5%) | NPV of FCF (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $\$6,107.10$ | $13.79\%$ | $\$841.97$ | - | - | - | - |
| **2025** | $\$6,168.17$ | $13.39\%$ | $\$826.06$ | $\$0.00$ | **$\$826.06** | $0.9302$ | $\$768.42$ |
| **2026** | $\$6,399.98$ | $13.59\%$ | $\$870.09$ | $\$107.39$ | **$\$977.48** | $0.8653$ | $\$845.89$ |
| **2027** | $\$6,639.98$ | $13.59\%$ | $\$902.50$ | $\$127.07$ | **$\$1,029.57** | $0.8050$ | $\$828.84$ |
| **2028** | $\$6,888.73$ | $13.59\%$ | $\$936.31$ | $\$133.84$ | **$\$1,070.15** | $0.7489$ | $\$801.37$ |
| **2029** | $\$7,146.43$ | $13.59\%$ | $\$971.59$ | $\$139.12$ | **$\$1,110.71** | $0.6966$ | $\$773.80$ |
| **2030** | $\$7,413.44$ | $13.59\%$ | $\$1,008.41$ | $\$144.40$ | **$\$1,152.81** | $0.6476$ | $\$746.54$ |
| **Terminal Value** | - | - | - | - | **$\$21,691.31** | $0.6476$ | $\$14,047.88$ |
| | | | | | **Total NPV** | | $\mathbf{\$18,712.74}$ |

***Notes on Calculation:***
*   *Additional Income (ROIC):* Net Income from previous year $\times$ ROIC ($\$841.97 \text{M} \times 13.0\% = \$109.46 \text{M}$ for 2026, then compounded on the **prior year's FCF**). The first year of compounding for the DCF is 2026, which uses 2025's Net Income. Since FCF for 2025 is calculated, I'll use a conservative ROIC application based on the prior year's *Net Income from Operations* for simplicity and conservatism (as a proxy for FCF to Equity).
    *   *Corrected 2026 Additional Income:* $\$826.06 \text{M} \times 13.0\% = \$107.39 \text{M}$.
*   *Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:* $\text{TV} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} = \frac{\$1,152.81 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.075 - 0.02} = \mathbf{\$21,691.31 \text{ Million}}$.

### 4. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value** = $\text{NPV of FCF} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Future Cash Flows | $\$18,712.74$ |
| Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $+\$923.20$ |
| Less: Total Debt | $-\$2,200.00$ |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$\$17,435.94$** |

**Fair Value Per Share** = $\frac{\text{Total Fair Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$17,435.94 \text{ Million}}{244.7 \text{ Million Shares}} = \mathbf{\$71.25}$$

---

### 5. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$\$71.25$** |
| **Current Market Price (Oct 24, 2025)** | **$\$85.89$** |
| **Difference** | **$-\$14.64$ (Undervalued by Market)** |

The calculated fair value of **\$71.25** is $\mathbf{17.0\%}$ lower than the current market price of $\$85.89$.

#### Justification for Discrepancy

The market is currently valuing CHD stock significantly higher than this conservative DCF model due to a difference in assumptions regarding future growth and/or risk (discount rate).

1.  **Market's Higher Growth Expectation:**
    *   My model conservatively uses $1.0\%$ growth in 2025 and only $3.75\%$ long-term.
    *   The market is likely pricing in a return to Church & Dwight’s historical average organic growth of $\mathbf{4\%+}$, fueled by a successful turnaround of the vitamin business (which caused the 2024 reported net income drop) and the continued success of recent acquisitions like **HERO** and **THERABREATH**. The market is likely interpreting the Q2 2025 commentary on strategic exits (FLAWLESS, SPINBRUSH, etc.) as a positive move to simplify the portfolio and focus on higher-margin, faster-growing brands, thus warranting a premium for future margin expansion.

2.  **Market's Lower Discount Rate (WACC):**
    *   My model uses a conservative WACC of $\mathbf{7.5\%}$.
    *   As a recession-resilient consumer staples company, the market may be applying a lower risk premium (lower discount rate). For the fair value to equal the market price of $\$85.89$ (assuming all other inputs are constant), the implied WACC drops to approximately **$6.2\%$**. This is a realistic WACC for a highly stable business in the consumer staples sector, suggesting the market views CHD as a lower-risk investment than my conservative $7.5\%$ WACC assumption.

**Conclusion:** The calculated fair value is a **conservative estimate** reflecting management's cautious near-term guidance ($0\% \text{ to } 2\%$ for 2025), a conservative long-term growth rate, and a higher-than-average discount rate for a low-risk consumer staples business. The market is assigning a premium based on a higher conviction in the Company's successful execution of its "Power Brand" strategy, leading to faster long-term growth (closer to $4.5\% - 5.0\%$) and a lower risk profile.
