## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Revenue Engine and Projections (2025 - 2030)

CHD's business engine is driven by its "Power Brands" (representing ~85% of revenue), which are category leaders like ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE, and recent high-growth acquisitions like HERO and THERABREATH. Management's long-term "evergreen model" targets strong organic sales growth, recently revised higher.

**Assumptions & Justification:**

1.  **FY 2025 Base Year:** Management guides for $\approx 0\%$ to $2\%$ reported and organic sales growth for the full year 2025. This reflects a challenging macro environment, retailer inventory reductions, and the near-equalizing impact of the *Touchland* acquisition ($70M-$80M in) and exited businesses ($78M out). **I will use the midpoint of the conservative range: 1.0% reported growth for FY2025.**
2.  **FY 2026 - FY 2030:** Once the challenging inventory and macro issues are lapped (post-2025), I will assume a return to the long-term growth trajectory driven by:
    *   **Volume & Innovation:** Management commentary highlights volume as the primary driver of organic growth expected to continue in 2025. High-growth power brands like HERO and THERABREATH are driving consumption growth and have significant room for household penetration.
    *   **Conservatism:** While the long-term model calls for **4%** organic sales growth (cited in transcripts from 2024), to be conservative and factor in a competitive consumer staples environment and divestiture risks (e.g., vitamins), I will assume the reported net sales growth tapers up to **3.5%** and holds.

| Year | 2024 (Base) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (USD Millions)** | $6,107.1 | **$6,168.2** | **$6,322.4** | **$6,543.7** | **$6,772.8** | **$7,009.9** | **$7,255.2** |
| **Growth Rate** | - | 1.0% | 2.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% | 3.5% |
| *Rationale:* | *Actual* | *Midpoint of conservative 0-2% guidance* | *Conservative ramp-up* | *Below 4% long-term target* | *Below 4% long-term target* | *Below 4% long-term target* | *Below 4% long-term target* |

### B. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025 - 2030)

Management has an "evergreen model" for margin expansion, but 2025 is guided for contraction.

**Assumptions & Justification:**

1.  **Net Income Margin Base:** I calculate the 2024 Net Income Margin as $847.6 / $6,107.1 \approx 13.88\%$.
2.  **FY 2025 Net Income Margin:** Management guides for a 60 bps (0.6%) contraction in Adjusted Gross Margin for 2025. Given this pressure, I will conservatively project a **50 bps contraction in the Net Income Margin** for 2025 to **13.38%** to reflect the margin pressure and lower volume-driven growth.
3.  **FY 2026 - FY 2030 Net Income Margin:** The long-term model targets 25 to 50 bps of gross margin expansion. I will conservatively assume a **10 bps expansion in the Net Income Margin per year** starting in 2026, which is below the Gross Margin guidance and reflects steady operational improvement and leverage.

| Metric | 2024 (Base) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (A)** | $6,107.1 | $6,168.2 | $6,322.4 | $6,543.7 | $6,772.8 | $7,009.9 | $7,255.2 |
| **NI Margin %** | 13.88% | 13.38% | 13.48% | 13.58% | 13.68% | 13.78% | 13.88% |
| **Net Income (Initial)** | $847.6 | $825.8 | $852.4 | $889.7 | $926.5 | $966.0 | $1,007.4 |

### C. Cash Flow and ROIC Calculation (2025 - 2030)

The rule states: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from Net Income got from previous year (assumed to go straight into cash)*. This model treats Net Income as Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) and reinvests it at the ROIC rate.

**Assumptions:**

*   **ROIC Rate:** We will use the historical 5-year average of **13.6%**.
*   **Initial Cash Base:** The valuation starts *after* the base year (2024). The cash for reinvestment will be the **Prior Year's Adjusted Net Income**.

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial Net Income (NI_Initial)** | $825.8 | $852.4 | $889.7 | $926.5 | $966.0 | $1,007.4 |
| **Prior Year NI as Cash (B)** | $847.6 (2024 NI) | $825.8 | $852.4 | $889.7 | $926.5 | $966.0 |
| **Additional Income (B * 13.6%)** | $115.3 | $112.3 | $115.9 | $121.0 | $126.0 | $131.4 |
| **Total FCFE (NI_Initial + Additional Income)** | **$941.1** | **$964.7** | **$1,005.6** | **$1,047.5** | **$1,092.0** | **$1,138.8** |

### D. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Terminal Value

**Assumptions & Justification:**

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** For a conservative, stable consumer staples company, I will use a conservative but reasonable discount rate of **7.5%**. This is higher than a typical risk-free rate and reflects a modest equity risk premium.
2.  **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** Given the stable, low-growth nature of the consumer staples industry and a long-term target organic growth of 4%, a very conservative terminal growth rate is **2.0%**. This is below historical inflation and the company's long-term growth aspirations.

**1. Calculate Terminal Value (TV) in 2030**

The terminal value uses the 2030 FCFE (cash flow from the projected income, not the initial NI):

*   FCFE_2030 = $1,138.8 million
*   Terminal Value (TV) = FCFE_2030 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
*   TV = $1,138.8 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.075 - 0.02)
*   TV = $1,138.8 * 1.02 / 0.055
*   **TV = $21,114.7 million**

**2. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV)**

| Year | FCFE (USD Millions) | Discount Factor @ 7.5% | NPV of FCFE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | $941.1 | 0.9302 | $875.4 |
| 2026 | $964.7 | 0.8653 | $834.6 |
| 2027 | $1,005.6 | 0.8049 | $809.5 |
| 2028 | $1,047.5 | 0.7487 | $784.4 |
| 2029 | $1,092.0 | 0.6965 | $760.3 |
| 2030 | $1,138.8 + $21,114.7 (TV) = $22,253.5 | 0.6479 | $14,411.3 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$18,475.5** |

### E. Final Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $18,475.5 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $923.2 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $2,200.0 |
| **Calculated Equity Value** | **$17,198.7** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | 246.4 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$69.88** |

## Final Justification and Conclusion

### Calculated Fair Value Per Share: **$69.88**

### Current Market Value Per Share (as of October 24, 2025): **$86.89**

### Market Assumptions Justification

My calculated fair value of **$69.88** is significantly lower (approximately 19.6% lower) than the current market price of **$86.89**. This disparity suggests that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about Church & Dwight's future performance than my conservative DCF model.

**Reasons for the Disparity (Market vs. Model):**

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Long-Term Growth Rate (g):** My model uses a very conservative long-term maturity rate of **2.0%**. The market is likely pricing in a return to or acceleration past the company's **4% organic growth evergreen model** due to the success of high-growth acquisitions like HERO and THERABREATH, which still have significant household penetration runway. To justify the current market price, the implied perpetual growth rate ($g$) in my model would need to be approximately **3.2%** (holding WACC at 7.5%).
2.  **Market Assumes Higher Margin Expansion:** My model is conservative, projecting a 50 bps Net Income Margin *contraction* in 2025, and only a slow 10 bps annual *expansion* thereafter, only returning to the 2024 margin by 2030. The market likely believes management's ability to drive greater gross margin expansion (guided up to 50 bps annually in the evergreen model) will translate to faster and more significant net income margin growth, more than offsetting current inflationary pressures.
3.  **Market Assumes Lower Risk/Discount Rate (WACC):** I used a conservative WACC of **7.5%**. Given CHD's defensive nature as a consumer staples company with a low Beta (cited in search results as 0.43) and stable cash flow, the market may be using a lower WACC, perhaps closer to 6.5% or 7.0%. A lower discount rate significantly inflates the NPV of the distant, high-value terminal cash flows.

**Conclusion:**

My conservative valuation, strictly adhering to a very conservative terminal growth rate (2.0%) and a slightly high WACC (7.5%), indicates that the stock may be overvalued. The market is assigning a higher value to CHD's consistently growing portfolio of power brands, their ability to execute on their long-term 4% organic growth and margin expansion "evergreen model," and the strong growth potential of recent acquisitions. For my model to match the market price, I would need to assume a $\approx 3.2\%$ terminal growth rate, which I deem less conservative but more in line with the company's long-term targets and the market's current bullish outlook on its successful M&A strategy.
