### II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Charter is shifting from a mature, traditional cable provider to a converged connectivity and mobile services company.

**Key Components of the Business Engine (Based on Earnings Calls):**
1.  **Mobile (Spectrum Mobile):** This is the primary growth driver. The company added nearly 2.5 million lines in 2023 and 545,000 lines in Q3 2024. Penetration is still low (around 13% of Internet customers), and management expects **"meaningful growth over the next several years"**. Mobile service revenue grew at a robust **37.6% year-over-year** in Q3 2024.
2.  **Broadband (Internet ARPU & Rural Expansion):** Core Internet customer growth is pressured by competition from Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and fiber overbuilders, and the loss of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) subsidies. This is mitigated by:
    *   **ARPU Growth:** Residential Internet ARPU grew 1.7% in Q3 2024 (and 2.7% adjusted in Q2 2024).
    *   **Rural Build (RDOF):** Customer additions and penetration in the subsidized rural footprint are **outperforming expectations** (approaching 50% penetration in 12-month cohorts), which will offset core customer losses until the build is completed (expected by end of 2026).
3.  **Video/Voice:** These segments are in structural decline, with customer losses driven by rate increases and cord-cutting. Programming costs are declining (10% in Q3 2024), which is a tailwind for EBITDA margin.

**Revenue Projections (In Billions USD) - Conservative Assumptions:**

| Year | Annual Revenue (B) | Yo-Y Growth (%) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Est. Baseline)** | **$54.9** | 0.55% | Based on LTM Q3 2024 (Slightly conservative given 2023's growth). |
| **2025** | **$56.0** | 2.0% | **Conservative:** Assumes Mobile growth begins to decelerate (25% Yo-Y) and Core Broadband/Video/Voice stabilize with 0.5% growth (ARPU + Rural vs. Core Customer/Video decline). Management expects ACP impact to be behind them by Q4 2024, stabilizing the core business. |
| **2026** | **$57.2** | 2.2% | **Modest Acceleration:** Continued strong, but decelerating, Mobile growth (20% Yo-Y). Core Broadband/ARPU continues at 1.0% growth. RDOF build completes, adding more stable, high-penetration customers. |
| **2027** | **$58.7** | 2.6% | **Post-RDOF Build:** Capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly post-2026 completion of RDOF. Mobile growth continues to decelerate (15% Yo-Y) but becomes a larger mix of revenue. Core Broadband/ARPU at 1.5%. |
| **2028** | **$60.3** | 2.7% | **Stable Growth:** Mobile growth (12% Yo-Y) continues. Core Broadband/ARPU at 2.0% (in line with historical ARPU) as network upgrades provide a competitive edge. |
| **2029** | **$62.1** | 3.0% | **Minor Acceleration/Stability:** Mobile penetration deepens (10% Yo-Y). Core business stabilizes at a conservative 2.5% ARPU/net growth. |
| **2030** | **$63.9** | 3.0% | **Terminal Growth:** Consistent, low-to-mid single-digit growth driven by price increases, mobile expansion, and a stable, upgraded network. |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection

The high Net Income Margin (8.42% in 2023) is a proxy for future cash flows. Management commentary highlights a margin tailwind from declining programming costs and operational efficiency.

| Year | Revenue (B) | Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income (B) | Net Income for ROIC (B) | ROIC Income (B) | Total Net Income (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Est. Baseline)** | $54.9 | 8.40% | $4.61$ | N/A | N/A | $4.61$ |
| **2025** | $56.0$ | 8.50% | $4.76$ | $4.61$ (From 2024) | $0.14$ | **$4.90** |
| **2026** | $57.2$ | 8.60% | $4.92$ | $4.90$ (From 2025) | $0.15$ | **$5.07** |
| **2027** | $58.7$ | 9.00% | $5.28$ | $5.07$ (From 2026) | $0.15$ | **$5.43** |
| **2028** | $60.3$ | 9.50% | $5.73$ | $5.43$ (From 2027) | $0.16$ | **$5.89** |
| **2029** | $62.1$ | 9.50% | $5.90$ | $5.89$ (From 2028) | $0.18$ | **$6.08** |
| **2030** | $63.9$ | 9.50% | $6.07$ | $6.08$ (From 2029) | $0.18$ | **$6.25** |

**Margin Justification:**
*   The Net Income Margin is conservatively assumed to increase from 8.4% to a stable 9.5% by 2028. This accounts for continued programing cost declines (which boost EBITDA) and a large reduction in depreciation/amortization from the anticipated drop in capital expenditures post-2026 (RDOF completion).
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The last reported ROIC for Charter is volatile and often low due to its massive debt load. Given the conservative positive net income projections, I will use a **conservative positive ROIC of 3.0%** on the previous year's Net Income to calculate additional income. This acts as a conservative reinvestment yield.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Total Net Income is used as the **Cash Flow** for the DCF calculation, as per the rules of the valuation.

**Valuation Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a highly leveraged company (Debt-to-Equity is very high), which increases systematic risk. A 9.0% discount rate is a reasonably conservative rate for a stable, high-debt company in the competitive, but essential, telecom infrastructure industry.
*   **Terminal Maturity Rate (Very Conservative):** **2.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This assumes a stable, long-term growth rate for the business below nominal GDP and historical inflation, reflecting the mature nature of the core cable business and the highly competitive environment, despite mobile growth.

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) (B) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $4.90$ | $0.9174$ | $4.50$ |
| **2026** | $5.07$ | $0.8417$ | $4.27$ |
| **2027** | $5.43$ | $0.7722$ | $4.19$ |
| **2028** | $5.89$ | $0.7084$ | $4.17$ |
| **2029** | $6.08$ | $0.6499$ | $3.95$ |
| **2030** | $6.25$ | $0.5963$ | $3.73$ |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | $6.25 \times \frac{1.02}{0.09 - 0.02} = 91.07$ | $0.5963$ | $54.26$ |
| **Sum of NPV of All Future Cash Flows** | **$79.07$ B** | | |

*Terminal Value Calculation: $CF_{2030} \times (1 + g) / (r - g) = \$6.25 B \times 1.02 / (0.09 - 0.02) = \$91.07$ B*

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in Billions USD, unless noted) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | $79.07$ B |
| **PLUS: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $0.721$ B |
| **LESS: Total Principal Amount of Debt** | $95.1$ B |
| **Total Equity Value** | **-$15.309 B** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | $142.2$ million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **-$107.66** |

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated Fair Value Per Share for Charter Communications, Inc. is **-$107.66**, primarily due to the company's massive debt load.

**Current Stock Price:** The current stock price for Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR) is approximately **$301.99** per share (as of November 8, 2024).

**Justification for the Valuation Discrepancy:**

The fundamental disconnect between the calculated **Negative Fair Value** (due to a high Net Debt position) and the **Market Price** ($\approx \$302$) is explained by the market's assumptions about:

1.  **Sustained Net Income and Capital Structure:** The market is not valuing CHTR based on its book equity (which is negative due to aggressive share buybacks and high debt) but on its *Free Cash Flow* (FCF) generation. CHTR's high debt is an intentional part of its capital structure strategy, using debt to fund its significant share buyback program and high-ROI investments like RDOF and network evolution. The market is assuming that CHTR will continue to generate a high level of FCF, which is not fully captured by Net Income in the DCF.
    *   *Our conservative FCF proxy (Net Income + ROIC)* is only \$6.25 B by 2030. The market assumes a far higher perpetual cash flow stream, likely based on **Adjusted EBITDA** less **Maintenance Capex** (ignoring Growth Capex for RDOF/Network evolution, assuming this is a temporary, high-ROI spend).
2.  **Network Evolution and Mobile Monetization:** The market is pricing in the long-term, high-ROI success of the current capital-intensive phase:
    *   **Post-2026 FCF Surge:** The market expects FCF to *surge* after 2026 when the high capital spending on RDOF (which is currently a drag on FCF, at $\approx\$4.5 B$ annually) and network evolution ends.
    *   **Mobile Upsell/ARPU:** The market believes the mobile segment's high growth (37.6% revenue growth) and low penetration (13%) will successfully convert the entire Internet base over time, creating a new, highly profitable, and sticky revenue stream.

**The Valuator's Conservative Case vs. The Market's Assumptions:**

*   **Our Valuation (Net Income Based):** The **$95.1 B$ debt** dominates the valuation. Net Income is a conservative proxy for FCF as it includes high, temporary (or accelerating) depreciation/amortization related to the high current CapEx. Our DCF model fails to capture the significant FCF accretion when this CapEx inevitably falls (post-2026) while the depreciation continues.
*   **Market's Valuation (FCF Based):** The market essentially views the $\approx \$12$ B in 2024 CapEx as mostly **Growth CapEx** (RDOF, Network Evolution), which it *adds back* to Net Income/EBITDA to get to an "FCF to Equity." The market assumes a long-term normalized CapEx/depreciation (Maintenance CapEx) that is much lower, leading to a much higher FCF estimate than our Net Income proxy.

In summary, the stock trades at a premium to our conservative valuation because investors are willing to pay for a company that aggressively deploys debt and future cash flow for value-accretive buybacks and temporary, high-ROI network investments, expecting a major **Free Cash Flow inflection point** post-2026.
