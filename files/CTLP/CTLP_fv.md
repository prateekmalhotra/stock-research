### II. Business Engine and Conservative Revenue/Margin Projections (FY2025 - FY2030)

Cantaloupe's business engine is defined by a high-margin, recurring revenue Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and transaction-processing model, supported by initial equipment sales. The key growth drivers are:
1.  **Increase in Active Devices/Customers:** Expanding its presence in the unattended retail market (vending, micro markets, smart stores).
2.  **Increase in Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU):** Driven by a higher take rate from transaction processing, higher average ticket sizes, and new value-added services (e.g., AdVantage, Cantaloupe Capital).

#### A. Revenue Projections (FY2025 - FY2030)

Management has provided strong guidance for FY2025, which serves as the anchor for the projections.

*   **FY2025 Guidance (Midpoint):** Total Revenue of \$315M (range \$308M-\$322M). Subscription/Transaction revenue growth of 15%-20%.

| Year | Revenue Driver: | Assumptions & Justification | Revenue Projection (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | **Management Guidance** | Use the conservative end of the guidance range: **\$308M**. | **308.0** |
| **FY2026** | **Growth Slowdown (Conservative)** | Assume a conservative, but still strong, growth rate. Given the uncertainty of the pending acquisition, I will temper the growth from 15%+ to **12.0%**. This reflects continued organic growth in devices and ARPU but a more cautious M&A environment. | 308.0 * 1.120 = **345.0** |
| **FY2027** | **Post-Acquisition Uncertainty/Maturity** | Assume a further, more conservative slowdown to **10.0%**. This rate is above market inflation and suggests healthy market penetration but reflects a conservative view on expansion over time. | 345.0 * 1.100 = **379.5** |
| **FY2028** | **Maturing Market** | Slowdown to **8.0%**. | 379.5 * 1.080 = **409.9** |
| **FY2029** | **Conservative Long-Term Growth** | Slowdown to **6.0%**. | 409.9 * 1.060 = **434.5** |
| **FY2030** | **Steady State** | Slowdown to **5.0%**. | 434.5 * 1.050 = **456.2** |

#### B. Net Income Margin Projections (FY2025 - FY2030)

The company has a high-margin subscription business (Q2 FY2025 Adjusted Gross Margin: 89.7%). Management guides for FY2025 US GAAP Net Income between \$22M and \$32M.

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | US GAAP Net Income Guidance (\$M) | Implied/Assumed Net Income Margin (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | 308.0 | **22.0** (Conservative Low End) | 7.14% (22.0 / 308.0) |
| **FY2026** | 345.0 | N/A | **8.00%** (Slight margin expansion due to operating leverage on high-margin recurring revenue) |
| **FY2027** | 379.5 | N/A | **9.00%** (Continued modest leverage as SaaS/Transaction revenue grows faster than equipment sales) |
| **FY2028** | 409.9 | N/A | **9.50%** |
| **FY2029** | 434.5 | N/A | **10.00%** |
| **FY2030** | 456.2 | N/A | **10.00%** |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for the following year will be calculated as:
*   *Net Income (t) = (Net Income from Projections (t)) + (Net Income from Prior Year (t-1) * ROIC)*

A Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is needed. Given past profitability is guided to be positive and growing, I will use a **conservative, but reasonable ROIC of 5.0%** for new cash flows, reflecting a cautious rate of return on reinvested profits, which is a blend of their high-return software business and lower-return equipment sales/cash holdings.

#### A. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow Proxy)

| Year (Fiscal Year Ending June 30) | Revenue (\$M) | Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income from Projections (\$M) | ROIC from Prior Year's Cash (\$M) | **Total Net Income / Cash Flow Proxy (\$M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 308.0 | 7.14% | 22.00 | N/A | **22.00** |
| **2026** | 345.0 | 8.00% | 27.60 | 22.00 * 5.0% = 1.10 | **28.70** |
| **2027** | 379.5 | 9.00% | 34.16 | 28.70 * 5.0% = 1.44 | **35.60** |
| **2028** | 409.9 | 9.50% | 38.94 | 35.60 * 5.0% = 1.78 | **40.72** |
| **2029** | 434.5 | 10.00% | 43.45 | 40.72 * 5.0% = 2.04 | **45.49** |
| **2030** | 456.2 | 10.00% | 45.62 | 45.49 * 5.0% = 2.27 | **47.89** |

#### B. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**. This is used to reflect the risk of a small-cap technology company.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth Rate):** **3.0%**. This is a conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above global inflation, representing the business growing at a pace slightly exceeding the broader economy.

**Terminal Value (TV) at the end of 2030:**
*   TV = \[Cash Flow Proxy (2030) \* (1 + Maturity Rate)\] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = \[47.89 \* (1 + 0.03)\] / (0.10 - 0.03)
*   TV = \[49.33] / 0.07 = **\$704.70 million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (Discounted to present value - T=0):**

| Year (t) | Cash Flow Proxy (\$M) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^t) | Discounted Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | 22.00 | 0.9091 | 20.00 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | 28.70 | 0.8264 | 23.73 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | 35.60 | 0.7513 | 26.75 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | 40.72 | 0.6830 | 27.81 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | 45.49 | 0.6209 | 28.24 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | 47.89 | 0.5645 | 27.03 |
| **Terminal Value (T=6)** | 704.70 | 0.5645 | 397.87 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$551.43 million** |

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | \$551.43 |
| **ADD: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$27.68 |
| **SUBTRACT: Total Debt** | (\$39.16) |
| **Equity Value** | **\$539.95 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 73.72 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$7.32** |

---

### V. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated DCF Fair Value Per Share** | **\$7.32** |
| **Current Market Stock Price** | **\$10.70** |
| **Pending Acquisition Price Per Share** | **\$11.50** |

The calculated fair value of **\$7.32 per share** is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$10.70** and the pending all-cash acquisition price of **\$11.50**.

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

The market is currently pricing CTLP stock based almost entirely on the pending all-cash acquisition.

1.  **Market Arbitrage:** The price of \$10.70 is only about 7% lower than the \$11.50 acquisition price. This discount represents the market's perceived risk that the merger with 365 Retail Markets, LLC will *not* close (e.g., due to regulatory clearance issues, like the mentioned FTC Second Request) and the company would revert to a price closer to its standalone fundamental valuation.
2.  **Market Assumptions vs. DCF Assumptions:**
    *   **Market Assumption (Acquisition):** The market assumes the company's value is **\$11.50 per share**, realizing a significant premium over the DCF calculation.
    *   **Market Assumption (Standalone):** The market's *standalone* valuation, implied by the \$10.70 price, is still significantly higher than the DCF. This suggests that the market's *long-term growth* and/or *margin* assumptions are much more aggressive than the conservative figures used in this DCF. The market likely assumes:
        *   **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate:** A more bullish view on active device expansion and ARPU growth through new products like Smart Store and AdVantage, potentially seeing 10%+ growth continuing past FY2028, or a higher Terminal Value growth rate (Maturity Rate).
        *   **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower cost of capital (Discount Rate) than 10.0%, perhaps closer to 8.0%, suggesting a lower risk profile due to the increasingly sticky, high-margin recurring revenue model.

**In summary, the DCF calculation of \$7.32 is a conservative fundamental valuation for CTLP as a standalone company. The current market price of \$10.70 is a function of a near-term arbitrage opportunity, effectively pricing the stock at the acquisition value of \$11.50 less the risk of the deal failing.**
