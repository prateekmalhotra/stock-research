## II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

Cantaloupe's business is driven by three segments: high-margin **Transaction** and **Subscription** revenue (SaaS and processing fees) and low-margin **Equipment** sales (card readers, Smart Stores). The core high-margin business is fueled by the number of Active Devices and the Annual Revenue Per Unit (ARPU).

**Business Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Core Revenue Growth (Transaction + Subscription):** This is the high-margin, scalable part of the business.
    *   **FY2025 Guidance:** 15% to 20% growth. I will be conservative and use the low end of the guidance for FY2025 and a gradual, yet conservative, slowdown in subsequent years, reflecting increasing market penetration and competition.
    *   The primary driver is the increase in ARPU (up 12% Y/Y in Q2 2025) due to new, higher-ticket products like **Smart Store** and cross-sell of software/micromarkets, and the ancillary revenue streams like **Cantaloupe Capital** and **Advantage**.

2.  **Equipment Revenue Growth:** This is the low-margin segment, which management has shown willingness to sacrifice for higher-margin Subscription/Transaction growth. Equipment revenue declined 7.4% in Q2 FY2025, despite the success of Smart Store sales.
    *   I will assume this segment remains flat for the projection period, reflecting a mix of new device roll-outs and ongoing low-margin price pressure.

3.  **Gross Margin:** Margins are expanding due to scale and favorable revenue mix shift toward Transaction/Subscription revenue.
    *   **Subscription GM:** 90.7% (Q3 FY2025). I will conservatively maintain this at **90.0%**.
    *   **Transaction GM:** 24.8% (Q3 FY2025). This has been rapidly expanding. I will project a modest expansion to **26.0%** by 2030, reflecting better cost management and transaction routing.
    *   **Equipment GM:** 9.1% (Q2 FY2025). I will project a conservative expansion to **10.0%** by 2030.

4.  **Operating Expenses (OpEx):** OpEx leverage is key. Historically, management has managed SG&A, though acquisitions (like CHEQ) cause short-term increases [cite: 7 in previous step, 7]. I will project a gradual decrease in OpEx as a percentage of revenue, moving from a projected FY2025 figure to a mature SaaS-like margin.

5.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Based on the principle of projecting a reasonable positive ROIC. A conservative, yet realistic, reinvestment rate for a growing, profitable SaaS-focused technology company is **10.0%**.

6.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** Given the company's size, growth stage, and the volatility of the tech sector, a high, conservative discount rate is appropriate. I will use **11.0%**.

7.  **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** This represents the long-term, stable growth rate of the business after the projection period. A highly conservative rate, slightly above long-term inflation, is appropriate. I will use **2.0%**.

### A. Revenue and Margin Projections

| Year (Fiscal) | 2025 (Guide) | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| *Y/Y Growth (Assumption)* | 15.0% | 10.0% | 8.0% | 7.2% | 6.0% | 5.0% |
| **Equipment Revenue** | \$42.0 | \$42.0 | \$42.0 | \$42.0 | \$42.0 | \$42.0 |
| *Y/Y Growth (Assumption)* | -10.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| **Total Revenue** | **\$325.0** | **\$353.3** | **\$378.2** | **\$402.7** | **\$424.3** | **\$443.4** |

| **Gross Margin %** | **41.0%** | **41.5%** | **42.0%** | **42.5%** | **43.0%** | **43.5%** |
| **Gross Profit** | **\$133.2** | **\$146.4** | **\$158.8** | **\$171.1** | **\$182.5** | **\$192.9** |
| | | | | | | |
| **Operating Exp. % of Revenue**| 31.1% | 30.5% | 30.0% | 29.5% | 29.0% | 28.5% |
| **Operating Expenses** | \$101.2 | \$107.8 | \$113.5 | \$118.8 | \$123.1 | \$126.4 |
| **Operating Income (EBIT)** | **\$32.0** | **\$38.6** | **\$45.3** | **\$52.3** | **\$59.4** | **\$66.5** |
| | | | | | | |
| **Tax Rate** | 15.0% | 20.0% | 21.0% | 21.0% | 21.0% | 21.0% |
| **Net Income (Initial)** | **\$27.2** | **\$30.9** | **\$35.8** | **\$41.3** | **\$47.0** | **\$52.5** |

*Note: FY2025 Gross Margin of 41.0% is a conservative estimate given the 41.6% in Q3 2025. The Operating Expense % is derived from an implied OpEx of (Revenue - Adj. EBITDA / Margin) from the guidance.*

### B. Projected Cash Flow and Terminal Value

The assumption is that net income (as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity) goes straight into cash for the next year, and the cash earns additional income via ROIC.

| Year (Fiscal) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income (Initial)** | \$27.2 | \$30.9 | \$35.8 | \$41.3 | \$47.0 | \$52.5 |
| **Beginning Cash** | \$51.15 | \$78.35 | \$111.34 | \$149.38 | \$192.51 | \$243.21 |
| *Cash from NI (Previous Year)* | *(\$51.15 M from June 2025 Balance Sheet)* | \$27.20 | \$30.99 | \$35.81 | \$41.31 | \$47.02 |
| **ROIC % (Conservative)** | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% | 10.0% |
| **ROIC Income** | *N/A* | \$7.8 | \$11.1 | \$14.9 | \$19.3 | \$24.3 |
| **Adjusted Cash Flow (FCFE)**| **\$27.2** | **\$38.7** | **\$47.0** | **\$56.2** | **\$66.3** | **\$76.8** |
| | | | | | | |
| **Discount Factor (11.0%)** | 0.901 | 0.812 | 0.731 | 0.659 | 0.593 | 0.535 |
| **NPV of Cash Flow** | **\$24.5** | **\$31.4** | **\$34.4** | **\$37.0** | **\$39.3** | **\$41.1** |

*Note: Adjusted Cash Flow = Net Income (Initial) + ROIC Income (from previous year's total cash balance, excluding current year's NI).*

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value (TV) is the value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).

*   **Final Cash Flow:** \$76.8 M
*   **Maturity Rate (g):** 2.0%
*   **Discount Rate (r):** 11.0%
*   **Terminal Value (2030) Formula:** FCFE2030 * (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** \$76.8 M * (1.02) / (0.11 - 0.02) = **\$870.9 M**

### D. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

*   **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** \$24.5 + \$31.4 + \$34.4 + \$37.0 + \$39.3 + \$41.1 = **\$207.7 M**
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (Today):** \$870.9 M * 0.535 (Discount Factor for 2030) = **\$466.0 M**
*   **Total Enterprise Value (NPV of all Future Cash Flows):** \$207.7 M + \$466.0 M = **\$673.7 M**

## IV. Fair Value Per Share

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (NPV)** | \$673.7 M |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$51.15 M |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | (\$38.66 M) |
| **Equity Value** | **\$686.19 M** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 73.37 M |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$9.35** |

## V. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: \$9.35**

**Current Stock Price (Ref): \$10.58**

### Discrepancy Justification

The calculated intrinsic fair value of **\$9.35** is approximately **11.6% lower** than the current market price of **\$10.58**.

**The market is making a clear assumption about a Corporate Action:**

The most significant factor overriding any pure intrinsic DCF valuation is the publicly announced definitive agreement for Cantaloupe to be acquired by 365 Retail Markets, LLC, for approximately **\$830 million**.

*   The implied acquisition price per share would be **\$11.31** (\$830M / 73.37M shares).

The market price of **\$10.58** is trading at a discount to the announced acquisition price of \$11.31 per share.

*   **Market Assumption:** The market is pricing the stock to reflect a high probability of the merger closing (which would result in a gain for shareholders at the acquisition price), offset by a small discount reflecting the **risk** of the deal falling through (in which case the stock would likely trade closer to the calculated intrinsic value of \$9.35, or potentially lower).

**Why the Intrinsic Value is Lower:**

My conservative DCF valuation, which assumes the business continues as an independent, publicly traded entity, is lower than the acquisition price because:

1.  **Conservative Projections:** My revenue growth rates slow down more aggressively (to 5.0% by 2030) than an aggressive investor might project, and the OpEx leverage (moving to a 28.5% OpEx/Revenue by 2030) is also conservative for a true SaaS-like business.
2.  **ROIC:** The 10.0% ROIC is a reasonable, conservative reinvestment assumption, but a company generating high-margin SaaS revenue could arguably sustain a higher ROIC in a non-dilutive reinvestment scenario.
3.  **Risk Acknowledgment:** The valuation does not account for the immediate synergistic value that an acquirer like 365 Retail Markets would immediately unlock.

**Conclusion:**

The intrinsic value of **\$9.35** represents the baseline value of the company's future cash flows based on conservative, independent operation projections. The current market price of **\$10.58** strongly suggests that the market has factored in the announced merger, and the stock is trading as an **arbitrage opportunity** on the closing of the **\$11.31 per share** acquisition.
