## Business Summary

Civista Bancshares operates a regional community bank primarily focused on serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses across Ohio, with smaller operations in Indiana and Kentucky. The core business model involves collecting money from customers via checking, savings, and certificate accounts (deposits) and then utilizing those funds to issue various loans, mainly for commercial real estate, residential mortgages, and business needs. The bank's main source of profit is the 'spread' or difference between the higher interest rates it charges on the loans it issues and the lower interest rates it pays out to its depositors. Secondary revenue streams include various banking and wealth management service fees.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for the bank is credit risk; if economic conditions worsen, customers may struggle to repay their loans, resulting in losses for the bank. This type of failure to repay peaked dramatically during the 2008 financial crisis, and it remains a constant threat during periods of high economic uncertainty. Another immediate risk is interest rate volatility. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates quickly, the bank must increase the rates paid on customer deposits to retain them, which rapidly shrinks the profit margin if the income earned on existing long-term loans remains fixed. Long-term risks include geographic concentration risk, as the bank’s earnings are tied mainly to the health of the regional economy in Ohio. A localized economic shock, such as a major employer leaving the area, would disproportionately harm the bank’s financial health compared to a nationally diversified institution.

### **History of Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB): From Local Roots to Regional Growth**

#### **I. The Inception and Core Mission (1884 - Mid-1980s)**

1.  **Founding a Community Institution (1884):** The company began in Sandusky, Ohio, as the Citizens National Bank, with the fundamental goal of serving the local community by providing essential banking services to businesses and residents.
2.  **Maintaining Core Identity:** Even as it grew, the institution was built on the principle of "community banking," emphasizing a deep commitment to local decision-making and strong personal relationships with its customers.
3.  **Early Resilience (Headwind):** The bank demonstrated strength and stability by successfully navigating through major national economic crises, including the Great Depression of the 1930s.
4.  **Creating a Parent Company (1985):** The organization formally created a financial holding company named Citizens Banking Corporation to serve as the parent company for the bank, which allowed for a broader strategy of growth through mergers and acquisitions.

#### **II. Strategic Expansion and Rebranding (1990s - Present)**

5.  **A Consistent Growth Strategy (Tailwind):** Starting in the 1990s, the company capitalized on the industry trend of bank consolidation by executing a long series of strategic acquisitions, which helped them expand their network and asset base across Ohio.
6.  **Addressing an Identity Crisis (Headwind & Solution - 2015):** The long-standing name, Citizens Banking Corporation, became a major brand headwind because over 300 other banks in the United States had "Citizens" in their name.
7.  **The Innovative Rebranding Solution (2015):** The company officially changed its name to **Civista Bancshares, Inc.**, and the bank became Civista Bank. The new name is a blend of "civic" (denoting community) and "vista" (signifying view or focus), which uniquely captured the company's commitment to customers and community.
8.  **Expanding Regionally (Tailwind):** Post-rebranding, the aggressive acquisition strategy continued, expanding their reach across state lines into Southeastern Indiana and Northern Kentucky, further establishing the company as a disciplined regional bank consolidator.

#### **III. Modern Challenges and Innovative Solutions**

9.  **Overcoming Operational Drag (Problem & Solution):** Rapid growth led to a process-based problem (headwind) where paper documents for commercial loans became inefficient, delaying service and requiring employees to physically search for files.
10. **The Digital Workflow Solution:** Civista implemented a digital document management system to automate workflows and digitize files, allowing employees to access information instantly while on the phone with clients, significantly speeding up the lending process and improving customer experience.
11. **Responding to Global Crisis (Headwind & Solution - 2020):** During the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Civista was a vital community resource. It quickly approved thousands of government-backed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and granted payment deferrals on commercial loans to help local businesses and families survive the uncertainty.
12. **Diversifying Revenue Streams (Tailwind/Solution):** To build a more robust company model, they strategically diversified their services beyond traditional banking. In 2022, they acquired Vision Financial Group, a move that launched their specialized commercial equipment leasing business which operates nationwide, providing a new source of loan and lease income.
13. **Navigating Interest Rate Pressure (Headwind & Solution - Current):** In periods of high interest rates, the bank faced the headwind of increased deposit costs due to competition, which squeezed their profits. Management proactively responded by focusing on high-growth areas like commercial loans and leases, increasing non-interest income through cross-selling, and strategically prepaying high-rate debt to save on future interest expenses.

#### **IV. The Company Today and Its Goal**

14. **Current Status:** Civista Bancshares, Inc. is a financial holding company for Civista Bank, offering a full range of services including commercial and consumer lending, mortgage services, wealth management, and commercial equipment leasing.
15. **The Ultimate Goal:** The overall goal remains consistent with its founding: to be a reliable and trusted partner for its customers and the vitality of its communities, while delivering sustainable value and growth to its shareholders.

## Moat Analysis

An analysis of the competitive advantages, or "moat," for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB), a community bank, shows that its defense against competitors is built on a localized, relationship-driven strategy combined with specialized lending and operational efficiency, rather than proprietary technology or mass-market scale.

### The Moat of Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB)

The company's competitive advantage primarily stems from **high customer switching costs**, an **intangible asset** in the form of a strong local brand and reputation, and a **cost advantage** in its funding and operational processes.

#### 1. Switching Costs and Customer Stickiness

*   **Relationship Banking is the Core Moat:** Civista's strategy is built on "relationship banking" and "personalized service," which makes customers—especially small to medium-sized businesses—highly sticky. Switching banks for a commercial loan or complex business account involves significant effort, paperwork, and disruption, which creates a high switching cost.
*   **High Customer Loyalty:** The effectiveness of this approach is backed by customer data, with surveys indicating an overall satisfaction and loyalty score of over 90%, and over 81% of surveyed customers considering Civista Bank their primary financial institution. These long-term, multi-product relationships ensure recurring revenue.
*   **Specialized and Sticky Products:** Its lending portfolio is heavily focused on commercial real estate and commercial and agricultural loans, which are inherently sticky due to their complexity and multi-year terms. The nationwide **Commercial Equipment Leasing and Finance Division** (acquired in 2022) diversifies its revenue outside its core region and provides a specialized product line that is less susceptible to purely local competition.

#### 2. Differentiation from Competitors

*   **Local Focus vs. National Scale:** Civista differentiates itself from large, national and regional banks by offering a "community bank feel" with deep local roots in its markets in Ohio, Southeastern Indiana, and Northern Kentucky. While national banks compete on low-cost digital services, Civista competes on personalized service, convenience, and responsiveness.
*   **Cost Advantage from Core Deposits:** A key defense against rivals is its **low-cost, locally generated deposit base**, which is a crucial source of cheap funding for its loans. This is a form of cost advantage over competitors who might rely more heavily on higher-cost, market-rate funding sources.
*   **Experienced Acquirer:** Civista has a history of strategic acquisitions (six since 2007) to drive growth and expand its footprint in attractive Ohio lending markets like Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati, which is a key differentiator from banks that rely solely on organic growth.

#### 3. Pricing Power and Market Position

*   **Localized Pricing Power:** As a community bank, Civista generally faces intense competition, limiting broad pricing power. However, its pricing power exists in the local niches where relationships are strongest. A loyal customer with a long-standing history may be willing to accept a slightly higher loan rate or lower deposit rate to maintain the superior, personalized service, flexibility, and quick decision-making that a community bank offers.
*   **Special Position in the Market:** The combination of a highly localized, high-touch community bank franchise and a geographically broader, specialized commercial equipment leasing division gives it a unique position. The leasing business is a product that differentiates it from a typical local bank.

#### 4. Displaceability, Innovation, and Growth

*   **Displaceability is Difficult but Possible:** The bank's moat is "soft," built on human relationships and local reputation. A competitor with significantly more capital could try to displace Civista by flooding its markets with much lower prices or spending heavily on marketing and technology. However, the deep community ties, employee loyalty, and the high switching costs of existing commercial clients make an immediate displacement very difficult.
*   **Reason for Growth (The Past):** The company's growth into a $\sim\$4.1 billion financial holding company is largely attributed to its founding in 1884, its long history of community commitment, its dedication to disciplined financial performance, and a strategy of growth through both strong organic lending and targeted acquisitions.
*   **R&D and Innovation:** Civista does not have a formal, large "R\&D" department in the traditional sense, as is typical for banks. Instead, its innovation focuses on **operational efficiency and customer digital experience**.
    *   **Past/Current Efforts:** It has invested in a digital transformation to enhance convenience and flexibility for customers and has focused on process improvements, such as digitizing commercial lending documents to ensure faster response times and better service. It has also formed an "Innovation ERG (Employee Resource Group)" to challenge employees to bring ideas for robotic automation and digital capabilities to the forefront of the bank's strategy.
    *   **Need for Innovation:** Civista must constantly innovate on the customer-facing technology front (online/mobile banking) to simply **keep up** with national banks. However, its competitive *edge* remains its personalized service and strong relationships, which technology is used to support, not replace.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for an increase in Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB) stock price are tied to the execution of its growth strategy, deposit base improvement, and recovering profit margins.

## Catalysts for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB)

### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Expansion:** Management has stated that the net interest margin is expected to continue expanding over the next few quarters after reaching its lowest point in the second quarter of 2024. This signals improving profitability as the bank better manages its funding costs relative to loan yields.
2.  **Successful Integration of Acquisition:** The announced acquisition of The Farmers Savings Bank is expected to immediately benefit the company by providing an inflow of low-cost core deposits. Leveraging these deposits is a crucial near-term catalyst to fund continued loan growth.
3.  **Core Deposit Growth Initiatives:** Efforts to attract lower-cost funds, such as the Ohio Homebuyers Plus program and a new digital deposit account platform, are ongoing. Management is focused on increasing core deposit funding to reduce reliance on higher-cost wholesale funding.
4.  **Earnings Recovery Post-Transition:** The company spent 2024 transitioning and replacing lost revenue and noninterest-bearing funding from an exited relationship with an income tax refund processor. Sustained year-over-year earnings growth in 2025 and beyond, as seen in recent quarters, suggests a successful replacement of this business.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Strategic Acquisitions and Capital Utilization:** Management's overall goal is to maintain and grow capital to support both organic growth and potential future acquisitions. The recent capital raise and acquisition show a commitment to strategic expansion, which can increase the company's size and market share over time.
2.  **Sustained Organic Loan Growth with Discipline:** Civista continues to see strong loan demand across its markets, with an emphasis on disciplined pricing to ensure appropriate returns. Long-term growth is expected to come from expanding its lending, particularly in areas like residential real estate and construction financing.
3.  **Stable Credit Quality:** Despite national economic uncertainties, management notes that the economy in its key operating regions (Ohio and Southeastern Indiana) remains strong and credit quality is holding steady. Maintaining a strong credit quality profile is key to long-term financial health and investor confidence.
4.  **Dividend Policy:** The company's recent increase in its quarterly dividend demonstrates confidence in future earnings and is a strategy to balance growth support with returning value to shareholders.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of management incentive and compensation for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB) is based on the company's recent proxy statements (DEF 14A).

### **1. Management and Director Ownership (Insider Ownership)**

*   **Low Individual Ownership:** The beneficial ownership for many individual directors and named executive officers is often reported as less than one percent (<1%) of the outstanding common shares.
*   **Implied Group Ownership:** The group ownership percentage for all directors and executive officers is not explicitly stated in the public snippets, but the prevalence of individual holdings below 1% suggests a relatively low overall insider ownership percentage, particularly when compared to companies with high founder or family involvement.
*   **Shareholder Alignment (Ownership):** While a higher percentage of insider ownership is generally better for aligning interests, the compensation structure appears to be the primary method for linking management's wealth to shareholder returns rather than reliance on massive founder/director stock holdings.

### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

The executive compensation program is described as including variable components (incentives) to ensure a significant portion of an executive's total compensation is tied to the corporation's performance and is intended to increase value to shareholders.

*   **Compensation Components:** The structure is composed of three main elements: base salary, annual cash incentives, and long-term equity incentives.
*   **Annual Cash Incentive Metrics (Short-Term Focus):** The performance measures for the annual cash bonus are linked to key operational and profitability metrics, including **Net Income**, **Efficiency Ratio**, **End of Year Core Deposits**, and **Total Loans (Booked and Sold)**.
    *   *Analysis:* These metrics balance profitability (Net Income) and operational health (Efficiency, Deposits, Loans), which generally encourages sound banking practices over extreme risk-taking.
*   **Long-Term Equity Incentive Metrics (Shareholder Focus):** The long-term incentives are granted in the form of restricted common shares that vest over a three-year period, directly linking them to sustained performance. The key performance metrics for the equity awards are:
    *   **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** (compared to a three-year average of a peer group).
    *   **Return on Average Equity (ROAE).**
    *   *Analysis:* Tying a portion of compensation to **Relative TSR** is a strong mechanism that incentivizes executives to outperform their competitors, directly aligning their success with the appreciation of the shareholder's investment over multiple years.

### **3. Conclusion on Management Incentives and Alignment**

*   **Incentive Alignment is Strong via Compensation:** The executive compensation program is structured to incentivize management to act in the interest of shareholders, primarily through the use of **performance-based long-term equity** that uses **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** and **ROAE** as key metrics.
*   **Balance of Short-Term and Long-Term Goals:** The combination of annual cash incentives tied to operational measures (Net Income, Efficiency Ratio) and multi-year equity incentives tied to market and financial return measures (TSR, ROAE) promotes a balanced view. It incentivizes both the short-term goal of improving core bank performance and the long-term goal of increasing shareholder value.
*   **Mitigation of 'Lining Own Pockets':** The heavy reliance on relative performance (TSR vs. peers) and multi-year vesting of equity makes it difficult for managers to simply line their own pockets, as their ultimate payoff depends on the company's stock price performance and financial returns relative to the market over time.

## Price History

The following is an analysis of the price history and technical standing for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB).

### **Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB) Price & Technical Analysis**

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is currently trading significantly closer to the middle of its 52-week range rather than its low, with a 52-week high of **$25.59** and a 52-week low of **$16.89**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Civista Bancshares, Inc. is currently trading approximately **23.09%** above its 52-week low of $16.89.

3.  **Technical Analysis Sentiment (Trading Low?):** The technical indicators present a mixed to "Hold" signal, suggesting the stock is not definitively "trading low" from a short-term momentum perspective, but it is undervalued compared to analyst targets.
    *   The stock is currently trading above several short-term exponential moving averages (E.g., 5-day, 10-day, 20-day), which can indicate a short-term **uptrend**.
    *   However, it is trading below longer-term simple moving averages (E.g., 50-day, 100-day, 200-day), which often suggests a **longer-term downtrend** or consolidation.
    *   Analyst consensus is generally a **"Buy"** or **"Hold"**, with an average 12-month price target that suggests a significant upside of over 23% from the current price, indicating it may be undervalued on a fundamental basis.

### **Analysis of Big Drops or Gains in Recent Months**

4.  **Significant 12-Month Gain:** Over the last 12 months, the stock price has appreciated by nearly **25%**, representing a substantial gain. This strong annual performance is largely attributed to consistent positive financial reports.

5.  **Big Gain Driver (Q2 2025 Earnings):** The company announced its Second Quarter 2025 financial results on July 24, 2025, reporting net income of $0.71 per common share, which was a significant **58% increase** compared to the same quarter in the prior year.

6.  **Recent Pullback/Mixed Reaction:** Despite the robust year-over-year earnings growth, the stock has recently pulled back from higher prices (like the 52-week high of $25.59). The Q2 2025 EPS of $0.66 *missed* some consensus estimates of $0.69, and revenue also missed, which can lead to selling pressure and a short-term drop or stagnation in price.

---

## Long Thesis

Civista Bancshares is poised for strong growth and improved profitability. In the near term, profit margins will expand because management is successfully replacing high-cost funding with cheaper core customer deposits, boosted by the immediate inflow of low-cost money from the recently acquired Farmers Savings Bank. The company is also enhancing efficiency by launching a new digital platform. Long term, the company will continue to generate stable earnings by leveraging its unique competitive advantages: deep, high-switching-cost relationships with business clients, and the diversification provided by its successful nationwide commercial equipment leasing division. Management is proven to be a disciplined 'Midwest consolidator,' and its ongoing strategy of acquiring and integrating smaller banks efficiently will increase market share, leading to sustained earnings per share growth and higher returns for shareholders.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several key conditions: 1) The general economic health of the Midwest markets (Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky) must remain strong, preventing loan defaults and maintaining credit quality. 2) Management must successfully integrate current and future acquisitions (like Farmers Savings Bank) quickly and without significant costs or operational delays, realizing the expected earnings benefits. 3) The interest rate environment must stabilize, allowing the bank's profit margins to actually expand as forecast. 4) The company’s focus on personalized relationship banking must continue to effectively defend its core business against competition from larger national banks.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several flaws and points of weakness in the provided long thesis for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB), leading to a contrasting bear case.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **Faulty Credit Quality Assumption:** The thesis assumes that the economic health of the Midwest will "preventing loan defaults and maintaining credit quality," but recent financial data shows a significant deterioration in credit metrics. Non-performing assets (NPAs) at the end of 2024 increased by **111%** year-over-year to \$31.9 million, suggesting that loan defaults are, in fact, rising and credit quality is under pressure.
2.  **Acquisition Dilution and Risk:** While the Farmers Savings Bank (FSB) acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by approximately 10% once cost savings are "fully realized," it introduces immediate risks. The deal involves an underwritten public offering of common shares, which is **dilutive** to current shareholders, and the anticipated recovery of tangible book value dilution is projected to take a relatively long **three years**.
3.  **Profit Margin Expansion is a Recovery, Not Pure Growth:** The premise of expanding profit margins is more accurately a recovery from recent pressure, not just organic growth. The net interest margin (NIM) was significantly compressed from 4.11% in Q1 2023 down to 3.09% in Q2 2024 due to high funding costs, before recovering to 3.64% in Q2 2025. This means the bank is fighting to regain prior profitability, a more volatile and less certain path than simple expansion.
4.  **Operational Risks from Integration and Digital Transition:** The supposed efficiency gains from the new digital platform and acquisitions come with short-term costs and execution risk. The company recently reported a \$1.6 million non-recurring adjustment expense related to a core system conversion in the Leasing and Finance Division, indicating that operational streamlining efforts can cause immediate, unexpected costs and disruptions.
5.  **Weakening Core Deposit Indicator:** The claim of "successfully replacing high-cost funding with cheaper core customer deposits" is partially contradicted by a \$46.4 million decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits in Q1 2025, largely due to a loss in commercial business deposits. This suggests a weakening of the most valuable, low-cost core funding source, requiring the bank to rely on more expensive interest-bearing deposits and wholesale funding.
6.  **"Midwest Consolidator" Strategy is Highly Rate-Dependent:** The strategy of being a disciplined "Midwest consolidator" relies heavily on favorable M\&A valuations and seamless integration. Given the volatile interest rate environment and the recent need to raise capital through a dilutive stock offering for the FSB acquisition, the capital base could be strained, making future, low-risk acquisitions harder to execute or more costly.
7.  **Increased Competition Erosion of "Deep Relationships":** The assumption that "personalized relationship banking" will effectively defend its core business against larger national banks is a weak competitive moat in the digital age. Large banks and FinTechs offer sophisticated digital platforms and high deposit rates that can challenge customer loyalty, especially for transaction-based small business accounts, which are increasingly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB)**

Civista Bancshares faces significant downside risk due to deteriorating credit quality and persistent funding pressures that threaten to counteract the benefits of its acquisition strategy, leading to muted earnings growth and potential capital strain.

1.  **Credit Deterioration & Reserve Adequacy:** The massive year-over-year increase in non-performing assets, paired with a substantial drop in the allowance for credit losses relative to non-performing loans, signals that credit quality is rapidly deteriorating. This increasing risk of loan defaults will force management to increase loan loss provisions, which will act as a direct and immediate drag on net income and earnings per share, regardless of deposit cost improvements.
2.  **Funding Cost Volatility and Core Deposit Flight:** Despite recent improvements in the net interest margin due to the paying down of *wholesale* funding, a key risk is the continued outflow of the cheapest funding—noninterest-bearing demand deposits. If the bank has to replace its most stable, non-interest-bearing commercial deposits with more expensive public funds or time deposits to sustain growth, net interest margin will remain volatile and compressed, limiting the expansion of profit margins in a sustained way.
3.  **Dilution and Integration Risk Overshadowing Accretion:** The serial acquisition strategy is now dependent on a dilutive common stock offering to fund the latest deal, effectively increasing the share count and raising the bar for EPS accretion. Any unforeseen integration costs, operational delays, or a failure to realize the full anticipated cost savings from the Farmers Savings Bank merger could result in an expensive, multi-year dilution of tangible book value without delivering the projected 10% earnings accretion, penalizing current shareholders.

## Next Steps

The provided analysis creates a clear debate between the bull and bear cases, with the core conflict centered on credit quality, acquisition risk/reward, and funding stability.

The initial search provided excellent, highly-relevant, and recent data (Q1 2025 and Q4 2024 results, and July 2025 news on the acquisition) which addresses several key questions, but also raises new ones.

### **Summary of New Information/Context**

*   **Credit Quality:** The most alarming **111% NPA increase** was from Dec 31, 2023, to Dec 31, 2024. However, the most recent data (March 31, 2025) shows non-performing assets (NPAs) actually **decreased by 4.4%** from the December 2024 peak. This suggests the credit picture is stabilizing or slightly improving *post-peak*, which tempers the bear case.
*   **FSB Acquisition:** The Farmers Savings Bank (FSB) deal was **announced in July 2025** and is expected to close in the **fourth quarter of 2025**. The deal involves a **dilutive common stock offering** of over 3.7 million shares to fund it and for general corporate purposes. The expected 10% EPS accretion and three-year tangible book value (TBV) earn-back are confirmed. This confirms the bear case's dilution risk is *active* and the catalyst is *pending*.
*   **Valuation/Analyst View:** The current P/E is around **8.24**, which is lower than its 12-month average (9.74). The analyst consensus is generally a "Moderate Buy" or "Hold," with an average price target of approximately **$24.67 - $25.50**, suggesting an upside of about 19% to 23%.

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

The following steps should focus on the remaining unknowns and the immediate implications of the new data.

1.  **Deep Dive into Specific Credit Risk Exposure**
    *   What are the specific loan categories driving the NPA increase from 2023 to 2024 (e.g., Commercial Real Estate, specific commercial loan types, or VFG-related leases)? The bear case highlights credit risk; knowing where the problem lies is crucial for predicting future losses.
    *   Investigate the **Commercial Equipment Leasing/VFG division's** asset quality specifically, as this is a nationwide, diversifying asset that has different risk dynamics from the core community bank. Is this segment contributing disproportionately to the recent stabilization/deterioration?

2.  **Evaluate the Real Cost of the Dilutive Acquisition (FSB)**
    *   Determine the current **Tangible Book Value (TBV)** per share (TBVPS). Then, estimate the pro forma TBVPS *immediately* after the dilutive equity offering and *before* the deal closes, as well as the expected TBVPS *immediately* after the FSB acquisition closes (including goodwill). This quantifies the price of the "Midwest consolidator" strategy for current shareholders.
    *   Search for details on the anticipated **cost savings** from the FSB acquisition. A 10% EPS accretion relies on these; understanding the source (e.g., branch closures, system consolidation) helps assess the risk of not achieving them.

3.  **Analyze Funding Structure and NIM Trajectory**
    *   While the NIM recovery is a bull catalyst, the bear case mentioned a decline in the cheapest funding source: **noninterest-bearing deposits**. Quantify the **current ratio of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits** and track its trend over the last 12-18 months. A continued decline would indicate persistent funding pressure.
    *   Search for management commentary on the expected **peak cost of funds** and the forecast for **net interest margin (NIM)** for the second half of 2025. This is the central operational question for all regional banks.

4.  **Compare Valuation to Peers**
    *   Find the **Price-to-Tangible Book Value (P/TBV)** and **P/E** multiples for a small peer group of similar-sized Midwest regional banks. A bank P/TBV of **1.0x** is often considered fair value for average performance. Compare CIVB's multiples to these peers to confirm if the stock is truly "undervalued" based on regional norms and the recent NPA stabilization.
