### **2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection**

PHINIA Inc. is a provider of premium fuel systems, electrical systems, and aftermarket solutions for combustion, hybrid, and alternative fuel applications in the Commercial Vehicle (CV), Industrial, and Light Vehicle segments.

The company's long-term strategy, as per management commentary, is explicitly structured around two core areas:
1.  **Growth Segment (~73% of Revenue):** Growing the CV, Industrial, and Aerospace Original Equipment (OE) business, along with high-margin Aftermarket and service offerings (historically representing $\approx\$2.5$ billion in annual revenue).
2.  **Maintenance Segment (~27% of Revenue):** Maintaining Light Vehicle OE sales (historically representing $\approx\$900$ million in annual revenue) through market share gains, despite the global shift towards electrification.
3.  **New Technology & Acquisitions:** Strategic expansion into alternative fuel technologies (e.g., hydrogen and natural gas ignition systems, supported by the SEM acquisition) and the launch of the first aerospace product in Q4 2025, which will be tailwinds for the Growth Segment.

| Year | Revenue Segment Breakdown (USD in Millions) | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | **3,400** (Reported Net Sales) | N/A |
| **2025** | **3,380** (Midpoint of \$3.33B - \$3.43B guidance) | -0.6% |

#### **Revenue Assumptions (2026-2030):**

1.  **Growth Segment (73% of 2024 Revenue $\approx\$2,482$ million):** A conservative growth rate of **3.5%** is assumed. This is backed by the strategic focus on CV/Industrial/Aftermarket (more stable/high-margin), the SEM acquisition for alternative fuels, and the new entry into the Aerospace market, all of which are management-guided areas of expansion.
2.  **Maintenance Segment (27% of 2024 Revenue $\approx\$918$ million):** A flat-to-slightly-declining growth rate of **-0.5%** is assumed. This reflects a conservative view on the Light Vehicle OE combustion market, partially offset by the management's goal to maintain volume through market share gains.
3.  **Blended Annual Revenue Growth:** The weighted average results in a conservative blended growth rate of approximately **2.5%** per year for 2026-2030.

| Year | Growth Segment Revenue (3.5% Growth) | Maintenance Segment Revenue (-0.5% Growth) | Total Revenue | Annual Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 2,467 | 913 | **3,380** | -0.6% |
| **2026** | 2,553 | 908 | **3,461** | 2.4% |
| **2027** | 2,642 | 904 | **3,546** | 2.5% |
| **2028** | 2,734 | 899 | **3,633** | 2.5% |
| **2029** | 2,830 | 895 | **3,725** | 2.5% |
| **2030** | 2,929 | 890 | **3,819** | 2.5% |

### **3. Net Income & Cash Flow Projection**

#### **Net Income Margin Assumptions:**

*   **2024 Net Income Margin:** 2.3%.
*   **2025 Net Income Margin:** The midpoint of management's guidance is $155$ million (\$140M - \$170M) on \$3,380M revenue, which is a **4.6%** margin. The significant year-over-year expansion is driven by pricing actions, supplier cost savings, and productivity improvements.
*   **2026-2030 Net Income Margin:** A conservative assumption of only **10 basis points (0.10%)** of margin expansion per year is used post-2025. This reflects sustained, but slow, operational efficiencies and a favorable sales mix shift toward the higher-margin Aftermarket and new technology segments.

#### **ROIC and Cash Flow Calculation:**

*   **Net Income to Cash:** Net Income for each year is assumed to go directly into cash for the following year.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** Given the company is guiding for positive net income and strong cash flow, and the historical data is complicated by the spin-off, a very conservative and reasonable ROIC of **5.0%** is applied to the prior year's retained Net Income (cash) to model additional income generated from reinvestment.

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Operations (B = A * Margin) | Prior Year Retained Cash (C) | ROIC (5.0%) Income (D = C * 5.0%) | Total Net Income (E = B + D) (FCF Proxy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 3,380 | 4.60% | 155 | 0 | 0 | **155** |
| **2026** | 3,461 | 4.70% | 163 | 155 | 8 | **171** |
| **2027** | 3,546 | 4.80% | 170 | 326 | 16 | **186** |
| **2028** | 3,633 | 4.90% | 178 | 512 | 26 | **204** |
| **2029** | 3,725 | 5.00% | 186 | 716 | 36 | **222** |
| **2030** | 3,819 | 5.10% | 195 | 938 | 47 | **242** |

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

#### **DCF Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) proxy, reflecting the risk of a new public company operating in the transitionary automotive component sector, but still profitable with a strong Aftermarket segment.
*   **Terminal Value (Maturity) Rate (Very Conservative):** **2.0%**. This low rate reflects long-term economic inflation and is highly conservative for a company expected to have a growing market for its key segments (Aftermarket, CV, Industrial, New Tech) well into the future.
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the perpetuity growth formula: TV = (FCF 2030 \* (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate).

| Year | Total Net Income (FCF Proxy) (E) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 155 | 0.909 | 141 |
| **2026** | 171 | 0.826 | 141 |
| **2027** | 186 | 0.751 | 140 |
| **2028** | 204 | 0.683 | 139 |
| **2029** | 222 | 0.621 | 138 |
| **2030** | 242 | 0.564 | 137 |

**Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030):**
*   TV = (242 \* (1 + 0.02)) / (0.10 - 0.02) = 246.84 / 0.08 = \$3,085.5 million
*   Discounted TV = 3,085.5 \* Discount Factor (2030) = 3,085.5 \* 0.564 = **\$1,740 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
*   Sum of Discounted FCF (2025-2030) + Discounted Terminal Value
*   NPV = (141 + 141 + 140 + 139 + 138 + 137) + 1,740 = **\$2,576 million**

### **5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification**

#### **Fair Value Calculation:**

| Metric | Value (USD in Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | $2,576 |
| **Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $347 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | ($990) |
| **Equity Value** | **$1,933** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in Millions)** | 38.90 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$49.69** |

#### **Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value (USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$49.69** |
| **Current Market Price** | $54.70 |
| **Difference** | **-8.8%** |

The calculated Fair Value of **$49.69** per share is approximately **8.8% lower** than the current market price of $54.70.

#### **Market Assumptions Justification**

The market is valuing PHINIA Inc. at a slight premium to this conservative DCF model, which suggests the market is making slightly more optimistic assumptions than those used in this analysis.

The market's assumptions are likely factoring in one or both of the following:

1.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate (Optimistic Revenue Engine):** The market may be assuming the company's shift into new, higher-growth areas (Alternative Fuels, Aerospace) will accelerate the growth of the 73% Growth Segment more aggressively than the conservative **3.5%** used here. For instance, a long-term blended growth rate of **3.0% - 3.5%** (instead of the 2.5% used) would quickly bridge the valuation gap.
2.  **Higher Terminal Value/Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be pricing in a lower cost of capital (Discount Rate) or a higher, less conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate). For example, a **9.0%** discount rate (instead of 10.0%) or a **2.5%** maturity rate (instead of 2.0%) would justify the current price, indicating the market views PHIN's cash flows as slightly less risky or its long-term growth as slightly higher than the conservative assumptions used in this DCF.
3.  **Near-Term Margin Expansion:** The market may believe the company will achieve the higher end of the 2025 Net Income guidance ($\$170$ million or 5.0%) and that the post-2025 margin expansion will be quicker than the minimal 10 basis points per year used here, which would drive a higher intrinsic value.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF valuation of \$49.69 is very close to the market price of \$54.70. The small difference is easily explained by the market's reasonable expectation of a marginally higher long-term growth rate or a slightly lower cost of equity/debt than the conservative parameters (10% discount rate, 2% terminal growth, 2.5% revenue CAGR) used in this model. The valuation suggests the stock is currently **fairly valued** based on management's guided metrics and a conservative outlook on its strategic growth initiatives.
