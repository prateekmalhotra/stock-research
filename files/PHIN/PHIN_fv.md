### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection Justification

PHINIA is a provider of fuel systems and aftermarket components, a mature industry focused on optimizing internal combustion engines (ICE) and supporting the large existing fleet through its Aftermarket business. The business engine is driven by:

1.  **Aftermarket Strength:** A robust, high-margin aftermarket segment provides stable, resilient cash flow and is expected to grow. Management is focused on expanding this area.
2.  **Light Vehicle (LV) and Commercial Vehicle (CV) OE Business:** This segment is tied to global LV/CV production cycles and new program wins, which management reports are at "record levels."
3.  **Efficiency and Cost Control:** The company is undergoing significant structural initiatives, including exiting Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) with its former parent (BorgWarner) by the end of 2024 and consolidating ERP systems, which are expected to drive margin expansion and strong cash generation.

**Management Guidance on Growth:**
Management explicitly guided to "average annual **low single digit top line growth through this decade**" (Q4 2023 Earnings Call).

**Revenue Assumptions:**
*   **2024:** Use the guidance midpoint of **$3,500 million**.
*   **2025 - 2030:** A conservative annual revenue growth rate of **2.0%** is applied, which is well within the "low single digit" guidance.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,500 | - | Management Guidance Midpoint |
| **2025** | $3,570 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |
| **2026** | $3,641 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |
| **2027** | $3,714 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |
| **2028** | $3,788 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |
| **2029** | $3,864 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |
| **2030** | $3,941 | 2.0% | Conservative low single-digit growth from guidance |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projection Justification

**Net Margin Assumption:**
*   **2024:** Starting with the implied Net Margin of **4.07%** (midpoint guidance).
*   **Tax Rate:** Management guided for a tax rate of **28% - 32%** in 2024, but explicitly aims to reduce it to "**at or below 20% over the next couple of years**."
*   **Margin Expansion:** Given the successful wind-down of high-cost separation agreements, structural cost controls, and the higher-margin Aftermarket growth, a gradual expansion of the net margin is reasonable. To remain conservative, I will assume a **gradual expansion to 5.0% by 2030**. This is a modest 93 basis point increase over six years.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**
*   The instruction requires calculating a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) on the cumulative retained net income to generate additional income for the next year.
*   **ROIC Proxy:** The 2023 GAAP Net Income was $102M and Total Equity was $1,887M, yielding a Return on Equity (ROE) of 5.41%.
*   **Conservative ROIC:** A conservative, perpetual ROIC of **5.0%** will be used on the accumulated Retained Cash. This reflects a mature, capital-efficient industrial business.

**Net Income Calculation:**
Projected Net Income = (Projected Revenue x Projected Net Margin) + (Prior Year's Retained Cash * ROIC)

| Year | Revenue (M) | Net Margin % | Core Net Income (M) | Retained Cash Start (M) | ROIC Uplift (M) (5.0%) | Total Projected Net Income (M) | Retained Cash End (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,500 | 4.07% | $142.5 | $0 | $0.0 | $142.5 | $142.5 |
| **2025** | $3,570 | 4.20% | $150.0 | $142.5 | $7.1 | $157.1 | $299.6 |
| **2026** | $3,641 | 4.40% | $160.2 | $299.6 | $15.0 | $175.2 | $474.8 |
| **2027** | $3,714 | 4.60% | $170.8 | $474.8 | $23.7 | $194.5 | $669.3 |
| **2028** | $3,788 | 4.80% | $181.8 | $669.3 | $33.5 | $215.3 | $884.6 |
| **2029** | $3,864 | 4.90% | $189.3 | $884.6 | $44.2 | $233.5 | $1,118.1 |
| **2030** | $3,941 | 5.00% | $197.1 | $1,118.1 | $55.9 | $253.0 | $1,371.1 |

*Note: Retained Cash for 2024 is assumed to be 2024 Net Income, as per the instruction. This is a simplification where all Net Income is treated as Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the purpose of the DCF model, which is a conservative approach for a mature, non-growth-chasing business like PHIN.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The DCF will be performed on the projected Net Income (proxy for FCFE) from 2025 to 2030.

**DCF Assumptions:**
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** **10.0%**. This represents a reasonable cost of equity for a publicly traded, stable industrial components supplier.
*   **Conservative Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **1.5%**. This is below the projected 2.0% revenue growth and is a conservative assumption for a mature company in an industry facing long-term ICE transition.

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**
*   Last Projected Cash Flow (2030 Net Income): $253.0 Million
*   Terminal Value = Cash Flow * (1 + g) / (r - g)
*   Terminal Value = $253.0 * (1 + 0.015) / (0.10 - 0.015)
*   Terminal Value = $256.795 / 0.085 = **$3,021.12 Million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) (M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $157.1 | 0.909 | $142.8 |
| **2026** | $175.2 | 0.826 | $144.6 |
| **2027** | $194.5 | 0.751 | $145.9 |
| **2028** | $215.3 | 0.683 | $147.1 |
| **2029** | $233.5 | 0.621 | $145.0 |
| **2030** (Annual) | $253.0 | 0.564 | $142.7 |
| **2030** (Terminal Value) | $3,021.12 | 0.564 | $1,703.9 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | **-** | **-** | **$2,572.0 Million** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Less: Total Debt** | ($796.0) |
| **Equity Value** | **$2,091.0** |
| **Shares Outstanding** (Millions) | 46.16 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$45.30** |

### 6. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: $45.30**

The current market price of PHINIA Inc. (PHIN) is approximately **$39.00** (as of February 5, 2026).

**Justification for Discrepancy (Market Price vs. Fair Value):**

The calculated fair value of **$45.30** is approximately **16% higher** than the current market price of $39.00. This suggests that the market is making a more conservative assumption about PHINIA's future performance than the model.

**Market's More Conservative Assumptions Likely Stem From:**

1.  **The ICE to EV Transition Risk:** PHINIA is an ICE-centric components supplier. While management is focused on the existing fleet (Aftermarket) and new regulations requiring more efficient ICEs (GDI systems), the market likely prices in a more aggressive terminal decline for the OE business than the model's **2.0%** growth and **1.5%** terminal growth rate. The market may assume a growth rate of **0% or even negative growth** over the next decade.
2.  **Uncertainty of Spin-Off Benefits:** Although management projects cost savings and strong cash flow from exiting TSAs and structural efficiencies, the market may be waiting for proof of execution before fully valuing these benefits. The complexity and one-time costs associated with the spin-off (like ERP consolidation) could be seen as a drag.
3.  **High Tax Rate Risk:** The model assumes the tax rate drops to a favorable 20% by 2030, a key part of the margin expansion. If the company fails to achieve this tax reduction target, the net income projections would be lower, pushing the fair value closer to the current market price.

**Why the Model's Assumptions are Justified:**

1.  **Management Guidance as Truth:** The model strictly adheres to the rule to **"use whatever management has said as truth."** Management's guidance of "low single digit top line growth through this decade" and the ability to lower the tax rate to "at or below 20%" underpin the valuation. The **2.0%** revenue growth and **5.0%** terminal net margin (due to the tax rate drop) are direct, yet conservative, interpretations of this guidance.
2.  **Conservative ROIC:** The **5.0% ROIC** is below the historical ROE and is conservative for a firm that is cash-generative with strong Aftermarket sales.
3.  **Conservative Discount Rate:** The **10.0%** discount rate is robust and appropriate for the automotive supplier industry, which is facing long-term structural changes.

The difference between the calculated fair value and the market price can be explained by the market's high degree of caution regarding the long-term viability of an ICE-focused business. The calculated value represents the price if PHINIA successfully executes its stated strategy of low single-digit growth and significant margin/tax-efficiency improvements as a standalone company.
