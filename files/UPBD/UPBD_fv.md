## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Upbound's business engine is a multi-segment model: **Acima** (virtual lease-to-own), **Rent-A-Center** (traditional LTO stores), and **Brigit** (fintech subscription). The forward projections are built on management commentary regarding these segments.

| Segment | 2024 Revenue (Est.) | 2025 Management Guidance / Core Driver | Long-Term Assumption (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acima** | $\approx \$2,236.0$ (52% of $4.3B) | 10.4% YoY Revenue growth in Q3 2025, driven by GMV growth. Focus on credit quality (LCO peak in Q4 2025). | High-single-digit growth (7%-9%) as credit quality is prioritized, leading to slower GMV growth but higher margins. |
| **Rent-A-Center** | $\approx \$1,849.0$ (43% of $4.3B) | Expected low single-digit revenue decline in 2025. | Stabilization to flat (0%) growth after 2025, assuming digital investment and store consolidation offset market maturity. |
| **Brigit** | N/A (Acquired Jan 31, 2025) | $\approx \$222.5$ (Midpoint of $215M - $230M). Driven by 26.8% subscriber growth & 11.4% ARPU growth. | Rapidly decelerating growth from 25% down to 10% by 2030, reflecting new product maturity in the competitive fintech space. |
| **Other (Mexico/Franchising)** | $\approx \$215.0$ (5% of $4.3B) | Not specified. | Stable, low-single-digit growth (3%). |
| **Total 2024 Revenue (Base)** | **$4,300.0** | Full-year 2024 Revenue $\approx \$4.3$ billion. | N/A |

### Revenue Projection Table (USD Millions)

**2025 Total Revenue (Management Midpoint):** Using the Q4 2024 guidance midpoint of $(\$4,500 + \$4,750) / 2 = \$4,625.0$ million.

| Year | Acima Growth Rate | Rent-A-Center Growth Rate | Brigit Growth Rate | Other Growth Rate | Total Revenue (USD MM) |

## 3. Net Income and ROIC Projections (2025-2030)

### Net Income Margin and Tax Rate

*   **2024 GAAP Net Income:** $\approx \$123.76$ million (\$2.21 GAAP Diluted EPS * 56.0M shares).
    *   **2024 Net Margin:** $123.76 / 4,300.0 = **2.88\%**$
*   **2025 Projected Net Income:** Using the latest non-GAAP EPS guidance midpoint of $\$4.10$ and the projected 58.9M average share count.
    *   *Non-GAAP Net Income* = $\$4.10 * 58.9M = \$241.49$ million.
    *   *Note: This non-GAAP figure is a cleaner representation of core profitability than the volatile GAAP figure.* I will use the non-GAAP margin as a base for future projections, assuming the special items diminish.
    *   **2025 Projected Net Margin (Base):** $241.49 / 4,625.0 = **5.22\%**$
*   **Net Margin Assumption (2026-2030):** The company is prioritizing credit quality and margin expansion (Acima aiming for low to mid-teens EBITDA margin). Conservatively, I will assume a slow margin expansion toward 6.0% by 2030, reflecting the high operating leverage of the Acima/Brigit tech platforms and improved underwriting.
*   **Tax Rate:** The company expects a consistent tax rate of $\approx 26\%$. I will use **26.0%** for all projected years.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** To be conservative but reasonable, I will assume an ROIC of **8.0%** on the accumulated cash from previous years' net income.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** Conservative but reasonable at **10.0%**. This reflects the company's non-prime consumer base and financial market risk.
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** A very conservative rate of **1.5%** is used, significantly below the estimated long-term GDP/inflation rate, reflecting the mature/slow-growing nature of the core LTO market.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
Using the Gordon Growth Model with the 2030 Adjusted Net Income (E):

$TV = \frac{Adj. Net Income_{2030} * (1 + g)}{r - g}$

$TV = \frac{\$522.33 * (1 + 0.015)}{0.10 - 0.015} = \frac{\$530.16}{0.085} = **\$6,237.18 \text{ million}**$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Adjusted Net Income (E) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Net Income (USD MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 259.95 | 0.909 | 236.19 |
| **2026** | 306.14 | 0.826 | 252.88 |
| **2027** | 358.77 | 0.751 | 269.41 |
| **2028** | 414.29 | 0.683 | 282.88 |
| **2029** | 467.24 | 0.621 | 290.16 |
| **2030** | 522.33 | 0.564 | 294.97 |
| **Terminal Value** | 6,237.18 | 0.564 | 3,518.27 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$5,144.76** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $5,144.76$ | Sum of NPV of Net Income and Terminal Value |
| **Less: Total Debt (Net)** | $1,546.10$ | From Initial Financial Data |
| **Plus: Excess Cash (YTD)** | $107.00$ | From Initial Financial Data |
| **Equity Value** | **\$3,705.66** | NPV - Debt + Cash |
| **Shares Outstanding (MM)** | $57.91$ | From Initial Financial Data |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$63.99** | Equity Value / Shares Outstanding |

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$63.99** |
| **Current Market Price (Assumed)** | **\$21.43** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated **Fair Value of \$63.99 per share** is approximately **198% higher** than the assumed Current Market Price of \$21.43. This significant discrepancy indicates that the market is making far more pessimistic assumptions about the company's future performance than the model built on management guidance.

**Market's Pessimistic Assumptions (Implicit in \$21.43 Price):**

1.  **Failure to Achieve Margin/Credit Targets:** The market likely assumes that Upbound will **fail to achieve or sustain the projected net margin expansion (5.2% to 6.0%)** due to continued high lease charge-offs (LCO) in the Acima segment, even with management expecting LCOs to peak. The lease-to-own space is highly sensitive to consumer credit health, and the market may be projecting a prolonged economic downturn that crushes the LCO recovery.
2.  **Stagnant or Declining Revenue:** The market may not fully credit the combined growth engine of Acima and Brigit, especially the high-growth fintech revenue. If the market assumes **Acima's growth slows much faster (e.g., 2% per year) and Rent-A-Center continues to decline (e.g., -5% per year)**, the resulting terminal value would be drastically lower.
3.  **Higher Risk / Discount Rate:** The market may be applying a **much higher Discount Rate** to the cash flows (e.g., 14-15%) due to the company's high leverage (long-term net debt target of 1.5x, but currently higher) and the cyclical, subprime nature of its consumer base. A higher discount rate heavily penalizes future growth.
4.  **ROIC/Cash Flow Doubts:** The market may doubt the company's ability to efficiently deploy its excess cash to generate an 8.0% ROIC, potentially seeing it as a low-return operation with significant dividend/buyback commitments that limit true cash reinvestment.

**My Case for the Fair Value:**

The \$63.99 fair value is justified because it is based on:

1.  **Management-Guided Profitability:** The model uses the latest **non-GAAP EPS midpoint for 2025 (\$4.10)**, which provides a much clearer picture of core earnings power than the volatile GAAP figures. This serves as a strong, near-term base.
2.  **Conservative Growth Engine:** The growth rates for Acima (7% to 5% decline) and Brigit (25% to 10% decline) are conservative and rapidly decelerate from their current performance, building in a buffer against execution risk. The core Rent-A-Center business is projected to simply stabilize (0% growth), not grow.
3.  **Very Conservative Terminal Rate:** The **1.5% perpetual growth rate** is a major drag on the valuation, assuming the business essentially matures and grows slower than inflation after 2030, despite the technology focus. If a more reasonable 2.5% rate were used, the valuation would increase significantly.

The market appears to be *over-penalizing* UPBD for its historical cyclicality and past credit issues, and *under-valuing* the improved credit quality focus at Acima and the high-growth potential of the Brigit fintech acquisition. The current price implies a near-zero or even negative perpetual growth rate on the stabilized Net Income, which is overly pessimistic for a diversified omnichannel financial solutions platform.
