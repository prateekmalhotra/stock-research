### 2. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

ATMU's business model is highly resilient, driven primarily by its aftermarket segment, which comprised approximately 86% of net sales in the most recent periods. This creates a stable, recurring revenue base that mitigates the cyclicality of the First-Fit (Original Equipment Manufacturer) segment (14% of revenue). Management explicitly guides on core growth drivers: execution/volume and pricing, while also prioritizing strategic inorganic expansion.

**2025 Revenue Estimate:**
*   Management's 2025 Revenue Guidance: \$1.685 billion to \$1.735 billion.
*   **2025 Estimate:** Midpoint of guidance: **\$1,710.0 million.**

**2026 - 2030 Revenue Engine Assumptions (Conservative Estimates):**

| Segment | 2024 Mix (as of Q2 2025) | Annual Organic Growth Rate Assumption | Rationale (Based on Management Commentary) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aftermarket** | 86% | 3.0% | Aligns with management's stated expectation of *2% growth from execution* plus *1% from pricing* for its core business. |
| **First-Fit (OEM)** | 14% | 1.5% | This market is highly cyclical and is expected to decline double-digits in 2025. A conservative long-term assumption is half the aftermarket growth rate, representing a long-term cyclical average. |
| **Inorganic Growth (M&A)** | N/A | 1.0% | Management cites an "active M&A pipeline" and focus on three new verticals (industrial air, liquids, water). A conservative 1.0% annual increase is built-in to account for successful but moderate execution of this strategy. |

| Metric | 2025 Estimate | 2026 Estimate | 2027 Estimate | 2028 Estimate | 2029 Estimate | 2030 Estimate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starting Revenue (MM)** | **\$1,710.0** | **\$1,780.4** | **\$1,853.5** | **\$1,929.6** | **\$2,008.7** | **\$2,091.0** |
| **Weighted Organic Growth** | N/A | 2.78% | 2.78% | 2.78% | 2.78% | 2.78% |
| **Inorganic Growth** | N/A | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% |
| **Total Revenue Growth** | 2.40% (vs. \$1.670B in 2024) | **3.78%** | **3.78%** | **3.78%** | **3.78%** | **3.78%** |
| **Revenue (MM USD)** | **\$1,710.0** | **\$1,780.4** | **\$1,853.5** | **\$1,929.6** | **\$2,008.7** | **\$2,091.0** |

### 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection (2025-2030)

#### Margin and Tax Assumptions:

*   **Net Income Margin:**
    *   **2024 Net Income (GAAP):** \$186 million on \$1,670 million revenue, implying an **11.14%** Net Income Margin.
    *   **2025 Management Guidance Implied Margin:** The midpoint of Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is 19.625%. Given management's focus on "price-cost neutrality" and margin stability, the valuation will conservatively use the 2024 GAAP margin as a floor and slowly accrete to a slightly higher stable margin that reflects the higher **19.7%** Adjusted EBITDA margin delivered in 2024. A conservative steady-state Net Income Margin of **11.5%** is used for 2026-2030.
*   **Tax Rate:** Effective tax rate was 21.0% in 2024. A steady-state tax rate of **22.0%** is used, slightly higher than historicals for conservatism.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Historical ROIC is reported to be very high (e.g., 33.8% LTM). A highly conservative but reasonable positive rate of **15.0%** is assumed, well below historical performance, to reflect capital reinvestment and conservative valuation.

#### Net Income & Cash Flow Table:

| Metric (MM USD) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | \$1,710.0 | \$1,780.4 | \$1,853.5 | \$1,929.6 | \$2,008.7 | \$2,091.0 |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 11.20% | 11.30% | 11.40% | 11.50% | 11.50% | 11.50% |
| **Net Income from Operations (A)** | **\$191.5** | **\$201.2** | **\$211.3** | **\$221.9** | **\$231.0** | **\$240.5** |
| **Accumulated Cash from Prior Year (B)** | \$0.0 | \$191.5 | \$392.7 | \$604.0 | \$825.9 | \$1,056.9 |
| **ROIC (15.0%) on Prior Cash (C)** | \$0.0 | \$28.7 | \$58.9 | \$90.6 | \$123.9 | \$158.5 |
| **Total Cash Flow (A + C)** | **\$191.5** | **\$229.9** | **\$270.2** | **\$312.5** | **\$354.9** | **\$399.0** |
| *Accumulated Cash (B + A + C)* | *\$191.5* | *\$392.7* | *\$604.0* | *\$825.9* | *\$1,056.9* | *\$1,455.9* |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### Rate Assumptions:

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **9.50%**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a reasonable discount rate for a stable, high-margin, and highly cash-generative industrial company with a large aftermarket business. It is conservative and above typical WACC estimates for resilient industries.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **3.0%**
    *   *Rationale:* This rate is below the assumed nominal GDP growth and accounts for a conservative long-term growth rate for the filtration industry, justified by the steady aftermarket business and management's focus on accretive M&A.

#### Calculation of Net Present Value (NPV):

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (MM USD) | Discount Factor (9.50%) | Net Present Value (MM USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$191.5 | 0.9132 | \$174.8 |
| **2026** | \$229.9 | 0.8340 | \$191.7 |
| **2027** | \$270.2 | 0.7616 | \$205.8 |
| **2028** | \$312.5 | 0.6955 | \$217.3 |
| **2029** | \$354.9 | 0.6351 | \$225.4 |
| **2030** | \$399.0 | 0.5799 | \$231.4 |
| **Sum of NPV of Projected Flows** | | | **\$1,246.4** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation:

*   **2030 Terminal Cash Flow:** \$399.0 million
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** (Cash Flow 2030 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   (\$399.0 \* (1 + 0.03)) / (0.095 - 0.03) = **\$6,290.46 million**
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (2030):** Terminal Value \* Discount Factor (2030)
    *   \$6,290.46 \* 0.5799 = **\$3,648.8 million**

#### Total Equity Value:

| Metric (MM USD) | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of NPV of Projected Flows (2025-2030) | \$1,246.4 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | \$3,648.8 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **\$4,895.2** |
| Subtract: Total Debt (Jun 30, 2025) | (\$585.0) |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (Jun 30, 2025) | \$190.8 |
| **Fair Equity Value** | **\$4,501.0** |

### 5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fair Equity Value (MM USD) | \$4,501.0 million |
| Shares Outstanding (MM) | 82.15 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$54.79** |

### Fair Value and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. (ATMU) is **\$54.79**.

The current stock price is approximately **\$44.00**.

**Valuation Conclusion and Justification:**

The calculated fair value of **\$54.79** is approximately **24.5% higher** than the current market price of \$44.00. This suggests that, based on a conservative DCF model using management's stated business engine and guidance, the stock is currently **undervalued** by the market.

**Justification for the Difference:**

The difference between the calculated intrinsic value and the market price lies in the conservative yet specific assumptions about ATMU's **business engine and cash conversion:**

1.  **Market Over-Weighting First-Fit Cyclicality:** The market may be overly focused on the current economic weakness and the "double-digit declines" expected in the First-Fit market for 2025. The model mitigates this fear by weighting the stable Aftermarket business (86% of revenue) significantly higher and assuming only a moderate, mid-cycle growth rate for First-Fit. The market might be discounting the entire company based on the cyclical 14% segment.
2.  **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** The model used a highly conservative 15.0% ROIC, well below the reported LTM ROIC of 33.8% and 5-year average of 35.3%. A business model with such high cash conversion and superior returns on invested capital typically generates massive shareholder value. If the model had used a more representative 20.0% ROIC, the fair value would be significantly higher. The conservative 15.0% still produces a premium to the current price, indicating the company's core profitability is significantly under-appreciated.
3.  **Low Terminal Growth Rate:** The 3.0% Terminal Growth Rate is conservative, especially for a company with a stated focus on accretive M&A in new verticals (industrial air, liquids, water). The market is likely not giving full credit to the value-creation potential from the inorganic growth pipeline. The intrinsic value suggests that even modest success on the M&A front, coupled with stable aftermarket growth, warrants a higher price.

**In summary, the market appears to be underestimating the resilience, cash-generating power, and efficient capital allocation (high ROIC) inherent in ATMU's high-margin, aftermarket-dominant business model, leading to a disconnect with the calculated intrinsic value.**
