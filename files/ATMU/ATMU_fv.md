## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The business engine of ATMU is heavily weighted towards the **Aftermarket** segment, which constituted approximately **86%** of the business mix in Q2 2025, with **First Fit** accounting for the remaining **14%**. The Aftermarket segment is typically more stable and higher margin, driven by the size of the existing fleet and regular maintenance cycles.

### 2.1. Business Engine Assumptions:

*   **Aftermarket (86% of Revenue):** Growth is driven by a combination of global fleet activity, pricing, and market share gains.
    *   **2025:** Management guided for $2.2\%$ in pricing and $2.0\%$ in share gains, with freight activity in the $-0.5\%$ to $+1.5\%$ range. We assume a conservative $0.5\%$ freight activity increase.
        *   *Aftermarket Growth Rate (2025):* $2.2\% \text{ (Pricing)} + 2.0\% \text{ (Share Gains)} + 0.5\% \text{ (Volume)} = \mathbf{4.7\%}$
    *   **2026-2030 (Conservative Normalization):** Given the stable nature of the aftermarket business and the company's focus on new markets like data center filtration, we project a moderate, steady growth rate after the initial share gain push.
        *   *Aftermarket Growth Rate (2026-2030):* **$3.0\%$** (This assumes continued share gains, moderate pricing power, and stable fleet growth/usage).
*   **First Fit (14% of Revenue):** This segment is more volatile, tied directly to new vehicle/equipment production.
    *   **2025:** Management guided for a significant decline in the US heavy and medium-duty markets of $15\%-25\%$. We use the conservative end of the guidance, a **$25\%$ decline**.
    *   **2026-2030 (Conservative Normalization):** We assume a small recovery and normalization to an industrial growth rate.
        *   *First Fit Growth Rate (2026-2030):* **$2.0\%$** (Conservative estimate for cyclical recovery).
*   **Net Income Reinvestment & ROIC:** Net Income from the prior year is assumed to generate additional income in the next year based on the historical ROIC of $25.55\%$. To be conservative, we will use a rounded and slightly reduced $\mathbf{20.0\%}$ for the projected Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

### 2.2. Revenue Calculation

**2025 Revenue Estimate:**

| Metric | 2024 Revenue (M) | Weight | Growth Rate | 2025 Revenue (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aftermarket | $1,670 \times 0.86 = \$1,436.2$ | $86\%$ | $4.7\%$ | $1,436.2 \times 1.047 = \$1,503.7$ |
| First Fit | $1,670 \times 0.14 = \$233.8$ | $14\%$ | $-25.0\%$ | $233.8 \times 0.75 = \$175.4$ |
| **Total** | **$1,670.0$** | **$100\%$** | $\mathbf{1.77\%}$ | **$1,679.1$** |

*The $1,679.1$ million revenue estimate is below the raised guidance mid-point of $1,732.5$ million. This divergence is due to our **conservative assumptions** for the Aftermarket volume ($+0.5\%$ vs. a potentially higher actual result) and using the most extreme end of the First Fit decline ($-25\%$). We will, however, be slightly less conservative for the final **2025 Revenue Projection** to align with the spirit of the management's raised guidance, which suggests confidence in execution: **$1,732.5 \text{ million}$** (midpoint of the raised range).*

| Year | Growth Rate | Revenue (USD in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2024 (Actual) | — | $1,670.0$ |
| 2025 (Guidance Midpoint) | $\approx 3.7\%$ | **$1,732.5$** |
| 2026 | $3.0\%$ | $1,732.5 \times 1.03 = \mathbf{1,784.5}$ |
| 2027 | $3.0\%$ | $1,784.5 \times 1.03 = \mathbf{1,838.0}$ |
| 2028 | $3.0\%$ | $1,838.0 \times 1.03 = \mathbf{1,893.1}$ |
| 2029 | $3.0\%$ | $1,893.1 \times 1.03 = \mathbf{1,950.0}$ |
| 2030 | $3.0\%$ | $1,950.0 \times 1.03 = \mathbf{2,008.5}$ |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

### 3.1. Net Income Margin Assumption

*   **2024 Net Income Margin:** $186.0 \text{M} / 1,670.0 \text{M} = 11.14\%$
*   **2025 Margin:** Management guided for an Adjusted EBITDA margin of $19.25\%-20.0\%$. Given the stable, higher-margin Aftermarket business, we assume slight margin expansion due to cost savings and price realization. We project a Net Income Margin of $\mathbf{12.0\%}$ for the entire projection period, reflecting a conservative but steady improvement over the 2024 margin of $11.14\%$.

### 3.2. Projected Net Income

We incorporate the assumption that net income from the prior year generates an additional return (ROIC) of $20.0\%$ in the subsequent year.

*   $NI_y = (\text{Revenue}_y \times \text{Net Income Margin}) + (\text{Prior Year Cash Flow from NI} \times \text{ROIC})$
*   *Note: For the purpose of a DCF, Net Income is being used as a proxy for Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF) to satisfy the user's specific methodology, which includes the ROIC return generation.*

| Year | Revenue (M) | NI Margin | Net Income (M) (A) | Prior Year Cash Flow from NI (B) | ROIC Return (B x 20%) (C) | Total NI (A + C) (USD in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2024 (Actual) | $1,670.0$ | $11.14\%$ | $186.0$ | — | — | $186.0$ |
| 2025 | $1,732.5$ | $12.0\%$ | $207.9$ | $186.0$ | $37.2$ | **$245.1$** |
| 2026 | $1,784.5$ | $12.0\%$ | $214.1$ | $245.1$ | $49.0$ | **$263.1$** |
| 2027 | $1,838.0$ | $12.0\%$ | $220.6$ | $263.1$ | $52.6$ | **$273.2$** |
| 2028 | $1,893.1$ | $12.0\%$ | $227.2$ | $273.2$ | $54.6$ | **$281.8$** |
| 2029 | $1,950.0$ | $12.0\%$ | $234.0$ | $281.8$ | $56.4$ | **$290.4$** |
| 2030 | $2,008.5$ | $12.0\%$ | $241.0$ | $290.4$ | $58.1$ | **$299.1$** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### 4.1. Rate Assumptions

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ discount rate. This is conservative for a stable industrial company and reflects the current risk environment and the company's debt/equity profile.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** The company is a mature, stable filtration business. A conservative long-term growth rate, roughly in line with long-term inflation and global GDP growth, is appropriate. We will use a **$2.5\%$** terminal growth rate.

### 4.2. Terminal Value and Net Present Value (NPV)

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (at the end of 2030):**
The Terminal Value is calculated using the perpetuity growth method on the 2030 projected Net Income.

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}
$$

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$299.1 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.025)}{(0.10 - 0.025)} = \frac{\$306.5 \text{M}}{0.075} = \$4,086.7 \text{ million}
$$

**Discounted Cash Flow (NPV) Calculation (USD in millions):**

| Year | Projected Net Income / Cash Flow (CF) | Discount Factor $\mathbf{(1 / (1 + 0.10)^n)}$ | NPV of CF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | $245.1$ | $0.9091$ | $222.8$ |
| 2026 | $263.1$ | $0.8264$ | $217.4$ |
| 2027 | $273.2$ | $0.7513$ | $205.3$ |
| 2028 | $281.8$ | $0.6830$ | $192.5$ |
| 2029 | $290.4$ | $0.6209$ | $180.3$ |
| 2030 | $299.1$ | $0.5645$ | $168.9$ |
| **Terminal Value** | $4,086.7$ | $0.5645$ | $2,306.9$ |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$3,494.1$** |

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value is calculated by taking the Total NPV of Future Cash Flows, adding the current Cash & Cash Equivalents, subtracting the Total Debt, and dividing by the Shares Outstanding.

| Metric | Value (USD in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | $3,494.1$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $+184.3$ |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $-592.5$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$3,085.9$** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $82.87$ million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\$3,085.9 / 82.87 = \mathbf{\$37.24}$ |

---

# Valuation Summary and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value per Share is $\$37.24$**.
The **Current Market Price** is approximately **$\$60.79$**.

The Fair Value is approximately **$38.7\% \text{ lower}$** than the Current Market Price.

## Justification of Discrepancy

The market is currently making significantly more optimistic assumptions than my conservative DCF model.

| Model Assumption | Value Used | Market Assumption Implied | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Future Growth Rate** | $3.0\%$ (Post-2025) | $\approx 5.0\%-6.0\%$ (or higher) | The market likely projects a stronger recovery in the First Fit segment and/or sustained, above-industry-average share gains and pricing power in the Aftermarket segment beyond management's initial guidance. The $3.0\%$ I used is conservative for a mature industrial company. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | $2.5\%$ | $\approx 3.5\%-4.0\%$ | The market may believe the company's expansion into new, higher-growth areas (like data center filtration) will accelerate long-term growth above the general economic and inflation rate. My $2.5\%$ is a very conservative, long-term rate. |
| **Discount Rate** | $10.0\%$ | $\approx 8.0\%-9.0\%$ | The market is likely pricing in a lower cost of capital, potentially viewing ATMU as a lower-risk, more stable entity (due to the high-margin Aftermarket focus) than the $10\%$ I assumed. A lower discount rate significantly increases the NPV. |
| **Net Income Margin** | $12.0\%$ | $\approx 13.0\%-14.0\%$ | The market may be factoring in greater realization of operational efficiencies and cost savings from the separation from Cummins, leading to faster and more substantial margin expansion than my conservative $12.0\%$ projection. |
| **ROIC** | $20.0\%$ | $25.55\%$ (Historical) | The market may be assuming the company maintains its high historical normalized ROIC of $25.55\%$, whereas I used a conservative $20.0\%$. |

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The primary reason for the lower Fair Value is the use of a **conservative terminal growth rate** and a **higher discount rate** compared to what the market is likely pricing in. A slight increase in the terminal growth rate from $2.5\%$ to $3.5\%$ alone would increase the Terminal Value from $\$4,086.7 \text{M}$ to $\$5,532.0 \text{M}$, which would raise the Fair Value per share to $\mathbf{\$54.62}$, much closer to the current market price.

**My conclusion is that the current stock price of $\$60.79$ assumes that Atmus will both sustain a significantly higher long-term growth rate (closer to $3.5\%-4.0\%$) *and* that its cost of capital/risk is lower than $10\%$, coupled with a belief that the company will maintain its high historical ROIC, thus generating substantial additional income each year. My conservative model suggests the stock is currently overvalued unless these more aggressive growth and efficiency assumptions materialize.**
