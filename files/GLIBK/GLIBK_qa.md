## Business Summary

GCI Liberty primarily operated as a holding company with two main parts: a traditional telecommunications provider and a strategic investment portfolio. The operating business, GCI Communications, provided essential services like high-speed internet, cable television, and mobile phone service across Alaska. Its customers were Alaskan families, government offices, and local businesses who rely heavily on connectivity due to the state's remote nature. Operating revenue was largely generated from the monthly subscription fees paid by these Alaskan customers for their connectivity services. Separately, the company functioned as an investment group, holding significant stakes in other large communications entities, most notably Liberty Broadband, generating value from the success and stock performance of these investments.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk is the high cost of maintaining and upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure in Alaska. The extreme weather and difficult terrain make network expansions (such as 5G and fiber optic rollouts) highly expensive, which can reduce profitability and increase the debt needed for modernization. In the past, companies in this region have struggled with the massive capital required to transition from old copper lines to modern fiber and wireless networks. A long-term risk stems from the company's dual structure: a large portion of its market value depends entirely on the stock performance of its strategic investment holdings. If key investments, such as Liberty Broadband, face competitive pressure or regulatory setbacks, the value of GCI Liberty would drop significantly, regardless of how well the Alaskan operations perform. Furthermore, competition from emerging satellite internet providers poses a long-term threat to the Alaskan market share, potentially eroding the core subscription revenue base.

## Company History

This is the history of GCI Liberty, Inc. (GLIBK), tracing its roots in Alaska to its current status as an independent public company.

### Inception and Core Mission (1979 - 2017)

1.  **Original Founding and Purpose:** The company's operating business, General Communication, Inc. (GCI), was founded in 1979 in Anchorage, Alaska, by Ron Duncan and Bob Walp.
2.  **The Founding Goal (Problem to Solve):** GCI was founded as a competitive long-distance phone provider to fight the high cost of communication in Alaska, where long-distance calls could cost up to \$1 per minute.
3.  **Early Innovative Solution:** The company pioneered the use of DAMA satellite communication technology, which helped introduce competitive local and long-distance phone service, dramatically lowering costs for Alaskans.
4.  **Growth and Expansion:** GCI consistently expanded its services over the next few decades, moving into cable television, internet access, and wireless services. This included the construction of a major undersea fiber optic cable system linking Alaska to the contiguous United States.

### The Formation of GCI Liberty (2017 - 2020)

5.  **Corporate Restructuring:** The "GCI Liberty, Inc." entity itself was officially created in 2017/2018 through a complex reorganization involving General Communication, Inc. and Liberty Interactive Corporation.
6.  **New Structure:** The newly created GCI Liberty, Inc. became a publicly traded holding company that owned the Alaskan communications business (GCI) along with other valuable assets, notably an equity stake in major cable company Charter Communications and an interest in Liberty Broadband.
7.  **Brief Acquisition:** In late 2020, GCI Liberty, Inc. was acquired and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Broadband Corporation.

### Challenges (Headwinds)

8.  **The Geographic Headwind:** GCI's most significant and ongoing challenge is Alaska’s harsh weather, remote locations, and vast distances; this makes building, operating, and maintaining communication networks extremely expensive and difficult.
9.  **Historical Network Problem:** For many years, the company's wireless network was a "patchwork quilt" of various technologies acquired over time, which created technical debt and operational challenges, leading to customer losses in the mid-2010s.
10. **The Funding Headwind:** Due to the extremely high cost of operation in Alaska, the GCI business has historically relied heavily on federal subsidies, particularly the Universal Service Fund (USF), which introduces regulatory risk and funding uncertainty.

### Innovative Solutions and Advantages (Tailwinds)

11. **Infrastructure Focus:** The company’s consistent investment of over \$4.7 billion across 45 years to build a statewide network of fiber optic, microwave, and satellite technology is a major advantage (or "moat") in the challenging Alaskan market.
12. **Innovative Network Modernization:** Facing customer losses, GCI implemented a total business transformation, launching Alaska's first statewide 5G network in 2020 in partnership with Ericsson, which reversed customer losses and led to continuous growth.
13. **Closing the Digital Divide (The Mission):** GCI made its core goal the commitment to bring urban-level broadband speed and pricing to rural Alaskan communities, often in partnership with local and Native corporations. This includes massive projects like the AU-Aleutians Fiber Project and the AIRRAQ Network.
14. **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The federal government's increasing push for universal broadband access and programs like the FCC's "Alaska Plan" have provided significant, dedicated funding for GCI to build out its rural network infrastructure. The recent Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of the key Universal Service Fund (USF) provided crucial financial clarity.

### Present Date (Post-2024 Spin-Off)

15. **The Spin-Off (Present Day):** On July 14, 2025, GCI Liberty, Inc. completed a spin-off from Liberty Broadband Corporation to become an independent, separate publicly traded company once again (GLIBK is the ticker for its Class C shares).
16. **Why the Spin-Off:** This was a strategic move requested by Charter Communications, which was acquiring Liberty Broadband but did not want to operate the geographically challenging GCI business in Alaska.
17. **Current Goal/Outlook:** As a newly independent company, GCI Liberty, Inc.'s primary focus is solely on the GCI operating business in Alaska. Its goal is to continue leveraging federal and state programs to aggressively complete its network expansion and capitalize on the demand for advanced connectivity services in a unique, yet highly strategic, regional market.

## Moat Analysis

The analysis of GCI Liberty, Inc. (GLIBK), primarily through its operating subsidiary GCI, shows a strong economic moat built on an irreplaceable physical asset in an extremely challenging geographic market.

### Moat Analysis of GCI Liberty (GLIBK)

#### **What Makes it Different from Competitors?**

1.  **Immovable First-Mover Advantage in Infrastructure:** GCI was founded in 1979 and has spent over 40 years investing billions of dollars—specifically, over **$4.7 billion**—to build a vast, state-wide network and fiber-optic cable systems throughout Alaska. This investment gives it control of the primary communications infrastructure in a state with immense geography, rugged terrain, and limited transportation.
2.  **High Barrier to Entry due to Unique Geography:** The cost and difficulty of replicating this extensive network in a low-population-density, high-cost environment like Alaska is a significant deterrent to new entrants, establishing a nearly insurmountable barrier for typical competitors.
3.  **Local Expertise and Operational Know-How:** Decades of operation in Alaska have given the company unique local expertise in infrastructure construction and maintenance, which is essential for running a network in harsh winter weather and remote geographies.

#### **Special Pricing Power and Market Position**

4.  **Special Position with Government Support:** A unique advantage is its reliance on federal support through the **Universal Service Fund (USF)** programs, including those for high-cost areas, rural health care, and schools. This support has historically represented a substantial portion of the company's revenue, providing a stable, regulated income stream that many competitors lack.
5.  **Incumbent in a Low-Competition Market:** GCI is the established, mature incumbent in its core market, which results in low market share shifts over time and a relatively low-competition environment. This dominant position allows for stable margins.

#### **Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk**

6.  **Reason for Growth is Persistent Investment:** The company grew into what it is today by continuously and significantly expanding its network and product offerings since 1979, including laying essential undersea fiber optic cables linking Alaska to the rest of the US. This decades-long focus on building the physical backbone of communications in Alaska is the foundation of its market dominance.
7.  **High Capital Requirement Deters Displacement:** Displacement by a company with more capital is difficult because the barrier is not just financial, but also logistical and time-based. The massive network has taken over four decades to build; a competitor would need to spend billions and overcome the complex, high-cost geographic challenges to lay a competing wired network.
8.  **Competition from Satellite Technology:** The primary threat comes from new, capital-light technologies like low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet (e.g., Starlink). While LEO services are capturing some market share, GCI’s core, high-capacity wired infrastructure and business/government contracts are still hard to displace with satellite technology.

#### **Customer Stickiness and Contract Structure**

9.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Base:** Telecommunications services, such as data, mobile, and voice, are generally **recurring** revenue.
10. **High Switching Costs and Essential Services:** Customers, particularly in remote areas, rely extensively on GCI's systems for communication, public safety, and other needs, which creates high switching costs and makes them very sticky. The company also serves sticky, high-margin customers like government, healthcare, and education with long-term data service contracts.

#### **Actions to Ensure a Solid Moat**

11. **Focus on Infrastructure Upgrades (R&D Substitute):** While not a traditional software R&D company, GCI constantly invests in network innovation and upgrades to maintain its edge. Examples include launching Alaska's first 5G network and the ongoing rollout of the latest cable technology (DOCSIS 4.0).
12. **Continuing Network Expansion:** The company is actively continuing to build out its network in key rural markets, partly with the support of government grants, which strengthens its geographic moat and extends its dominance in underserved areas.

## Management Incentive

Based on the last available public filings, specifically the 2021 Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) covering the period before the merger with Liberty Broadband Corporation, here is an analysis of GCI Liberty, Inc.'s (GLIBK) management incentive and compensation structure:

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (GCI Liberty, Inc.)

1.  **Insider Ownership (Managers & Directors):**
    *   The overall reported Insider Ownership for a class of common stock (GLIBA) was approximately **9.11%** of the outstanding shares, which is a moderate level for a large public company.
    *   A critical factor was the significant influence of Chairman **John C. Malone**, who was expected to beneficially own a substantial percentage of the voting power, suggesting a strong "owner-operator" mindset at the highest level of the company's control structure.

2.  **Compensation Philosophy and Structure:**
    *   The Compensation Committee stated that its programs were explicitly designed to align executive compensation with **Company performance and shareholder returns**.
    *   Executive pay emphasized an incentive-based approach, with a significant portion of compensation delivered through **long-term equity awards**, specifically Performance-Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs), which are linked to shareholder value creation.

3.  **Long-Term Incentives and Metrics:**
    *   Long-term incentive compensation was primarily comprised of equity awards linked to the Company's stock price, directly aligning executive interests with the appreciation of shareholder value over a multi-year vesting period.
    *   The long-term incentive plan used **balanced performance metrics** that focused on both profitable earnings growth and strategic capital deployment, rather than solely short-term results.

4.  **Financial Performance Metrics:**
    *   A key financial measure used for the core GCI operating segment was **Adjusted OIBDA (Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization)**, which management believed was an important indicator of operational strength and ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures.
    *   The reliance on both high-level financial metrics and equity-based compensation tied to stock price indicates a dual focus on operational execution and market capitalization growth.

5.  **Shareholder Alignment Policies:**
    *   The company maintained **robust minimum stock ownership guidelines** for executives, reinforcing the expectation that they should hold a substantial personal financial stake in the company's performance.
    *   A requirement for executives to retain **50% of the net after-tax shares** from equity awards until their ownership guidelines were met ensured that management could not immediately liquidate all incentive gains, promoting a long-term perspective.
    *   A **claw-back policy** was maintained, allowing the company to recover incentive-based compensation in the event of restatements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive

The management of GCI Liberty, Inc. appears to have had **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

The key factors supporting this conclusion are:
*   **Strong Alignment with Shareholder Value:** The compensation structure heavily favored **long-term, stock-based awards (PRSUs)** and was directly linked to **shareholder return** and growth, ensuring management profited only if shareholders did.
*   **Owner-Operator Structure:** While the absolute insider ownership percentage was moderate, the company's control structure under figures like John Malone historically signifies an emphasis on long-term capital appreciation and strategic value creation.
*   **Best Practices in Governance:** The presence of **minimum stock ownership guidelines, a retention policy for equity gains, and a claw-back policy** demonstrates a commitment to governance practices designed to prevent short-term manipulation and encourage sustained performance.

## Long Thesis

GCI Liberty (GLIBK) is the dominant owner of the essential, high-speed communications network in Alaska, a region where the cost and difficulty of building a competing network is prohibitively high. This creates a powerful, nearly insurmountable advantage and ensures stable, recurring revenue from essential services (internet and mobile). In the near term, experienced management is focused on efficiency, aiming for record profitability in 2025 by exiting low-growth businesses and focusing entirely on high-margin connectivity. Long term, the company will use hundreds of millions in federal grants to expand its advanced network into remote, previously unserved Alaskan markets. This growth, combined with ongoing network upgrades (like 5G and fiber) that lower future maintenance costs, guarantees market expansion and significant long-term growth in cash flow, which will unlock higher stock value.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that management successfully executes its highly complex, multi-year plan to build out the network in rural Alaska using federal grants by the 2026 deadline. We assume that federal financial support for operating in high-cost areas remains reliable, providing a necessary, stable income floor. Crucially, the company must maintain its dominant market position, meaning new competitors, especially low-earth orbit satellite internet providers (like Starlink), cannot steal significant market share from GCI’s core wired infrastructure or its high-margin government and business contracts.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for GCI Liberty, Inc. (GLIBK) is flawed as it significantly underestimates immediate competitive threats, oversimplifies regulatory and execution risks, and relies on future profitability projections that contradict recent financial performance indicators.

Here are the holes and faults in the thesis:

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **The Dominant Market Position is Rapidly Eroding from LEO Satellites (Starlink).** The core assumption that Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites *cannot* steal significant market share is false; LEO providers offer cheaper, faster service in GCI's most vulnerable and previously high-margin rural markets, and GCI has noted a "significant change in usership" and subscriber cancellations.
2.  **The "Prohibitively High" Barrier to Entry Has Been Bypassed.** The thesis's defense of GCI's "nearly insurmountable advantage" based on terrestrial build-out costs is irrelevant, as LEO satellites provide a wireless, high-speed alternative that bypasses the need for GCI's expensive fiber and microwave infrastructure in remote Alaskan areas.
3.  **Management's Near-Term Profitability Claims are Contradicted by Financial Results.** The goal of "record profitability in 2025" is undermined by the Q3 2025 report showing an **8% decline in Adjusted OIBDA** and a steep operating loss of **$488 million** due to a large non-cash impairment charge on intangible assets, suggesting a significant write-down of asset value.
4.  **The "Stable, Recurring Revenue" from Federal Support is Under Existential Threat.** The reliance on reliable federal support is highly precarious, as the entire framework of the Universal Service Fund (USF)—which subsidizes GCI's high-cost operations—is facing a pending Supreme Court challenge that could interrupt funding flows and is deemed an "existential threat" to rural Alaskan telecom services.
5.  **The Expansion Plan is Burdened by High Execution and Capital Risk.** The multi-year plan involves significant **capital expenditures of $225-$250 million in 2025, with peak spending expected in 2026**, which must be successfully executed in Alaska's extreme weather and complex logistical environment to meet the grant deadlines.
6.  **Focus on "High-Margin" Connectivity is Being Cannibalized.** GCI's recognition of the LEO threat has led it to enter an enterprise reseller agreement with Starlink for its high-margin business and government customers, which confirms that GCI's network is not competitive in all areas and will likely cannibalize its own revenue in favor of retaining the customer relationship.
7.  **Dilution Risk to Finance Growth.** The need for "hundreds of millions" in funding is evidenced by the announced **$300 million rights offering** to stockholders, which indicates the internal free cash flow is insufficient for the necessary capital expenditures, introducing the risk of shareholder dilution to finance the network defense and build-out.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for GCI Liberty, Inc. (GLIBK)**

1.  **Legacy Asset Impairment and Cash Flow Strain:** GCI's operating model is fundamentally challenged by LEO satellite competition, forcing the company to record massive asset impairments and causing a decline in data subscribers and core profitability (Adjusted OIBDA), which will strain the company's free cash flow and require the issuance of new equity (rights offering) to cover aggressive future capital expenditures.
2.  **Existential Regulatory/Subsidy Risk:** The company's primary defense against competition in rural areas—stable federal funding from the Universal Service Fund (USF)—is facing a high-risk Supreme Court challenge that could eliminate the financial floor underpinning its high-cost network, leaving GCI exposed to a non-subsidized, lower-cost competitor.
3.  **Network Cannibalization and Value Destruction:** In a defensive move, GCI is becoming a reseller of its direct competitor (Starlink) in the high-margin business/government segment in remote regions, which validates the technological superiority of LEOs and effectively cannibalizes GCI's existing microwave assets, destroying the value of the very network the long thesis celebrates.
4.  **High-Risk, High-CapEx Execution:** The multi-year grant-funded fiber build-out into remote Alaska represents a massive, high-risk capital undertaking with peak spending expected in 2026; the failure to meet deadlines, inevitable cost overruns due to extreme conditions, or delays from changing federal grant requirements (like the BEAD program) will further depress returns and delay any anticipated long-term cash flow benefit.

---

## Next Steps

The extensive analysis and the initial search have addressed some high-priority questions, specifically the **USF Supreme Court case** and the **Rights Offering terms**.

### **Search Result Takeaways:**

1.  **USF Regulatory Risk is Greatly Reduced:** The Supreme Court (in *FCC v. Consumers' Research*) ruled on June 27, 2025, to uphold the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund (USF) funding mechanism, reversing the Fifth Circuit. This largely removes the "existential regulatory risk" cited in the bear case.
2.  **Rights Offering Details are Concrete:** The $\$300$ million rights offering commenced on November 26, 2025 (today) and is expected to expire on December 17, 2025. The subscription price is a confirmed **\$27.20** per share, representing a 20% discount to a prior 10-day volume-weighted average price.
3.  **Financial Health Context:** Trailing twelve-month (TTM) Free Cash Flow (FCF) as of Q2 2025 was **\$153 million**, while the full-year 2025 CapEx is expected to be around **\$250 million**. This confirms that CapEx significantly outstrips FCF, necessitating external funding (like the rights offering).
4.  **Starlink Agreement is for Business/Government:** The Starlink reseller agreement is for GCI's *Business* customers (healthcare, education, and enterprise) and is framed as a strategic move to complete their connectivity toolkit in the hardest-to-reach areas.
5.  **Subscriber Loss Data is Limited/Mixed:** Q3 2025 saw a drop of 1,400 broadband subscribers, and consumer cable modem subscribers declined 3% in Q2 2025. However, consumer wireless lines grew 1%. There is no precise number directly linking these losses to Starlink *specifically* in the search results.

***

### **Next Steps to Investigate (Unanswered Critical Questions)**

1.  **Quantify Starlink's Direct Financial Impact (Competitive Erosion):**
    *   The bear case is heavily reliant on Starlink. Search for specific management commentary from the Q3 2025 earnings call or analyst reports that precisely quantifies the degree to which Starlink is causing subscriber/ARPU churn, especially in the high-cost rural (HCF) markets.

2.  **Model True Dilution and Post-Rights Offering Valuation:**
    *   Use the subscription price of **\$27.20** and the intended raise of **\$300 million** to calculate the approximate number of new shares to be issued. Then, determine the post-offering fully diluted share count to accurately assess the stock's valuation metrics (P/E, EV/EBITDA) and the impact on Book Value.

3.  **Future Free Cash Flow (FCF) Modeling and Sustainability:**
    *   Since CapEx is expected to peak in 2026 before declining to a "more normalized level" in 2027, investigate the projected *normalized* maintenance CapEx and expected FCF for 2027 onwards. This is crucial for valuing the long-term cash flow stream of the core business.

4.  **Business Reseller Margin and Cannibalization Risk:**
    *   The GCI-Starlink deal is for the **Business** segment, which has a *higher margin* and is growing well (14% revenue increase in Q2 2025). Analyze whether reselling Starlink services will result in lower, more commoditized margins compared to GCI's traditional B2B service, thus cannibalizing its most valuable growth segment.

5.  **Status and Risk of Federal Grant Execution (The Tailwinds):**
    *   The $\$140$ million in federal grant awards (e.g., Alaska Plan) has an execution deadline of late 2026. Investigate the current status of construction milestones and whether there are any reported supply chain, labor, or weather-related delays that could put the grants at risk of clawback or reduce future funding availability.

6.  **Valuation of Embedded Tax Assets:**
    *   Management has mentioned a potential $\$1$ billion tax asset. Investigate the exact nature and timing of the use of these Net Operating Losses (NOLs) or other tax benefits. A large tax shield would significantly boost future after-tax Free Cash Flow (FCF) and should be factored into the valuation.
