## Business Summary

CleanCore Solutions sells specialized machines primarily to large organizations like schools, hospitals, and hotels (B2B customers) across North America. These dispensing machines use electricity and tap water to instantly create a powerful, non-toxic cleaning agent called stabilized aqueous ozone, eliminating the need for traditional harsh chemicals. The company's revenue model is two-fold: first, they generate sales from the initial purchase or lease of the equipment. Second, and most critical for long-term stability, they earn recurring revenue from the continuous sale of proprietary refill cartridges that customers must buy to keep the machines running.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the potential customer resistance to the relatively high upfront cost of purchasing or leasing the specialized equipment. They compete directly against much larger, established chemical companies (like Ecolab or Diversey) who can leverage scale and existing customer contracts to undercut pricing. Long-term profitability is heavily dependent on the steady stream of recurring revenue from proprietary refill cartridges; if customers fail to adopt the machines widely or find alternative, unauthorized refills, the core business model is severely damaged. Historically, eco-friendly cleaning technology has struggled to gain widespread traction over cheaper, traditional chemicals, and the current concern is that if CleanCore cannot scale up quickly, its smaller size makes it highly vulnerable to intense pricing wars and delays in their component supply chain.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE), a company dedicated to changing how cleaning and disinfection are done.

### **History of CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE)**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **The Original Idea (Pre-2022):** The technology's foundation was laid by a predecessor company, CleanCore Technologies, LLC, which was first formed in 2014.
2.  **The Driving Problem:** The business was founded to address the need for a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cleaning chemicals, which often contain harsh and harmful ingredients.
3.  **Core Mission:** The goal was to revolutionize cleaning by eliminating harmful chemicals and their environmental impact, empowering customers with sustainable solutions that outperform older methods.
4.  **Formal Incorporation (2022):** The current public company, CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE), was formally incorporated in 2022 as a special acquisition company that later purchased the assets of the original CleanCore and two related entities (TetraClean and Food Safety Technology).
5.  **Focus on Key Industries:** The company quickly began focusing on professional, industrial, and home use across major sectors like janitorial services, industrial cleaning, laundry, and food safety.

#### **II. Innovative Solution: Patented Aqueous Ozone Technology**

6.  **The Core Innovation:** The company's technology is centered on generating "aqueous ozone," which is essentially ozone gas dissolved into tap water.
7.  **How it Works (Jargon-Free):** The patented system creates powerful, chemical-free cleaning solutions on demand by passing water through a specialized cell to create ozone. This ozone-infused water then cleans and sanitizes.
8.  **The Unique Edge (Nanobubbles):** CleanCore believes it is the only company with an aqueous ozone solution that is produced in the form of **nanobubbles** (tiny, microscopic bubbles), which they claim makes the cleaning and disinfection more effective.
9.  **Product Lineup:** The technology is built into various products, such as wall-mounted "fill stations" for filling spray bottles and buckets, and portable "POWER CADDY" units for bigger jobs.

#### **III. Tailwinds and Headwinds**

10. **TAILWIND: Global Demand for "Green Cleaning":** A major advantage for the company has been the growing worldwide demand from businesses for eco-friendly products that are effective, safe, and help them meet their own sustainability goals.
11. **TAILWIND: Proving Effectiveness:** The company has a strong track record with pilot programs, claiming a high success rate (around 98%) of converting initial tests with customers into signed contracts, which demonstrates market confidence in their technology.
12. **TAILWIND: Government Market Access:** CleanCore was awarded a General Services Administration (GSA) contract, which is an important development that streamlines its ability to sell products to federal, state, and local government agencies.
13. **TAILWIND: International Expansion:** In 2025, the company completed a strategic move by acquiring the assets of Sanzonate Europe Ltd., a large European distributor of aqueous ozone products, which significantly expanded its international reach and sales pipeline.
14. **HEADWIND: Intense Competition:** Like any technology company, CleanCore must constantly innovate to keep up with competitors and deal with the challenges of a rapidly changing technological and regulatory environment.
15. **HEADWIND: Financial Uncertainty ("Going Concern"):** A major challenge noted in the company's recent financial reports (Form 10-K and 10-Q) is a "going concern" notice; this is a serious accounting flag that means management has substantial doubt about the company's ability to cover its planned expenses over the next 12 months.
16. **HEADWIND: Volatility from Crypto Strategy:** To improve its financial position, the company adopted a highly unconventional strategy of investing a significant portion of its cash into the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), leading to a substantial financial loss when the crypto's value fell.

#### **IV. Present Day**

17. **Current Status:** Despite facing significant financial headwinds, the company is actively expanding, having achieved its first quarter with U.S. revenue surpassing \$1 million and executing major deployments at places like a large international airport.
18. **The Overarching Goal:** CleanCore's ultimate goal remains to solidify its position as a global leader in sustainable cleaning by continuing to push its patented, chemical-free aqueous ozone technology as the superior replacement for traditional, harsher cleaning methods.

## Moat Analysis

The analysis of CleanCore Solutions, Inc.'s (ZONE) competitive advantages, or "moat," revolves primarily around its patented technology, a unique market position, and its ongoing transition to a recurring revenue business model, although this must be considered alongside its current financial challenges.

### Analysis of CleanCore Solutions' Moat (ZONE)

1.  **Technological Differentiation (The Core Moat):** CleanCore's primary competitive advantage is its patented aqueous ozone technology, which creates ozone in the form of nanobubbles. This system produces a powerful, chemical-free cleaner/sanitizer on-demand, differentiating it from competitors who sell traditional packaged cleaning chemicals.

2.  **Special Market Position (Government Contracts):** The company holds an exclusive General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule Contract, which positions it as the only provider of its aqueous ozone cleaning products on a federal purchasing platform. This contract, extendable up to 20 years, provides a long-term, streamlined sales channel to government buyers, a solid advantage that is difficult for competitors to replicate.

3.  **Pricing Advantage for Customers:** The aqueous ozone system is marketed as a low-cost, cost-effective replacement for traditional cleaning chemicals. The customer's savings come from no longer needing to purchase, store, or manage various chemical products, giving CleanCore a strong value proposition in terms of *total cost of ownership*, though this is separate from the company's own pricing power.

4.  **Foundation of Growth (The Reason It Grew):** The company's growth has been fueled by a focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly technology that meets increasing corporate and governmental "green" mandates. This is combined with securing key, high-visibility contracts, such as a major international New York airport, which acts as a reference customer for further enterprise sales.

5.  **Moat-Building Strategy (Shift to Recurring Revenue):** CleanCore has been actively trying to create a solid moat by shifting its business model toward recurring revenue. Contracts with large customers, including a major facility management company, are establishing a continuous, "sticky" revenue stream, moving away from simple one-time sales.

6.  **Investment in Innovation (Patents and R&D):** The company's patents (14-15 patents) on its nanobubble technology are the direct result of past research and development, forming a legal barrier to entry. While the company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge, the existing patents make it difficult for competitors to immediately copy its core product.

7.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital (Significant Risk):** Despite the patent protection, the company faces high risk of displacement. Financial filings indicate the company is unprofitable, has negative cash flow, and has been subject to auditor doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. A competitor with significantly more capital could easily displace them by funding aggressive marketing campaigns, rapidly scaling up distribution, or by simply acquiring the company, as its financial position is weak.

8.  **Network Effects and Stickiness:** True network effects are limited, but securing major enterprise and government contracts creates a form of stickiness. Once a large facility like an airport or a federal agency installs the CleanCore system, the high cost and disruption of switching to a different non-standard system creates a significant practical barrier for the customer.

## Catalyst Analysis

CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE) presents a unique investment case, driven by its traditional chemical-free cleaning technology business and its new, aggressive digital asset treasury strategy centered on Dogecoin.

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Increased Value of Dogecoin (DOGE) Treasury:** The company has an "Official Dogecoin Treasury" holding over 733 million DOGE, which it aims to grow to 5% of the coin’s circulating supply. Any significant price increase in Dogecoin would directly increase the value of CleanCore's balance sheet, creating unrealized gains that attract investor attention.
2.  **Dogecoin Utility Expansion:** Management is focused on "expanding Dogecoin's real-world utility through payments, remittances, and integrations within the global sports and entertainment ecosystem". Successfully launching new payment or remittance systems, or securing major sports partnerships (like its recent ones with European sports clubs), could increase Dogecoin adoption and, consequently, the value of the company's treasury.
3.  **Core Business Revenue Growth:** The company reported a significant year-over-year revenue increase in its cleaning business for Q1 2026. Continued strong financial results and expanding adoption of its aqueous ozone cleaning technology, particularly with large partners like the announced worldwide rollout with a major enterprise software company, will demonstrate fundamental business strength.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)

1.  **GSA Contract and Government Sales:** CleanCore secured a GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract, positioning it as the exclusive provider of aqueous ozone cleaning products to U.S. government agencies. This long-term contract (extendable up to 20 years) provides a stable, large-scale channel for revenue growth in the years to come.
2.  **Improved Core Business Profitability:** Management noted "product reengineering initiatives" are underway with the goal of lowering the cost of goods sold (COGS). Success in reducing production costs while maintaining sales growth could significantly improve gross margins and move the core business toward sustainable profitability.
3.  **Global Market Penetration:** The acquisition of Sanzonate Europe Ltd. gives the company a stronger base and an established multi-million-dollar sales pipeline to accelerate its international expansion. Successfully leveraging this European footprint is key to long-term market share growth in the global commercial cleaning industry.

### Management's Stated Strategy (CEO Clayton Adams)

*   **Dogecoin Treasury:** CEO Clayton Adams stated, "We executed on our vision to establish the world's first Dogecoin Treasury," and the long-term objective is to acquire up to 5% of Dogecoin's circulating supply in a disciplined manner.
*   **Dual Focus:** The strategy is to combine professional treasury governance with initiatives that enhance Dogecoin's transactional use, aiming to position DOGE as a "trusted reserve asset".
*   **Core Business Investment:** The CEO also said the company will "maintain discipline in our core operating business" and "continue to invest in our DOGE portfolio".
*   **Financial Impact:** Management noted that the recent increase in General and Administrative (G&A) expenses and net loss was due to "one-time expenses related to our treasury strategy transaction," but the core business experienced growth and positive cash flow on a stand-alone basis.

## Management Record

The management of CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE) is navigating a significant strategic pivot, which is a critical point for investors to consider.

1.  **Current CEO and Management Tenure:** The current CEO is **Clayton Adams**, appointed in June 2024, who previously served as a Director and President since September 2022. The management team is considered relatively new, with an average tenure of approximately 1.4 years.
2.  **CEO Background and Focus:** Clayton Adams' background is in hypergrowth technology and recurring revenue business models, with a track record that includes expanding a small company (Carson Enterprises, Inc.) and successfully selling it. He holds a notable insider ownership of approximately 3.31% of the company's shares.
3.  **Key Leadership Appointments:** The team includes **Travis Buchanan** (President, appointed Jan 2025), with a strong background in M&A and scaling businesses like American Homes 4 Rent, and **David Enholm** (CFO, since March 2023), who has over 35 years in finance, including company restructuring and acquisitions.
4.  **Major Strategic Pivot to Digital Assets:** The most significant recent decision is the execution of a **"Dogecoin Treasury Strategy,"** with the stated vision to establish the world's first Dogecoin Treasury and a long-term goal of acquiring up to 5% of Dogecoin's circulating supply.
5.  **New Management Driving Treasury Strategy:** The appointment of **Marco Margiotta** as Chief Investment Officer (CIO), the co-founder of Payfare and CEO of House of Doge, reinforces the company's commitment to this new, non-traditional financial model.
6.  **Core Business Strategy and Performance:** Despite the digital asset focus, the core business's strategy remains the development and distribution of patented aqueous ozone technology as a sustainable, cost-effective replacement for traditional cleaning chemicals. The company has delivered on this front by securing a multi-million dollar contract with a global logistics leader and being awarded a GSA contract for government sales.
7.  **Impact on Shareholder Value and Financials:** Over the past year, the stock has significantly underperformed the US market and the US Machinery industry, with a price decrease of nearly 79%. The aggressive treasury strategy led to a large increase in General and Administrative expenses, resulting in a net loss of approximately $13.4 million in Q1 2026, compared to a $0.9 million loss in the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the new strategy.
8.  **Management Track Record on Promises:** Management successfully grew Q1 2026 revenue to $0.9 million, an increase from $0.4 million in the prior year, and quickly expanded their Dogecoin holdings, demonstrating execution on both core business and strategic pivot. CEO Adams has stated that management will consider a share repurchase program if the stock continues to trade at volatile levels, which they view as a temporary pricing dislocation.
9.  **Previous Management Change:** Clayton Adams' appointment as CEO in June 2024 followed a very short tenure for former Chairman and CEO **Douglas T. Moore** (appointed Feb 2024), indicating a rapid change in leadership leading up to or coinciding with the new strategic direction.

## Management Incentive

The management incentive and compensation structure for CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE) presents a complex picture, combining very high insider ownership (suggesting alignment) with specific performance incentives that pose a significant conflict of interest.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership is High:** The total insider ownership by managers and directors is reported to be substantial, estimated at **65.4%**. This high level of insider ownership is generally a positive indicator, as management's personal wealth is heavily tied to the company's long-term stock performance, theoretically aligning their interests with shareholders.
2.  **Compensation is Heavily Equity-Weighted:** Executive compensation packages are strongly weighted toward stock awards, which is a common mechanism for aligning pay with shareholder returns. For example, the CEO's total compensation of $2.14 million for Fiscal Year 2025 was largely driven by a $1.86 million stock award.
3.  **Significant Performance Bonus Tied to Speculative Assets:** The CEO is eligible for a **$200,000 performance bonus** conditional on the company's new digital asset treasury strategy achieving and exceeding a **$100 million valuation**. This metric incentivizes aggressive, speculative accumulation of digital assets over core business profitability.
4.  **Major Conflict of Interest from Related-Party Fees:** This digital asset treasury is co-managed by an entity, Dogecoin Ventures, Inc., which is **affiliated with three key CleanCore executives and directors**. This affiliated entity receives significant fees, up to **2% annually**, based on the treasury's value.
5.  **Incentive to Prioritize Fee Generation Over Shareholder Value:** The compensation structure and related-party fees create a powerful incentive for management to prioritize the growth of the speculative digital asset treasury to trigger both the executive bonus and increase the related-party fees, potentially at the expense of prudent capital allocation and the core business's operational success.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

*   **Mixed Conclusion with Major Concern:** While the high insider ownership (65.4%) suggests management *should* act in the interest of shareholders for long-term equity growth, the highly specific and lucrative performance bonus tied to the digital asset treasury, coupled with the related-party fee structure, presents a clear and material incentive to **"line their own pockets"** through an ancillary, speculative venture.
*   **Risk to Shareholders:** The direct financial incentive for management and affiliated directors appears to favor growing a high-risk digital asset treasury to generate a bonus and related-party fees, rather than focusing solely on the fundamental operational growth and profitability of the company's core products.

## Price History

Based on the price history and technical analysis for CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE), here is an analysis of its recent performance and current position.

1.  **Technical Analysis Signal:** The stock is currently being rated a **"Strong Sell"** by technical indicators, according to platforms like TradingView and Investing.com. This indicates that based on moving averages and other trend-following tools, the stock is trading low and the prevailing trend is negative.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** The stock is trading very near its 52-week low. With a recent price of approximately $0.37 and a 52-week low of $0.3249, the stock is currently about **13.9%** above its 52-week low. This is an extremely low valuation compared to its 52-week high of $7.82.

3.  **Significant Price Drop (Big Drop):** The stock has experienced a massive and rapid price collapse, falling over **91%** in the last three months and approximately 78% over the last month. This plunge led the stock to a record low in mid-November 2025.

4.  **Reason for the Major Drop:** The severe decline is primarily attributed to the company's aggressive and heavily leveraged **Dogecoin (DOGE) treasury strategy**. CleanCore accumulated over 733 million DOGE, which backfired as the cryptocurrency's price fell and coincided with the company reporting a significantly widened net loss of $13.4 million for the fiscal first quarter.

5.  **Quarterly Financials:** The reported financial results for the quarter ending September 30, 2025, showed the net loss widening dramatically to $13.4 million from $0.9 million a year earlier, driven by surging general and administrative expenses related to the new crypto treasury strategy. Despite a core business revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the financial strain and the high-risk nature of the Dogecoin bet.

---

## Long Thesis

The company will succeed because its patented machines make powerful, non-toxic cleaner using just water, saving big customers (like schools and hotels) money and helping them meet environmental goals. The long-term income is secured by mandatory, recurring refill sales, creating a stable income stream. Crucially, its massive, high-risk investment in Dogecoin could pay off huge: if the crypto's price jumps significantly, the company instantly solves its severe financial problems and receives a massive cash injection. This cash will fund rapid global expansion and allow them to fully leverage their exclusive, long-term contract to sell to the entire U.S. government market, positioning them to replace harsh chemicals worldwide.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core cleaning technology must be widely adopted despite its high upfront cost to customers. Management must successfully reduce the production costs of its equipment to achieve true profitability in the core business. Most importantly, the volatile Dogecoin investment must drastically increase in value and offset the current significant financial losses and 'going concern' risk, or else the company will likely fail to cover its operating expenses.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies flaws in the long thesis for CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE) and presents a corresponding bear case.

## Bear Case Thesis & Critique of Long Thesis

### I. Flaws in the Financial & Dogecoin Thesis

1.  **Dogecoin Treasury is a Massive and Immediate Risk, Not a Secured Cash Injection.** The core assumption that the highly volatile Dogecoin investment *will* pay off huge is speculative and has already caused severe consequences. The company has accumulated over 733 million Dogecoin, but the strategy has triggered a market backlash, with the stock collapsing sharply as the price of DOGE experienced a recent downturn and unrealized gains evaporated.
2.  **Dogecoin Strategy Cripples Core Business Profitability.** The massive General and Administrative (G&A) expenses, which soared to **\$8.6 million** in Q1 2026 (up from \$0.9 million a year prior), were primarily driven by costs associated with the Dogecoin treasury strategy (professional fees, stock-based compensation, new salaries, etc.). This strategic expense is directly responsible for the massive net loss of **\$13.4 million** in the quarter, far outweighing the modest revenue, and immediately contradicting any claim that the core business is moving toward profitability.
3.  **Core Business Revenue is Insignificant Compared to Operating Expenses.** Despite strong year-over-year growth (77.7%), the core product revenue for Q1 2026 was only **\$0.9 million**. This small revenue stream is insufficient to cover the company’s operating expenses, even before the new crypto treasury-related G&A costs, confirming the underlying "going concern" risk is not solved but amplified by the new overhead.
4.  **The "Cash Injection" Was a Highly Dilutive Private Placement.** The cash used to acquire the Dogecoin, a \$175 million private placement, came from issuing equity (pre-funded warrants) and not from the realization of product sales or an existing crypto windfall. This influx of capital came at the cost of significant dilution to existing shareholders, and it was immediately converted into a highly volatile digital asset, negating the stability of the cash itself.

### II. Flaws in the Core Business & Expansion Thesis

1.  **GSA Contract Does Not Guarantee Revenue.** While the company secured a General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, this only provides *access* to government buyers. The contract is non-exclusive in terms of sales and does not guarantee a minimum volume of purchase orders, meaning the assumed revenue from the "entire U.S. government market" is highly uncertain.
2.  **High Upfront Cost and Competition Undermine Wide Adoption.** The cleaning technology, while patented and environmentally friendly, requires customers to make a "high upfront cost" investment in the equipment, making it a challenging sell against established, low-cost traditional chemical providers, who remain a significant competitive force. The company has a limited revenue history and must convince the market to shift away from established cleaning brands.
3.  **Recurring Refill Sales Are Dependent on Equipment Placement.** The "stable income stream" from mandatory, recurring refill sales is predicated on the *successful* widespread adoption and continuous use of the high-cost equipment, which has not yet been proven at scale. If the high upfront cost or a breakdown in the equipment lifecycle limits new placements, the supposedly stable revenue base will not materialize rapidly enough to cover soaring expenses.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent, comprehensive analysis that clearly frames the high-risk, high-reward nature of CleanCore Solutions, Inc. (ZONE). The core conflict is clearly identified: a promising, high-margin core business is completely overshadowed by a highly speculative, high-cost Dogecoin treasury strategy that has triggered a financial crisis.

Based on the existing analysis and the recent search results, here are the next steps and most critical unanswered questions to investigate.

### Next Steps & Important Unanswered Questions

#### I. Critical Questions on the Dogecoin Treasury & Financial Viability

1.  **What is the current, post-Q1 impact of the Dogecoin devaluation on the balance sheet?**
    *   *The analysis states the stock fell due to the crypto price drop.* The Q1 2026 report (Sept 30, 2025) noted a subsequent fair value of only **\$131.5 million** for the DOGE holdings, implying an additional unrealized loss *after* the quarter ended. You must find the *actual, current value* of 733.1 million DOGE (or the latest reported amount) to accurately measure the company's net asset value (NAV) and capital runway.

2.  **What is the specific breakdown of the soaring General & Administrative (G&A) expenses?**
    *   G&A expenses jumped from \$0.9M to **\$8.6M** in one quarter, primarily due to the Treasury strategy. Find the specific line items (e.g., professional fees, Dogecoin Ventures fees, stock-based compensation, bonuses) to distinguish between legitimate core business costs and the expenses directly tied to the highly conflicted related-party management structure.

3.  **Has the CEO reversed course or addressed the crisis created by the Dogecoin strategy?**
    *   The CEO threatened a share repurchase to support the stock, but there is no evidence of execution. Search for the **latest investor presentation, press release, or conference call transcript** to determine if the CEO has provided an *updated* strategy to address the "going concern" notice, or if they are doubling down on the Dogecoin accumulation plan.

#### II. Deep Dive into the Core Cleaning Business's Health

4.  **Is the GSA contract generating any revenue yet?**
    *   The GSA contract is a massive long-term catalyst, but it only grants *access* to a government sales channel. Search for any recent **SEC filings or press releases** that specifically mention *purchase orders, revenue figures, or new deployments* directly tied to the GSA contract, rather than just announcing the contract itself.

5.  **What is the customer retention/recurring revenue rate for refill cartridges?**
    *   The long-term thesis hinges on the **"sticky" recurring revenue** from proprietary refill cartridges. You need to find customer retention rates, refill sales volume, or the percentage of total revenue that is *truly* recurring and high-margin, which is key to offsetting the high upfront equipment cost risk.

6.  **What are the key customer metrics for equipment adoption at scale?**
    *   The company cites a major New York international airport and a global logistics company with over 1,000 facilities. Find the **total number of equipment units installed (the "installed base")** and the average revenue per unit. This moves the analysis beyond anecdotal "wins" to a quantifiable model of future revenue growth.

#### III. Share Structure and Insider Actions

7.  **What is the current, fully diluted share count?**
    *   The \$175 million Dogecoin private placement was highly dilutive, involving pre-funded warrants. Determine the *current fully diluted share count* to understand the true impact of this dilution on the stock's per-share valuation and the potential for future shareholder value creation.

8.  **What are the latest insider selling/buying activities?**
    *   Management has a high insider ownership (65.4%), but the conflict of interest is material. Check for any recent **Form 4 filings (insider transactions)** to see if executives are *selling* shares (profiting from the pre-placement price surge) or *buying* shares (showing confidence in the company's future after the crash).
