## I. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Atkore Inc. is driven by the cyclical US construction industry, coupled with major infrastructure and technology-related projects. The recent financial performance (Q3 FY2025) shows a significant decrease in Net Income and Gross Margin due to **price normalization** (especially in PVC and steel conduit) and softness in the telecom market, contrasting with high-profit years driven by pandemic-era price spikes. This is the central, conservative assumption for the forecast: the abnormally high margins of the past will not return.

**Management Commentary & Drivers (Q4 2024 to Q3 2025 Transcripts):**
1.  **Pricing Pressure:** Average selling prices decreased significantly (e.g., in PVC and steel conduit) and are the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. The high margins seen in 2024 are clearly a historical anomaly that will not be repeated.
2.  **Volume Growth:** The company anticipates **low to mid-single-digit volume growth** in FY2025, with growth coming from both segments.
3.  **Strategic Growth Areas:** The company is focused on long-term growth in:
    *   **Solar Torque Tubes:** Driven by renewable energy infrastructure.
    *   **Global Mega Projects:** Construction services for data centers and chip manufacturing plants (semiconductors).
    *   **Regional Service Centers:** To enhance customer service and market reach.

### Revenue Assumptions

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Actual)** | **3,200.0** | - | Peak pricing year. |
| **FY2025 (Projection)** | **3,050.0** | -4.7% | **Conservative midpoint of guidance range (\$2.9B to \$3.2B)**. The slight decline reflects the overwhelming impact of price normalization offsetting low to mid-single-digit volume growth. |
| **FY2026 (Projection)** | **3,141.5** | 3.0% | **Conservative rebound.** Reflects a stabilization of metal prices and modest 3% organic volume/price growth, fueled by initial contributions from solar and mega projects as price normalization fades. |
| **FY2027 (Projection)** | **3,277.6** | 4.3% | **Accelerating Mega Projects.** Growth increases to 4.3%, slightly above historical US industrial/construction growth, reflecting increasing deployment of new mega projects (data centers, chips) and continued solar growth. |
| **FY2028 (Projection)** | **3,414.7** | 4.2% | **Sustained Infrastructure Spending.** Maintains strong growth as federal infrastructure and large-scale manufacturing projects remain in their major construction phases. |
| **FY2029 (Projection)** | **3,524.7** | 3.2% | **Deceleration to Long-Term Trend.** Growth begins to moderate as the largest construction projects mature, moving toward long-term GDP growth. |
| **FY2030 (Projection)** | **3,612.8** | 2.5% | **Conservative Long-Term Growth.** Settles into a 2.5% rate, slightly above the long-term US GDP average, reflecting a stable, mature industrial business. |

## II. Margin & Net Income Projection

### Margin Assumptions

| Metric | Historical / Guidance | Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin** | Q3 FY2025: 23.4% | Stabilizes at **25.0%** | A conservative recovery from the Q3 2025 low (23.4%) but well below the peak margins (e.g., 34.0% in Q3 FY2024). This assumes efficient cost management and some strategic pricing power in growing segments like solar, but acknowledges the competitive reality of price normalization. |
| **Net Income Margin** | FY2024: 14.8% (472.9/3200.0) | Stabilizes at **7.18%** (Based on FY2025 projection) | **FY2025 Target:** The midpoint Adjusted EPS of \$6.50 translates to an Adjusted Net Income of \$218.8M. This represents a Net Income Margin of 7.18% (\$218.8M / \$3,050M). We will use a conservative, stable GAAP Net Income margin of **7.20%** for the forecast period (2026-2030). |

### Net Income Calculation

A key rule for this valuation is: *Net income for next year = net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

#### Historical ROIC Calculation:

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is Net Income / Invested Capital (Total Debt + Total Equity).
*   **FY2024 Net Income:** \$472.9M
*   **Invested Capital (as of 9/30/2024 - from previous step's data):** Total Debt (\$764.8M) + Total Equity (\$1,539.9M) = \$2,304.7M.
*   **FY2024 ROIC:** \$472.9M / \$2,304.7M = **20.5%**

**ROIC Assumption:** A historical ROIC of 20.5% is unsustainably high and a relic of the peak pricing era. The rule requires a *conservative but reasonable positive ROIC %*. I will conservatively assume a reinvestment rate on accumulated cash at a **5.0% ROIC** (reflective of a strong, mature industrial company's ability to generate returns on internal investments/acquisitions).

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Inc. Margin | Net Inc. from Operations (B) = A \* Margin | Prior Year Acc. Cash (C) | ROIC % | ROIC Income (D) = C \* 5.0% | Total Net Income (E) = B + D | Accum. Cash for Next Year (F) = C + E |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Actual)** | 3,200.0 | 14.8% | 472.9 | 331.0* | 20.5% | - | 472.9 | 803.9 |
| **FY2025** | 3,050.0 | 7.18% | 218.8 | 803.9 | 5.0% | 40.2 | **259.0** | 1,062.9 |
| **FY2026** | 3,141.5 | 7.20% | 226.2 | 1,062.9 | 5.0% | 53.1 | **279.3** | 1,342.2 |
| **FY2027** | 3,277.6 | 7.20% | 236.0 | 1,342.2 | 5.0% | 67.1 | **303.1** | 1,645.3 |
| **FY2028** | 3,414.7 | 7.20% | 245.8 | 1,645.3 | 5.0% | 82.3 | **328.1** | 1,973.4 |
| **FY2029** | 3,524.7 | 7.20% | 253.8 | 1,973.4 | 5.0% | 98.7 | **352.5** | 2,325.9 |
| **FY2030** | 3,612.8 | 7.20% | 260.1 | 2,325.9 | 5.0% | 116.3 | **376.4** | 2,702.3 |

*\*Starting Cash balance is the Q3 FY2025 amount of \$331.0M. The FY2024 Net Income is assumed to be fully realized into cash before the start of the projection.*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Total Net Income for each year represents the cash flow to equity (assuming Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year).

### DCF Assumptions

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative rate, above the historical average market return and reflects the inherent cyclicality and commodity price exposure of the electrical equipment and construction materials industry.
2.  **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate - Very Conservative):** **2.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a very conservative rate, below long-term US GDP growth and below the projected final year's growth (2.5%), reflecting a mature company and potential future industry saturation.

### Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

$$ \text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{FY2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}} $$

$$ \text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$376.4 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$383.9}{0.08} = \$4,798.8 \text{ million} $$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (FY) | Cash Flow (E) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 259.0 | 0.909 | 235.4 |
| **2026** | 279.3 | 0.826 | 230.7 |
| **2027** | 303.1 | 0.751 | 227.6 |
| **2028** | 328.1 | 0.683 | 223.9 |
| **2029** | 352.5 | 0.621 | 218.9 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | 376.4 | 0.564 | 212.3 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | 4,798.8 | 0.564 | 2,709.8 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$4,058.6 million** |

---

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV of Future Cash Flows} - \text{Total Debt} + \text{Current Cash} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$4,058.6 \text{ million} - \$764.4 \text{ million} + \$331.0 \text{ million} = \$3,625.2 \text{ million} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$3,625.2 \text{ million}}{33.66 \text{ million shares}} = \$107.71 $$

---

## V. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value per Share: **\$107.71**

### Market Price vs. Fair Value

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$107.71** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$70.00** |

### Justification

The calculated Fair Value of **\$107.71** is **53.9% higher** than the current market price of \$70.00.

**Why the Disparity?**

The market is making a clear set of assumptions that differ from this conservative, DCF-based projection:

1.  **Market Assumption: Permanent Margin Compression.**
    *   The market is heavily discounting ATKR based on the sharp decline in gross margin (from 34.0% to 23.4% in one year) and the overall lower Net Income guidance for FY2025. It likely believes the 'new normal' Net Income Margin will be lower than the **7.20%** projected here, or that the decline will continue into 2026. This implies the market views the price normalization and commodity pricing pressures as a permanent structural issue rather than a cyclical adjustment from an unsustainable peak.
2.  **Valuation Assumption: Stabilization and Strategic Growth.**
    *   This valuation assumes that after a one-time reset in FY2025 (to a 7.18% margin), the company's operational strength, cost-management initiatives, and strategic investments in high-growth areas (**Solar Torque Tubes, Global Mega Projects/Data Centers**) will allow it to stabilize and generate modest, profitable growth (2.5% to 4.3% revenue growth, and a stable 7.20% net income margin).
    *   Crucially, the **5.0% ROIC** assumption on accumulated cash is a conservative anchor. If the company continues to execute on its M&A strategy (fueled by high cash generation), its actual ROIC on invested capital could be much higher, which would significantly increase the fair value.
3.  **Risk & Discounting:**
    *   The market may be using a **higher implicit discount rate** than the conservative 10.0% used here, reflecting higher perceived risk associated with the CEO transition and the volatility of the construction end-markets.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value suggests that the market is excessively focused on the short-term margin compression and is *not* fully valuing the future stable cash flow generation potential from the company's strong positioning in high-growth, high-multiple infrastructure end-markets (Renewable Energy, Data Centers, and Semiconductors). This valuation, despite being based on conservative long-term growth (2.0% terminal) and a modest ROIC (5.0%), suggests Atkore is **significantly undervalued** based on its fundamental ability to generate consistent, albeit lower than peak, net income.
