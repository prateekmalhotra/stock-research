## The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) Stock Valuation

### 1. Initial Financial Data (As of Q1 Fiscal Year 2025, ended September 30, 2024)

All figures are in **millions USD** unless otherwise noted.

| Metric | Source/Notes | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | Q1 FY2025 (Sept 30, 2024) Earnings Release. [cite: 5 in step 3] | **\$2,350** |
| **Total Debt** | Long-Term Debt (FY2024 10-K data) plus a conservative estimate for current portion. [cite: 2 in step 4] | **\$7,517** |
| **FY 2024 Net Sales** | FY 2024 (Jun 30, 2024) Earnings Release. [cite: 1 in step 3] | **\$15,610** |
| **FY 2024 GAAP Net Earnings** | FY 2024 (Jun 30, 2024) Earnings Release. [cite: 1 in step 3] | **\$390** |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | Based on the FY 2024 10-K diluted share count. [cite: 4 in step 3] | **360.8 million** |
| **Current Stock Price (Approximation)** | *Market data not used as per rule.* The valuation result will be compared to the market. | |

**Note on Total Debt:** The total debt figure is calculated as the FY2024 reported Long-Term Debt of \$7,267 million [cite: 2 in step 4], plus an estimated current portion of long-term debt of \$250 million for a conservative total.

### 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The foundation of this valuation is EL’s **Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP)**, which is the management-guided engine for future earnings. The recent fiscal year (FY2024) Net Income Margin was severely depressed at 2.50% ($\frac{\$390}{\$15,610}$) due to significant impairment charges and litigation settlements [cite: 1 in step 3]. The valuation assumes a phased recovery.

#### A. Revenue Engine

The key drivers are the recovery in Asia Travel Retail and Mainland China, alongside growth in high-demand channels (specialty multi, online) and brands (La Mer, Le Labo, The Ordinary).

*   **FY 2025 (Starting Point):** Management guided for an Organic Net Sales Growth of -1% to +2%. To be conservative, we assume growth will be at the very low end of the positive range, giving a slight organic sales lift, but revenue will be further boosted by the impact of recent acquisitions (e.g., Tom Ford, DECIEM) which are captured in reported sales.
    *   **Assumption:** **FY2025 Reported Net Sales Growth: 1.5%**
*   **FY 2026 - FY 2030 (Normalization):** The global prestige beauty market typically grows in the mid-to-high single digits. Following the successful execution of the PRGP (ending in FY2026), the company is expected to return to its historical growth rate, which has averaged around $7\%$ in the past decade. Given the mandate for conservatism, we model a return to more modest growth.
    *   **Assumption:** **FY2026-FY2027: 5.0%** (Post-recovery acceleration)
    *   **Assumption:** **FY2028-FY2030: 4.0%** (Conservative, long-term luxury/prestige growth)

| Fiscal Year (FY) | Revenue Growth Rate (YoY) | Projected Net Sales (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | \$15,610 |
| **2025 (Conservative Guided)** | 1.5% | **\$15,844** |
| **2026 (Post-PRGP Kick-in)** | 5.0% | **\$16,636** |
| **2027** | 5.0% | **\$17,468** |
| **2028** | 4.0% | **\$18,167** |
| **2029** | 4.0% | **\$18,893** |
| **2030** | 4.0% | **\$19,649** |

#### B. Margin Engine (Net Income Margin)

The PRGP is expected to deliver incremental operating profit of **\$1.25 billion** (midpoint of \$1.1B - \$1.4B) over FY2025 and FY2026. [cite: 10 in step 1] We will model this directly into the operating income recovery.

*   **FY 2024 Actual Operating Income (OI):** \$970 million. [cite: 1 in step 3]
*   **PRGP Impact:** Assume $\mathbf{\$625M}$ in incremental OI for FY2025 and $\mathbf{\$625M}$ for FY2026.
*   **Operating Margin Stabilization:** Post-2026, the OI Margin is expected to normalize at a sustainable level. The FY2024 Adjusted Operating Margin was $\approx 10.5\%$. A conservative long-term OI margin is assumed to be $\mathbf{12.0\%}$.
*   **Tax Rate:** The FY2024 reported tax rate was very high at $47.0\%$ due to non-deductible charges. [cite: 1 in step 3] We will use a more normalized and conservative long-term tax rate of **25.0%**.

| FY | Projected OI (M) | OI Margin | Tax Rate | Net Income Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$970 | 6.21% | 47.0% | 2.50% |
| **2025 (PRGP Year 1)** | $\$970 + \$625 = \$1,595$ | 10.07% | 25.0% | 7.55% |
| **2026 (PRGP Year 2)** | $\$1,595 + \$625 = \$2,220$ | 13.34% | 25.0% | 10.01% |
| **2027** | 12.50% (Slight pull-back) | \$2,184 | 25.0% | 9.38% |
| **2028 - 2030** | 12.00% (Conservative LT) | *Calculated* | 25.0% | 9.00% |

### 3. Net Income Forecast (Incorporating ROIC)

The valuation requires: $Net Income_{Next Year} = Net Income_{From Business} + ROIC \times (Net Income_{Previous Year})$

First, we must establish a conservative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). Given the FY2024 results were heavily impacted by one-time charges, the GAAP ROIC is not representative. Instead, we use a conservative figure based on what a high-quality, luxury goods company should generate in a non-disrupted year.

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **8.0%**

This assumption is conservative for a luxury brand with significant intangible assets (brand value) that typically has high ROIC, but reflects the recent headwinds and mandate for conservatism.

**FY2025 Net Income Calculation:**
*   $Net Income_{Business} = \$15,844 \times 10.07\% \times (1 - 0.25) = \mathbf{\$1,196M}$
*   $Net Income_{ROIC} = 8.0\% \times Net Income_{FY2024} = 8.0\% \times \$390M = \$31M$
*   $Total Net Income_{FY2025} = \$1,196M + \$31M = \mathbf{\$1,227M}$

| FY | Net Sales (M) | Net Income from Business (A) (M) | Net Income from ROIC (B) (M) | Total Net Income (A+B) (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$15,610 | N/A | N/A | **\$390** (Actual) |
| **2025** | \$15,844 | \$1,196 | \$31 | **\$1,227** |
| **2026** | \$16,636 | \$1,665 | \$98 | **\$1,763** |
| **2027** | \$17,468 | \$1,638 | \$141 | **\$1,779** |
| **2028** | \$18,167 | \$1,635 | \$142 | **\$1,777** |
| **2029** | \$18,893 | \$1,700 | \$142 | **\$1,842** |
| **2030** | \$19,649 | \$1,768 | \$147 | **\$1,915** |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The final step is to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected Net Income (used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity, FCFE) and the Terminal Value.

#### A. DCF Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC/Cost of Equity):** **9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* A conservative but reasonable rate for a large, established, globally diversified, but non-cyclical luxury/prestige company that recently experienced significant operational headwinds. It is higher than the historical average for stable consumer staples to account for higher perceived risk during the recovery period.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.5%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a very conservative long-term growth rate, well below the historical global GDP growth rate, reflecting the conservative mandate and the mature nature of the company's markets.

#### B. NPV Calculation

| FY | Year | Total Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 1 | \$1,227 | 0.9174 | \$1,126 |
| **2026** | 2 | \$1,763 | 0.8417 | \$1,484 |
| **2027** | 3 | \$1,779 | 0.7722 | \$1,374 |
| **2028** | 4 | \$1,777 | 0.7084 | \$1,259 |
| **2029** | 5 | \$1,842 | 0.6499 | \$1,197 |
| **2030** | 6 | \$1,915 | 0.5963 | \$1,141 |
| **Sum of Projected NPVs (2025-2030):** | | | | **\$7,581** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) is the value of all future cash flows beyond 2030.

*   $\mathbf{TV_{2030}} = \frac{Net Income_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$
*   $\mathbf{TV_{2030}} = \frac{\$1,915M \times (1 + 0.025)}{0.09 - 0.025} = \frac{\$1,963.88M}{0.065} = \mathbf{\$30,214M}$

*   $\mathbf{NPV\ of\ TV} = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   $\mathbf{NPV\ of\ TV} = \$30,214M \times 0.5963 = \mathbf{\$18,016M}$

#### D. Total Enterprise Value (Equity Value)

*   $\mathbf{Total\ NPV\ (Equity\ Value)} = \text{Sum of Projected NPVs} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
*   $\mathbf{Total\ NPV} = \$7,581M + \$18,016M = \mathbf{\$25,597M}$

### 5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (NPV)** | \$25,597 |
| **(+) Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$2,350 |
| **(-) Total Debt** | \$7,517 |
| **Total Fair Value of Common Equity** | $\mathbf{\$20,430}$ |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding (M)** | 360.8 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\frac{\$20,430M}{360.8M} = \mathbf{\$56.62}$ |

## Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) Stock: **\$56.62**

**Current Market Value Comparison:** *Assuming the current market price (as of the context date, October 29, 2025) is approximately **\$95** (as hinted in the initial search results).*

### Justification for Difference

The calculated fair value of **\$56.62** is significantly *lower* than the approximate current market price of **\$95**. This substantial difference suggests that the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about EL's future performance than the conservative model presented here.

**Why the Market is More Optimistic (Market's Assumptions):**

1.  **Faster and Stronger Recovery in Asia:** The market is likely pricing in a swift and V-shaped recovery in the high-margin Asia Travel Retail and Mainland China markets, which are the main engines for EL's premium skincare brands (La Mer, Estée Lauder). This means the market's assumed **Revenue Growth Rate** for FY2025 and FY2026 is likely in the *high single digits* to *low double digits*, rather than the conservative $1.5\%$ to $5.0\%$ used here.
2.  **Higher Terminal Margin/Growth:** The market likely believes that the PRGP will lead to a sustained **Operating Margin well above $12\%$** (closer to its historical peak of $16\%$ to $18\%$) and a higher **Terminal Growth Rate** (closer to $3.0\%$ - $3.5\%$), believing that EL's prestige position shields it from long-term slowing growth.
3.  **Higher ROIC / FCF Conversion:** The market may be assuming that FCFE (cash flow) is significantly higher than the Net Income proxy, perhaps due to a lower CapEx or better working capital management not fully captured by Net Income. It may also assume a much higher **ROIC** (closer to $15\% - 20\%$ to reflect its luxury brand equity) which would substantially increase the Net Income forecast.

**Why the Conservative Valuation is Lower (Model's Assumptions):**

1.  **Conservative Revenue Trajectory:** The model's $\mathbf{1.5\%}$ growth for FY2025 and stabilization at $4.0\%$ assumes that the weakness in China and Travel Retail is *structural* and *protracted*, and that competition from local players and other global brands will limit EL's ability to fully recapture past peak growth rates.
2.  **Modest ROIC/Margin Recovery:** The model uses an $\mathbf{8.0\%}$ ROIC and a $\mathbf{12.0\%}$ long-term Operating Margin, which provides limited benefit from the "luxury" positioning compared to the high-teens margins it generated at its peak. This reflects the significant recent disruptions (inventory issues, geopolitical tension, China softness) as a persistent headwind.
3.  **Conservative Discount Rate:** The $\mathbf{9.0\%}$ discount rate is a reasonable choice to account for the risk inherent in a turnaround story, effectively penalizing future cash flows more heavily than the market appears to be doing.

**Conclusion:**

The market is pricing EL as a high-growth, high-margin, blue-chip luxury stock on the cusp of a rapid turnaround. The conservative valuation of **\$56.62** suggests that if the PRGP falls short of the \$1.25 billion target, the recovery in China/Travel Retail is slow, or long-term growth merely normalizes at a modest pace, the stock is significantly **overvalued** at its current price. The gap represents the market's confidence in management's ability to execute a near-perfect operational and geographic recovery, which carries considerable execution risk.
