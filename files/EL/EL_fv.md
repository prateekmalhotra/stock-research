## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2026-2030)

The core of the business engine analysis relies on the last four earnings call transcripts (Q3 FY2025, Q4 FY2025, Q1 FY2026, Q2 FY2026). The company is navigating a significant operational transformation called the "Profit Recovery and Growth Plan" (PRGP) while facing headwinds, most notably in the global travel retail channel and softened demand in Mainland China.

**Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Revenue Growth Driver (The "Engine"):** Revenue growth is expected to pivot from the traditional reliance on high-volume travel retail to a more diversified, multi-channel approach driven by:
    *   **Strategic Investments:** Increased consumer-facing investments (a 480 basis point increase in Q3 FY2025) in marketing and advertising to enhance brand equity and drive consumer acquisition.
    *   **Channel Expansion:** Gaining share in key markets (U.S., China, Japan), and accelerating online growth through expansion on platforms like Amazon and TikTok Shop.
    *   **Innovation:** Focus on high-growth categories like skincare and fragrance (which grew 6% organically in Q2 FY2026) and a continued pipeline of new product launches.
    *   **PRGP Efficiencies:** Cost-saving measures are expected to offset volume deleverage and fund growth investments.

2.  **Conservative Revenue Growth Estimates:**

| Fiscal Year | Initial Base Net Sales (USD Million) | Growth Rate Justification (Conservative) | Projected Net Sales (USD Million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025 (Actual)** | $14,326 | Reported. | $14,326 |
| **FY 2026** | $14,326 | Management guidance is 1%-3% organic net sales growth; using the lowest end: **1%**. | $14,469 |
| **FY 2027** | $14,469 | Assuming the initial PRGP benefits and normalization of the travel retail environment begin to show; conservative growth of **4%**. | $15,048 |
| **FY 2028** | $15,048 | PRGP fully executed, leveraging new channels (Amazon/TikTok), and a moderate recovery in China/Travel Retail. Conservative estimate of **5%**. | $15,800 |
| **FY 2029** | $15,800 | Continued strong execution in core prestige beauty markets; stabilizing at a **5%** growth rate, reflecting the long-term historical growth of the global prestige beauty market. | $16,590 |
| **FY 2030** | $16,590 | Maintaining the long-term stable growth rate of **5%**. | $17,420 |

---

## III. Margin and Net Income Projections (2026-2030)

The projection of margins is heavily weighted on the PRGP's expected margin expansion.

1.  **Gross Margin (GM) Assumption:**
    *   FY 2025 GM was 74.0%.
    *   Q2 FY 2026 GM was 76.5%, driven by operational efficiencies from PRGP.
    *   **Assumption:** Given the strong execution of PRGP and a focus on efficiency, the GM will stabilize at a conservative but higher level than FY2025. We project a gradual increase to **75.5%** by FY2027 and maintain it.

2.  **Net Income (NI) Margin Assumption:**
    *   The company reported a significant net loss in FY 2025 due to non-core items (impairment charges, restructuring charges). Normalizing for these one-time events is critical.
    *   Management's guidance suggests a return to profitability and margin expansion (Operating Margin of 14.4% in Q2 FY2026).
    *   **Assumption:** We project a conservative Net Income Margin based on a normalized recovery post-PRGP. We assume a conservative Net Income Margin progression to a long-term target of **10.0%** by FY2028, below the company's historical pre-pandemic high-teens operating margin, to remain conservative.

| Fiscal Year | Net Sales (USD Million) | Gross Margin % (GM) | Net Income Margin % (NI %) | Net Income (USD Million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025 (Actual)** | $14,326 | 74.0% | -7.9% | $(1,133)$ |
| **FY 2026 (Projection)** | $14,469 | 75.0% | 5.0% | $723$ |
| **FY 2027 (Projection)** | $15,048 | 75.5% | 8.0% | $1,204$ |
| **FY 2028 (Projection)** | $15,800 | 75.5% | 10.0% | $1,580$ |
| **FY 2029 (Projection)** | $16,590 | 75.5% | 10.0% | $1,659$ |
| **FY 2030 (Projection)** | $17,420 | 75.5% | 10.0% | $1,742$ |

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### A. Cash Flow & ROIC

The methodology requires that net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year, and an additional income component is generated by applying a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) percentage to the net income from the previous year.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Based on the company's historical performance, and accounting for the negative FY2025 loss and the required conservatism, we assume a conservative, reasonable long-term **ROIC of 15%**. This is a reasonable target for a prestige beauty company that is successfully executing a cost-savings and growth-focused restructuring plan.

*   **Net Income for Valuation (Cash Flow Proxy):**
    $$NI_{Valuation, year} = NI_{from NI \% , year} + (NI_{from NI \% , year-1} \times ROIC)$$

| Fiscal Year | Net Income (USD Million) | ROIC Additional Income (NI * 15%) | Total Cash Flow Proxy (USD Million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2026** | $723$ | N/A (Using NI only for first year) | $723$ |
| **FY 2027** | $1,204$ | $723 \times 15\% = 108$ | $1,204 + 108 = 1,312$ |
| **FY 2028** | $1,580$ | $1,204 \times 15\% = 181$ | $1,580 + 181 = 1,761$ |
| **FY 2029** | $1,659$ | $1,580 \times 15\% = 237$ | $1,659 + 237 = 1,896$ |
| **FY 2030** | $1,742$ | $1,659 \times 15\% = 249$ | $1,742 + 249 = 1,991$ |

### B. Discount and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%** (Reflects the risk profile of a mature, but cyclical and recently volatile, prestige consumer staple company).
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth):** **2.5%** (A conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above global inflation, representing the company's long-term potential as a leader in prestige beauty).

1.  **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (at the end of FY 2030):**
    $$TV = \frac{CF_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
    $$TV = \frac{\$1,991 \times (1 + 0.025)}{0.090 - 0.025} = \frac{\$2,041}{0.065} \approx \$31,400 \text{ million}$$

2.  **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Fiscal Year (N) | Cash Flow Proxy (CF) (USD Million) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 9.0%) ^ N) | Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) (USD Million) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (N=1)** | $723$ | 0.9174 | $663$ |
| **2027 (N=2)** | $1,312$ | 0.8417 | $1,104$ |
| **2028 (N=3)** | $1,761$ | 0.7722 | $1,360$ |
| **2029 (N=4)** | $1,896$ | 0.7084 | $1,343$ |
| **2030 (N=5)** | $1,991$ | 0.6499 | $1,294$ |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | $31,400$ | 0.6499 | $20,407$ |
| **Total NPV (Sum of DCFs)** | | | **$26,171$** |

## V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value (USD Million) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $26,171$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $2,921$ |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $7,317$ |
| **Equity Value** | **$21,775$** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $359.89$ million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$60.51** |

### B. Justification of Difference between Fair Value and Market Price

*   **Calculated Fair Value:** **$60.51**
*   **Current Market Price:** **$108.23**

The calculated fair value is significantly lower than the current market price (a discount of approximately 44%).

**Justification for the Valuation Gap:**

The difference suggests the market is pricing in a **much more aggressive and rapid recovery** than the conservative assumptions used in this DCF model.

1.  **Revenue Growth:** The market likely assumes a quick return to pre-headwind growth rates ($15.91 billion in FY2023). Our model uses a conservative 1% growth for FY2026, building to 5% by FY2028. The market is likely pricing a quicker acceleration, perhaps 8-10% growth immediately following FY2026, which would drastically increase the NPV.
2.  **Margin Recovery:** Our model assumes a steady-state Net Income Margin of a conservative 10.0% by FY2028. Before the recent downturn, EL's operating margin was often in the high-teens. If the market believes the PRGP will successfully restore operating margins to **15-18%** quickly, or that the **Net Income Margin will reach 12-14%**, the resulting cash flows would be much higher. The Q2 FY2026 operating margin of 14.4% suggests our 10% Net Income Margin target might be too conservative, as Net Income is generally lower than Operating Income but higher than the 11.4% operating margin achieved in Q3 FY2025.
3.  **Risk and Discount Rate:** Our Discount Rate of **9.0%** reflects a perception of moderate risk due to volatility in China and travel retail. The market, anticipating a successful turnaround driven by the PRGP, may be using a lower, more aggressive discount rate (e.g., 7.5% - 8.0%), reflecting a lower perceived risk for a blue-chip company. A 7.5% discount rate would increase the NPV significantly.
4.  **ROIC Assumption:** Our ROIC assumption of 15% is conservative. EL's strong brand portfolio could reasonably command a higher long-term ROIC of **18-20%**, a key feature of a premium brand engine.

**Conclusion:**

The market is making a clear assumption that **The Estée Lauder Companies' "Profit Recovery and Growth Plan" (PRGP) will be an unqualified success**, leading to a much faster return to high-teens operating margins and pre-headwind growth rates (5%+), likely starting in FY2027. My valuation is based on **conservative assumptions**, particularly on the pace of margin recovery and the long-term growth rate, which leads to a lower Fair Value. The $108.23 market price reflects a premium for this expected, high-speed, successful execution of the restructuring plan.
