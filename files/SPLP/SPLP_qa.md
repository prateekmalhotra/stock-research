## Business Summary

Steel Partners Holdings L.P. operates as a highly diversified holding company, meaning it owns and manages a portfolio of various independent businesses, primarily focusing on industrial manufacturing, energy services, and supply chain logistics. The company generates revenue from the profits of these subsidiary operations, rather than selling one primary product. Its customer base is largely other businesses (B2B) across North America and globally, serving demanding sectors like infrastructure, automotive parts, and the oil and gas industry. The core business model involves acquiring controlling stakes in specialized or undervalued companies and then applying operational improvements to increase their long-term value and profitability.

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk is the cyclical nature of the industrial and energy sectors where its subsidiaries operate. If global manufacturing slows down or commodity prices (like oil) fall, demand for the company's components and services immediately drops, severely harming current earnings. This threat has historically caused significant revenue volatility across all industrial holding companies. A key long-term risk relates to capital allocation and integration: the entire business model depends on management's ability to select the right companies to acquire and successfully merge them into the portfolio. If Steel Partners overpays for an acquisition or fails to improve a newly purchased company, it permanently harms its financial position and reputation for successful portfolio management.

## Company History

Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) is a publicly traded, diversified global holding company that owns and operates a variety of businesses across different industries. Its long-term goal is to acquire undervalued companies, apply its internal operational strategies to improve them, and increase the value for its shareholders.

Here is a detailed history of the company from its inception to the present day:

### **Inception and Founding Goal (1990–2008)**

1.  **Founding as a Private Investment Firm (1990):** The company was founded in February 1990 by Warren G. Lichtenstein as a private investment firm, starting with a modest $600,000 in assets.
2.  **The Founding Idea:** Its initial investment strategy was to act as an activist, value-oriented investor, meaning they sought out publicly traded companies they believed were undervalued or poorly managed.
3.  **The Name's Origin:** The name "Steel Partners" came from its first target: acquiring Kinark Corporation to focus on its profitable hot-dip steel galvanizing plants while selling off its non-core assets like hotels and a packaging division.
4.  **First Major Challenge & Solution:** The first target, Kinark, implemented Steel Partners' strategic plan themselves, causing the stock price to rise. This was a challenge to the acquisition plan but ultimately a successful financial outcome, as Steel Partners sold their shares for a profit and moved on to their next target, SL Industries, in 1992.
5.  **International Expansion:** The firm expanded its investment reach internationally, launching separate funds focused on specific regions, such as the Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund L.P. (2002) and Steel Partners China Access I L.P. (2006).

### **The Pivotal Shift: Headwind and Restructuring (2008–2012)**

6.  **Major Headwind: The Financial Crisis and Redemptions (2008):** In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the fund faced a major problem when investors requested to pull out (redeem) about 38% of the fund’s total assets, following a significant loss in value.
7.  **Innovative Solution: Creating a Permanent Holding Company (SPLP):** To stop the outflow of capital and preserve its long-term investment strategy, Steel Partners restructured its hedge fund operations. The result, in December 2008, was the creation of **Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP)**, which transformed the assets into a "permanent capital vehicle."
8.  **The Legal Challenge:** This restructuring was controversial, leading to a lawsuit from certain investors who argued the process was unfair and demanded an "orderly liquidation." The Delaware Chancery Court ultimately allowed the plan to proceed.
9.  **Going Public:** By converting from an open-ended investment fund to a global diversified holding company, the new entity, Steel Partners Holdings L.P., was able to list its common units on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in April 2012.

### **The Modern SPLP and Operational Strategy (2012–Present)**

10. **The Current Business Goal:** SPLP's ultimate goal remains the same: to be a long-term owner of businesses that increases corporate value for all stakeholders through a combination of strategic acquisitions and operational improvements.
11. **Internal Innovative Solution: Operational Excellence Programs:** A core part of their success is the "Steel Partners Operational Excellence Programs." These internal strategies, which include process improvement techniques like **Lean Manufacturing** and **Six Sigma**, are implemented across all their businesses to aggressively reduce waste and improve efficiency.
12. **The Shared Service Tailwind:** The company established a "Purchasing Council" and other "Corporate Services" to consolidate buying power across all its subsidiary companies, allowing them to gain significant cost savings on large purchases like materials, freight, and even insurance.
13. **Building Diversified Segments:** SPLP grew into distinct segments through various acquisitions:
    *   **Financial Services:** This segment is anchored by **WebBank**, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered bank that provides digital consumer and commercial loans nationwide.
    *   **Diversified Industrial:** This includes manufacturers of engineered niche industrial products like HandyTube (tubing), Lucas Milhaupt (joining materials), and OMG (specialty fasteners for construction).
    *   **Supply Chain:** They established this segment with investments in, and eventual full acquisition of, **Steel Connect** (which operates **ModusLink**), a global provider of supply chain and e-commerce solutions.
14. **Strategic Acquisition Tailwinds:** A key strategic acquisition was when their subsidiary, Steel Connect, acquired **IWCO Direct** in 2017. This deal was structured to allow them to utilize a massive tax benefit (**Net Operating Loss carryforwards**) held by Steel Connect, which acted as a major tailwind to the investment's profitability.
15. **Recent Operational Headwinds:** Like many manufacturers, the company has faced recent challenges, including the need to resolve ongoing global **supply chain issues**, particularly those impacting their defense and aerospace programs.
16. **Recent Corporate Headwind:** A high-profile example of the challenges faced as an activist investor was the 2022 proxy contest at Aerojet Rocketdyne, where a majority of shareholders voted to remove the CEO and all Steel Partners-selected board members, signaling an investor disagreement with their influence.
17. **Present Day:** Steel Partners Holdings L.P. is a multi-billion dollar entity that has successfully transformed from a private activist hedge fund into a permanent public holding company that continuously buys, improves, and operates businesses across a wide range of industries globally.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) is not built on a single, dominant technology or brand but rather on a unique, internally focused business model that extracts maximum efficiency and scale from a diverse portfolio of companies. It is a "corporate parenting" advantage, where the parent company adds value to its subsidiaries that they would not be able to achieve on their own.

### **Analysis of the Moat: The Corporate Parenting Advantage**

1.  **Unique Operating Model (The Moat):** The company's primary moat is the **Steel Business System (SBS)**, which they apply across all subsidiaries, regardless of industry (from industrial products to banking). This system is a standardized playbook for continuous improvement, utilizing tools like Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma to relentlessly reduce waste and drive efficiency.

2.  **Structural Cost Advantage:** The **Steel Partners Purchasing Council** consolidates the buying power of all the different businesses, creating economies of scale that a smaller, independent competitor could not match. This centralized purchasing for materials, freight, insurance, and IT gives every subsidiary a structural cost advantage in its respective, often fragmented, market.

3.  **Differentiation from Competitors:** Unlike most competitors who are focused on a single industry and rely on product innovation or brand, SPLP’s advantage is organizational and financial, as they are essentially a collection of market-leading companies managed to superior operational metrics. While some competitors may have greater financial resources or name recognition, SPLP’s differentiation is the ability to acquire an asset, streamline its operations, and enhance its profitability through the proven SBS.

### **Pricing Power, Market Position, and Historical Growth**

4.  **Special Position/Pricing Power:** While the company operates in many competitive industries where pricing can be challenging, several subsidiaries occupy specialized, high-value niches. For instance, **HandyTube** is a premium manufacturer of seamless tubing for demanding environments, where performance and quality are critical, suggesting that its reputation and specialized product allows for stronger pricing relative to commodity producers.

5.  **Reason for Growth:** The company grew by adhering to a clear philosophy: acquiring good companies with simple business models that are often selling below their intrinsic value, and then using the SBS to create a continuous improvement culture and control costs. This focus on operational excellence and capital allocation, rather than risky R&D bets, is the engine of its long-term value creation.

### **Displacement Risk and Customer Relationships**

6.  **Displacement by More Capital:** While a company with more capital could certainly acquire one of SPLP's subsidiaries, displacing the entire holding company is more difficult because the moat is the intangible "parenting advantage." Simply throwing more money at a competitor will not automatically replicate the deep-seated, cross-company efficiency, cost controls, and continuous improvement culture of the Steel Business System.

7.  **Customer and Contract Stickiness:** Customer stickiness is high in key segments due to the mission-critical nature of the products and the integrated services offered. For example, a subsidiary providing sophisticated supply chain solutions or a **HandyTube** product used in a critical system often involves deep integration, which makes the cost and risk of switching to a new supplier (high switching costs) too great for the customer. This results in sticky, recurring relationships.

8.  **Network Effects and Investment in Moat:** The internal **Steel Partners Purchasing Council** is a form of an internal network effect, where the value of the shared resource (purchasing power) increases as more subsidiaries join the network. The company has secured its moat through this internal strategy, as well as by making strategic acquisitions that further benefit from this shared infrastructure.

9.  **R&D and Innovation Strategy:** The company does not rely on massive, frontier **product R&D** to maintain its edge. Instead, it heavily invests in **process innovation** by implementing the Steel Business System (Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing) to achieve superior operational efficiency and drive down costs, which is a constant requirement to stay competitive. Its edge is maintained by constantly innovating *how* it produces and operates, not necessarily *what* it produces.

## Catalyst Analysis

The analysis of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) catalysts is based on the company's recent financial reports, press releases, and its March 2025 Letter to Stakeholders, as the company delisted from the NYSE and deregistered with the SEC in April 2025.

### Near-Term Catalysts (6-12 Months)

1.  **Continued Operational Efficiency (The "Steel Business System" - SBS).** Management explicitly states the SBS is driving performance improvements through lean manufacturing, data analytics, and collaboration across business units. The continued realization of cost savings and efficiency gains will boost near-term profitability.
2.  **Full Synergy Capture from Steel Connect Acquisition.** The January 2025 completion of the Steel Connect acquisition, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary, is expected to fully contribute to the Supply Chain segment and realize significant cost savings by removing redundant management layers.
3.  **Ongoing Share and Preferred Unit Repurchases.** The company's consistent strategy of repurchasing both common and preferred units reduces the unit count, which may increase earnings per unit and signal management's belief that the units are undervalued.
4.  **Growth in Diversified Industrial and Financial Services Segments.** Recent earnings reports have shown revenue and profit increases in the Diversified Industrial and Financial Services segments, suggesting positive momentum that could continue to drive short-term results.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures to Enhance Value.** Management confirms the strategy involves "strategic acquisitions" of public and private companies, and potential divestitures, with the goal of creating value by removing management layers and streamlining operations. Successful execution of this capital allocation strategy is a long-term catalyst.
2.  **Investment Portfolio and Strategic Activism.** The company actively manages its investment portfolio and engages in strategic activism, as shown by its investment and proposals concerning DMC Global. Successful outcomes from these investments could unlock significant value.
3.  **Unlocking Value from Reduced Reporting Burden.** The voluntary NYSE delisting and SEC deregistration (completed in April 2025) will significantly lower administrative, legal, and financial costs, allowing management to focus more capital and time on core operations and value creation.
4.  **Strong Financial Structure and Low Leverage.** The company has been focused on prudent financial management, using cash flow to pay down debt and fund its pension, resulting in significantly lower total leverage (0.8x as of June 30, 2024), which provides flexibility for future strategic moves.

### Management's Strategy and Catalysts (as stated in recent stakeholder letters)

*   **Focus on Long-Term Value:** Management is "committed to our strategy of creating long-term value for our stakeholders" by focusing on operational excellence, strategic growth, and disciplined capital allocation.
*   **"Steel Business System" (SBS) is Core Strategy:** The "Steel Business System" is an instrumental strategy emphasizing lean manufacturing, continuous improvement, and data analytics to review profitability by plant, product, and customer, which is expected to "profitably grow the business in 2025 and beyond."
*   **Acquisition Rationale:** The strategy is to acquire entire public and private companies, integrate them, and "remove redundant management layers realizing substantial cost savings and creating value for our stakeholders."
*   **Capital Allocation:** Management highlights the use of cash flow to pay down debt, fund the pension, and "repurchase common and preferred units," underscoring a belief that the units are a worthwhile investment.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available information, including SEC proxy statement filings (DEF 14A), the management of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) appears to have a structure that strongly incentivizes them to act in the long-term interest of the unitholders.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

**1. High Insider Ownership**

*   **Significant Founder/Affiliate Ownership:** The primary affiliated entity, Steel Partners, Ltd. ("SPL"), beneficially owned a substantial portion of the LP Units, which indicates a very high degree of capital alignment between the management's key decision-makers and the unitholders.
*   **"Higher the Better" Principle Met:** This high level of affiliate and insider ownership, particularly by the group led by the Executive Chairman/founder, suggests that management’s personal wealth is intrinsically tied to the long-term appreciation of the company's equity value, aligning their interests with those of public shareholders.

**2. Compensation Structure: Strong Performance Alignment**

*   **"Management-as-Owners" Philosophy:** The company's compensation philosophy emphasizes a "pay-for-performance and management-as-owners philosophy," with the majority of the Named Executive Officers' (NEOs) total target compensation being variable and "at-risk."
*   **Long-Term Incentives (LTI) Tied to Shareholder Returns:** A key component of the LTI plan for executive compensation consists of **Market Stock Units (MSUs)** which vest only upon achieving a challenging **three-year Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**.
*   **High Performance Hurdle:** The payout target is set at 100% for delivering a 20% TSR over a three-year period, with the minimum vesting for MSUs being 0% if the TSR is below a certain negative threshold (e.g., -13.33%), which directly ties executive wealth creation to the absolute return experienced by all unitholders.
*   **Equity Value Participation for the Manager:** The structure includes "Incentive Units" granted to the Manager (a related party), which generally entitle the holder to share in **15% of the increase in the equity value** of the Company, providing a significant financial stake in overall enterprise value growth.

### Conclusion

Management has **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

The incentive structure strongly supports a conclusion of **alignment with shareholder interests** because:

*   **Substantial Skin in the Game:** The major beneficial owner is an affiliated entity, meaning the controlling interests and management have a significant, highly-concentrated capital stake in the company's success, which is the hallmark of a favorable shareholder alignment model.
*   **Pay-for-Performance Focus:** The core of the variable compensation is directly linked to **three-year Absolute TSR**, ensuring that executives can only receive a full payout if unitholders experience substantial long-term gains, making it difficult for management to line their own pockets without first creating significant value for public shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a technical analysis and recent price history for Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP), here is an analysis of its stock performance.

1.  **Current Price Compared to 52-Week Low**
    *   The current stock price of approximately **\$42.00 USD** is trading approximately **24.11%** above its 52-week low.
    *   The 52-week low was \$33.84, which the stock hit on April 11, 2025.

2.  **Trading Low Based on Technical Analysis**
    *   The overall technical consensus is currently a **"Hold."**
    *   While the stock is significantly above its 52-week low, it is trading above key long-term averages; its price is slightly above the **200-day moving average** (\$40.57), which often suggests a "Buy" signal.
    *   However, the stock is showing mixed signals on short-term and medium-term moving averages, with the 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages suggesting a potential "Sell."
    *   Other indicators, like the **RSI (14) at 48.43**, suggest a neutral position, as it is not near the overbought (70) or oversold (30) levels.

3.  **Explanation of Big Drops in Recent Months**
    *   A significant drop that established the 52-week low in April 2025 was directly related to the announcement of a **voluntary delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)**.
    *   Steel Partners Holdings L.P. announced its intention to delist from the NYSE and to move to the **OTCQX platform** to reduce financial and administrative costs, which can sometimes lead to short-term investor uncertainty and price decline.

4.  **Explanation of Strong Price Recovery Since the Drop**
    *   The stock has since rebounded strongly from its April low, gaining over 24% to the current price of around \$42.00, which suggests investors have re-evaluated the company post-delisting news.
    *   A contributing factor to the positive price action is the company's strong operational performance, highlighted by its **net income for the last quarter increasing by approximately 165%** from the preceding quarter.
    *   Fundamental analysis suggests the units may be significantly **undervalued**, with one analysis noting a P/E ratio around 3x earnings, which is considerably lower than a peer-blended fair multiple of around 11x.

## Long Thesis

Steel Partners Holdings is a disciplined company structured for long-term value creation. Its primary advantage is the 'Steel Business System,' an internal playbook that constantly cuts costs and improves efficiency across all its diverse businesses (industrial, supply chain, and financial services). Near-term unit price growth will be driven by the full realization of cost synergies from recently acquired subsidiaries and the aggressive reduction of the unit count through share repurchases. Over the long term, the high ownership stake held by management ensures they will continue to allocate capital prudently, buying undervalued companies and using the operational efficiency system to grow them. The recent move to reduce administrative overhead by delisting allows more capital to flow directly into strategic growth and debt reduction, ultimately closing the significant gap between the company's strong underlying business value and its current low unit price.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that the global industrial and manufacturing sectors remain reasonably stable, preventing major cyclical downturns from harming subsidiary earnings. We must also assume that management continues its historical pattern of making disciplined acquisitions, successfully integrating them using the Steel Business System, and not overpaying for growth. Finally, the cost savings realized from reducing the public reporting burden must be effectively reinvested into value-creating activities (debt reduction and strategic growth), leading to market recognition of the company's true intrinsic value.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and flaws in the bullish thesis for Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP), primarily focusing on the significant risks and negative implications of its recent strategic decisions and the reliance on its operational system.

## Critique of the Long Thesis (Flaws and Holes)

1.  **Delisting Severely Impairs Liquidity and Price Discovery:** The move to voluntarily delist from the NYSE and deregister from SEC reporting requirements to save administrative costs is a double-edged sword that severely harms investors. While the thesis focuses on cost savings, the market reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with the stock plunging upon the announcement, directly contradicting the idea of "closing the significant gap" between value and price.
2.  **Loss of Transparency Undermines Investor Confidence:** The shift to the OTCQX platform immediately suspends or terminates the obligation to file regular reports like Forms 10-K and 10-Q, reducing transparency and increasing informational risk for outside investors. This loss of public scrutiny challenges the assumption of "market recognition of the company's true intrinsic value" and could be perceived as management prioritizing privacy over minority unit-holder rights.
3.  **Reduced Unit Liquidity and Unit Repurchase Challenges:** The delisting creates a risk that there is "no assurance" brokers will continue to make a market for the units, potentially leading to lower trading volume and increased volatility, making it harder for investors to sell. Reduced liquidity works against the "aggressive reduction of the unit count through share repurchases" by making it more difficult for the company to buy back units efficiently at a fair price.
4.  **"Near-Term Synergies" May Be Overstated:** The bull case relies on "full realization of cost synergies from recently acquired subsidiaries." The most recent external acquisitions were in 2018, and the most recent major transaction was an internal consolidation (acquiring the remaining minority interest in Steel Connect in late 2024). This suggests the *major* synergy realization window from new, external acquisitions may have already passed, making "near-term" synergy-driven growth questionable.
5.  **Macroeconomic Risk to Diverse Segments:** The core assumption of a "reasonably stable" global industrial and manufacturing sector is optimistic. Given the company's diverse, cyclical businesses (industrial products, energy/oil & gas services, and supply chain management), a slowdown in any of these major, global, capital-intensive segments could severely impact aggregate subsidiary earnings, quickly eroding any efficiency gains from the "Steel Business System."

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP)

The voluntary NYSE delisting and deregistration from SEC reporting requirements introduces significant friction and risk for unit holders, transforming the investment into an opaque, illiquid security and making the core value proposition of the bull thesis unachievable.

1.  **Value Trap Through Illiquidity:** The move to the OTCQX platform diminishes the units' visibility and liquidity, which has already been met with a sharp negative stock price reaction. By ceasing regular public financial filings, the company reduces the incentive for new institutional investors to participate and removes the mechanism (public visibility and analyst coverage) needed for the market to truly "recognize" and close the valuation gap.
2.  **Incentive Misalignment and Capital Allocation Concerns:** While management's high ownership suggests alignment, the decision to prioritize minor administrative cost savings over the transparency and liquidity of public unit holders suggests a governance model primarily serving the controlling interest. The unit buyback program's effectiveness is hampered by the loss of a public trading venue, and the capital saved from delisting may not be efficiently deployed for "strategic growth" without external market discipline.
3.  **Operational System Effectiveness is Obscured:** The "Steel Business System" remains an internal, unverified playbook for outside investors, and its historical track record does not appear to have prevented a persistent disconnect between book value and unit price. Without mandatory quarterly and annual public reports (10-Q/10-K), it will be harder to independently verify the successful integration and synergy realization of their diverse, cyclically sensitive businesses.
4.  **Heightened Cyclical Risk Without Transparency:** The combination of exposure to cyclical sectors (industrial, energy) and reduced public disclosure leaves minority unit holders vulnerable to negative operational surprises. If a major cyclical downturn occurs, the lack of timely, detailed SEC filings will prevent investors from accurately assessing the depth of the damage and making timely decisions.

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive work you've done, the primary risk, the major catalyst, and the central question all revolve around the company's recent **delisting from the NYSE and deregistration from the SEC in 2025**.

The bull and bear cases are in direct conflict over whether the cost savings from this move will outweigh the loss of transparency and liquidity.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should investigate to resolve the core uncertainty:

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

1.  **Quantify the Liquidity Impact (The Bear Case Reality):**
    *   **Question:** Has the daily trading volume on the OTCQX platform meaningfully dropped compared to the NYSE, and how many institutional investors have officially sold their positions? A drastic drop in liquidity would confirm the bear case of impaired price discovery, making the stock's low P/E ratio an illiquidity trap rather than a value opportunity.
    *   **Action:** Search for the current average daily trading volume (ADTV) for SPLP on the OTCQX and compare it to the ADTV from the same period one year prior (when it was still on the NYSE).

2.  **Verify the Cost Savings and Reporting Standard (The Bull Case Proof):**
    *   **Question:** What is the specific, quantifiable annual cost savings from eliminating the NYSE listing fees and SEC compliance, and what level of financial disclosure are they *voluntarily* committing to on the OTCQX? The company announced that SEC filing obligations (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) are now suspended or terminated. The bull case hinges on these savings being significant.
    *   **Action:** Search for management's official estimate of the dollar amount saved annually from the deregistration. Then, look for the first **post-deregistration Stakeholder Letter or Voluntary Financial Report** to see the actual frequency and detail of their new disclosure.

3.  **Analyze the Preferred Unit Strategy (Specific Capital Allocation):**
    *   **Question:** How does the delisting affect the 6.0% Series A Preferred Units (SPLP-PRA or SPLPP), which are also now trading on the OTCQX? The preferred units mature in early 2026, and their upcoming redemption is a hard catalyst for capital allocation.
    *   **Action:** Determine the current trading price and yield-to-maturity (YTM) of the preferred units, as a deep discount would signal a market concern about the company's ability to redeem the preferred units in the less-transparent environment.

4.  **Scrutinize Management's Post-Delisting Communication (Governance Risk):**
    *   **Question:** Beyond the initial announcement, how has management addressed the severe governance and transparency concerns raised by the delisting? The decision could be seen as prioritizing the controlling shareholder's private interests over minority unit holders.
    *   **Action:** Search for transcripts or summaries of the first few stakeholder letters or press releases following the deregistration date (July 30, 2025) to assess the tone and substance of their commitment to minority shareholder value.

5.  **Re-Evaluate Capital Allocation in the New Context:**
    *   **Question:** Since the unit repurchase program is a core catalyst, how has the company's ability to execute repurchases been impacted by the lower liquidity and potentially wider bid/ask spreads on the OTCQX?
    *   **Action:** Look for recent announcements or commentary on the pace and price of unit repurchases in the quarters *after* the shift to the OTCQX. Lower volume could make the program less effective.
