## Business Summary

CBL & Associates Properties operates as a specialized landlord, known as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), that owns and manages a portfolio of large retail properties, primarily regional shopping malls and power centers, located mostly in smaller metropolitan areas across the United States. Its core business model is straightforward: the company generates nearly all its revenue by renting out commercial space under long-term leases to various retail businesses, including department stores, specialty shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The company's financial success relies on keeping these properties fully leased and ensuring they remain attractive destinations for middle-income shoppers in their respective regions.

---

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk for CBL is the continued financial instability and potential bankruptcies of its retail tenants. If large anchor stores or key specialty retailers vacate the properties, CBL loses immediate rental income and must spend capital to re-lease the space, often at lower rates. The major long-term risk is the fundamental structural shift in consumer behavior toward online shopping (e-commerce), often termed the 'retail apocalypse.' This trend poses an ongoing threat, especially to CBL's properties, which are often considered less desirable B- and C-class malls. This exact decline in physical retail demand and resulting vacancies contributed heavily to the company's recent bankruptcy reorganization. The current concern is that CBL must now invest substantial capital to successfully transform or repurpose its aging mall properties with non-retail tenants, such as housing or medical facilities, a costly and challenging endeavor necessary to maintain long-term relevance and earnings.

## Company History

This history of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. is structured to be jargon-free for a general audience.

---

### **A History of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL)**

#### **Part 1: The Founding and The Rise of the American Mall (1978 – Early 2000s)**

1.  **Founding Vision (The "Why"):** The company was founded in 1978 by Charles B. Lebovitz, with the initial goal to develop and manage regional shopping malls and community centers. The name "CBL" is based on the founder’s initials.
2.  **Early Focus:** The company focused its operations primarily in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States, recognizing opportunities in growing suburban and regional communities. Its first mall, Plaza del Sol in Del Rio, Texas, opened shortly after in 1979.
3.  **Tailwind: The Golden Age of Malls:** In its early decades, CBL benefited from the major "tailwinds" (favorable conditions) of American suburban expansion and a boom in consumer culture, where enclosed shopping malls became the dominant destination for retail, dining, and socializing.
4.  **Major Growth Strategy:** In 1993, CBL became a publicly traded company, known as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). This move provided a large amount of capital (money) that allowed the company to rapidly expand its portfolio through new developments and strategic acquisitions of other properties.
5.  **Acquisition Spree:** This period saw CBL significantly increase its footprint, most notably with a large 23-property acquisition in 2001, which helped solidify its position as one of the largest retail property owners in the country.

#### **Part 2: Navigating the Headwinds and The Changing Landscape (Mid-2000s – 2020)**

6.  **First Headwind: The Great Recession:** The company faced early signs of pressure during and after the 2008 financial crisis, as overall consumer spending decreased, putting strain on its tenants and making it harder for the company to manage its growing debt.
7.  **Major Headwind: The Retail Apocalypse:** Beginning around the 2010s, CBL dealt with the major "headwind" of the dramatic rise of e-commerce and online shopping. This shift, often called the "retail apocalypse," caused foot traffic to decline at many indoor malls.
8.  **The Anchor Problem:** A significant problem was the bankruptcy and closure of large department store "anchor" tenants (like Sears or J.C. Penney). When these major stores vacated, they left huge empty spaces in the malls and often triggered clauses that allowed other smaller tenants to break their leases or pay less rent.
9.  **Early Innovative Solution: Redevelopment:** CBL began a strategy to redefine its properties by embarking on a new era of redevelopment. This included buying back former anchor store locations and replacing them with in-demand tenants, often focusing on new retail concepts, popular dining, and entertainment options (like fitness centers and movie theaters).
10. **The Debt Problem:** Despite these efforts, the company had taken on a large amount of debt to fuel its earlier expansion. This high debt load became unmanageable as the value of its properties declined and a growing number of tenants struggled to pay rent.

#### **Part 3: Financial Crisis, Restructuring, and Current Strategy (2020 – Present)**

11. **Final Headwind: The Pandemic's Tipping Point:** The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 acted as a final, crushing "headwind." Store shutdowns and prolonged consumer absence caused a significant number of tenants to stop paying rent, which pushed the already debt-burdened company to the brink.
12. **The Chapter 11 Filing:** On November 1, 2020, CBL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This was not to shut down, but to legally implement a plan to reorganize and drastically reduce its debt load, which ultimately cut total debt and preferred obligations by over \$1.5 billion.
13. **Emergence as a Private Company:** CBL successfully emerged from bankruptcy in late 2021 as a private company, meaning its stock was no longer traded on the public stock exchange. The company’s ownership shifted largely to its former lenders and bondholders who agreed to exchange their debt for equity (ownership) in the reorganized company.
14. **Current Innovative Solution: Mixed-Use Transformation (What's Working):** CBL's key strategy today is the complete transformation of its properties into vibrant, mixed-use community hubs. This means adding uses beyond traditional retail, such as residential apartments, office spaces, and medical facilities, on unused land (like large parking lots) to increase property value and generate new traffic.
15. **The Present Goal:** The current goal is to stabilize and strengthen the company by actively improving tenant mix, driving occupancy rates up, and continuing to redevelop properties to be "experiential" destinations. The company is focused on managing its improved balance sheet to navigate the current economic uncertainties and maintain stability in the highly competitive retail real estate market.

## Moat Analysis

Based on the analysis of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.'s business model, history, and market position, here is an analysis of its competitive moat, broken down into simple points.

### The Competitive Moat of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.

The moat for CBL is primarily built on its **dominant local market position** in its specific geographical niche, coupled with the renewed financial health it gained from its bankruptcy restructuring.

#### 1. Market Niche and Geographic Focus (The Primary Differentiator)

*   **Focus on Secondary/Middle Markets:** CBL's portfolio consists mainly of "mid-tier" enclosed regional malls and open-air centers, often referred to as Class B or C properties, located in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States.
*   **Local Monopolies:** In many of these smaller or secondary markets, the CBL mall is the single **"market-dominant"** retail destination, meaning local shoppers often have no comparable regional alternative. This creates a defensible physical advantage, as a new, large competitor cannot easily acquire the same prime real estate.
*   **Difference from Competitors:** Larger, "Class A" mall operators like Simon Property Group focus on densely populated, affluent, or tourist-driven urban markets with luxury brands. CBL differentiates itself by focusing on the less-affluent, broader regional customer base in communities where a quality mid-tier mall is an essential local hub.

#### 2. Customer/Contract Stickiness and Pricing Power

*   **Recurring, Long-Term Revenue:** The business generates sticky, recurring revenue primarily through **long-term leasing agreements** with retail tenants, which typically have an average lease term of several years.
*   **Pricing Power from Local Dominance:** The company has demonstrated pricing power in its new leases, signing new comparable leases at a significant average rent increase. This power stems from the lack of a suitable, scaled alternative for retailers who wish to serve the entire trade area covered by the mall.
*   **Embedded Tenant Relationships:** CBL has established, long-standing relationships with a wide array of national and regional retailers, with its top tenants accounting for a substantial portion of its total revenues.

#### 3. Historical Growth Driver and Moat Fortification (Post-Bankruptcy)

*   **Historical Growth:** CBL grew into a major player by aggressively acquiring and developing shopping centers, especially in underserved secondary markets, establishing a large footprint before e-commerce truly disrupted the sector.
*   **The Post-Bankruptcy Reset:** The company's biggest vulnerability—its massive debt load—was largely eliminated by its Chapter 11 reorganization, which reduced its debt by approximately $1.7 billion. This financial "reset" is the reason for its current operational stability and is key to its revitalized moat.
*   **Strategic Redevelopment Expertise:** A core strategy is the **repositioning and redevelopment** of aging properties. This involves transforming vacant department store anchor spaces into non-retail uses like dining, entertainment (e.g., casinos), hotels, and even apartments, making the mall an experiential hub for the community.

#### 4. Vulnerability to Displacement and Innovation

*   **Displacement Risk by Capital:** A competitor with more capital cannot easily displace CBL's best properties because of their prime and often unique location in the local market. However, a major competitor could use superior capital to complete redevelopments faster and more lavishly, or acquire CBL's weaker, non-core assets. CBL's strategy of shedding non-core assets and acquiring "market-dominant" ones aims to mitigate this risk.
*   **No Traditional R&D or Technology Network Effects:** As a real estate company (REIT), CBL does not invest heavily in traditional research and development (R&D). Its "innovation" is tied to its expertise in **real estate and market strategy**, such as:
    *   **"Densification"** (using unused land/parking lots for non-retail developments).
    *   **Curating the Tenant Mix** to suit local demand and counter the rise of e-commerce.
*   **Need for Constant Innovation:** The company does have to **constantly innovate** by reinventing the mall experience itself to remain relevant. Its moat is not static; it requires continuous strategic reinvestment and property-specific redevelopment to replace lost tenants and drive foot traffic.

## Catalyst Analysis

The following is an analysis of the catalysts for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL), based on recent news, investor releases, and the company's stated strategy from recent earnings calls (Q2 2025, Q1 2025, Q4 2024).

### **Management's Stated Strategy (The Five Pillars)**

Management's strategy is centered on five key pillars to reduce risk, improve performance, and create value for shareholders in the near and long-term.

1.  **Portfolio Optimization:** The company is actively selling non-core and lower-yielding assets while using the proceeds to opportunistically acquire more stable, cash-flow-accretive properties to strengthen the overall portfolio quality.
2.  **Balance Sheet Strength:** A primary focus is on protecting and improving the balance sheet through significant debt reduction, with the goal of achieving a fully non-recourse debt structure and meeting future loan extension requirements through natural amortization.
3.  **Leasing and Operations:** Management is pursuing aggressive leasing to prioritize occupancy and rents, while also working to diversify the tenant mix by adding high-credit quality traffic drivers to their properties.
4.  **Capital Allocation:** The strategy includes maintaining a stable or growing regular dividend, utilizing special dividends when appropriate, and continuously evaluating share repurchases to return capital to shareholders.
5.  **Valuation:** Management explicitly views the stock as having a "Significant opportunity for valuation upside," noting an illustrative Net Asset Value (NAV) of more than \$47 per share, suggesting the company believes its current stock price is undervalued.

---

### **Catalysts for Stock Price Increase**

#### **Near-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Increased Dividend and Capital Returns:** The company recently announced a 12.5% increase in its regular quarterly cash dividend, which directly increases the shareholder payout and signals management's confidence in future cash flow.
2.  **Share Repurchase Program:** A \$25 million stock repurchase program is authorized, which can boost earnings per share (FFO per share) by reducing the number of outstanding shares.
3.  **Strong Leasing Momentum:** New comparable leases were executed at a significant increase in average rents (over 39% in Q2 2025), which points to strong demand for the company's available space and will eventually translate into higher Net Operating Income (NOI).
4.  **Accretive Acquisitions and Refinancing:** Strategic acquisitions of four dominant regional malls are expected to immediately boost free cash flow, and recent refinancing activity on property loans has successfully managed debt and improved interest terms.

#### **Long-Term Catalysts**

1.  **Debt Reduction and Lower Interest Expense:** Continuing the deleveraging process, including approximately \$90 million in annual natural debt amortization, is expected to reduce overall risk and lead to further increases in Funds From Operations (FFO) per share in 2026 due to lower interest costs.
2.  **Portfolio Quality and Redevelopment:** The ongoing strategy of disposing of non-core properties and reinvesting proceeds into the remaining market-dominant centers and mixed-use redevelopment projects is expected to increase the long-term quality and stability of the entire portfolio.
3.  **Future Special Dividends:** As a REIT, the company may be required to pay special dividends to maintain tax compliance if FFO and taxable income continue to grow, which was demonstrated by the \$0.80 per share special dividend paid in Q4 2024.
4.  **Closing the Valuation Gap:** Management's belief that the company's illustrative Net Asset Value (NAV) is significantly higher than the current stock price suggests that successful execution of the operating and debt-management strategies could lead to a substantial revaluation by the market.

## Management Record

The management of CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL) is best understood through the lens of its history as a family-led company that recently underwent a significant Chapter 11 restructuring.

### **I. CEO & Key Management Background and History**

3.  **Stability and Tenure:** The overall management team is described as seasoned and experienced, with an average tenure of 6.3 years.
4.  **No Recent Leadership Change:** Notably, the same core management team, including Stephen Lebovitz, has steered the company through its high-growth period, its downturn, and the subsequent financial restructuring process.

### **II. Track Record, Key Decisions, and Shareholder Value**

5.  **Pre-Crisis Growth & Acquisitions:** After becoming a REIT in 1993, the company generated significant growth, expanding its portfolio size, cash flows, and dividends through various large acquisitions.
6.  **Critical Decision: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy (2020-2021):** The defining event of the management's recent track record was the voluntary filing for Chapter 11 in November 2020, prompted by the "retail apocalypse," high debt load, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
7.  **Delivery on Restructuring Promise:** The management successfully executed a Noteholder Supported Plan of Reorganization, emerging from bankruptcy in November 2021. This process significantly strengthened the balance sheet by reducing total debt and preferred obligations by approximately \$1.7 billion.

## Management Incentive

Based on the corporate filings and the critical context of the company's financial history, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL).

### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

The management incentive structure is a mixed bag, showing modern governance features (performance-based pay and anti-hedging policies) but operating under the cloud of a failed pre-reorganization structure and low direct insider ownership. While the *compensation plan is designed* to align with shareholders through "at-risk" equity, the *actual skin-in-the-game* (insider ownership) appears low due to the bankruptcy, suggesting the primary incentive to act in shareholders' interest comes from future performance-based grants rather than deep personal equity holdings.

---

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors (Lower the Better for Alignment)**

*   **Historical Context:** CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2020 and successfully emerged in November 2021 [cite: 1, 2 (from previous searches)].
*   **Ownership Shift:** The Plan of Reorganization significantly altered the ownership, with the largest portion of new equity being distributed to former creditors (noteholders) in exchange for their debt, resulting in a low carry-over of original equity for former common stockholders and, implicitly, for management [cite: 4 (from previous searches)].
*   **Current State:** The vast majority of shares are held by institutional owners, many of whom were former creditors [cite: 1 (from previous searches)]. This indicates the direct beneficial ownership of the company by directors and executive officers as a group is likely small, meaning their financial interest is more tied to new equity grants than deep personal equity ownership.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

*   **Performance-Based Pay:** A substantial portion of the Named Executive Officers’ (NEOs) total compensation is classified as "at-risk" and performance-based, with approximately 84.0% for the CEO and 76.6% on average for the other NEOs [cite: 5 (from previous searches)]. This emphasis on variable pay is a strong governance feature aimed at aligning executive outcomes with company performance.
*   **Annual Incentive Plan (AIP):** The annual cash incentive is predominantly tied to performance against **Corporate Goals** (70% for the CEO, 60% for others), with a smaller portion tied to subjective **Individual Goals** (30% for the CEO, 40% for others) [cite: 9 (from previous searches)]. Payouts are variable, ranging from 0% to 150% of the target bonus [cite: 9 (from previous searches)].
*   **Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP):** Long-term awards primarily use Performance Stock Unit (PSU) grants, which are designed to serve the dual purpose of retaining the management team and creating direct alignment with sustained shareholder interests [cite: 1, 7 (from previous searches)]. The value of these awards is directly tied to the future stock price and achievement of performance metrics.
*   **Governance Safeguards:** The company maintains a policy that explicitly prohibits officers and directors from engaging in "hedging" transactions (e.g., short sales or derivative contracts) that would allow them to offset the economic risk of owning the company's stock. This is a positive measure that forces executives to share in the downside risk of share price performance.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of recent price data and technical indicators for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL), here is a summary of the stock's performance and key events.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock is currently trading around \$29.16 (as of October 7, 2025), with its 52-week range spanning from a low of \$21.10 to a high of \$33.53.
2.  **Position Relative to 52-Week Low:** CBL is approximately **38.20%** above its 52-week low of \$21.10.
3.  **Recent Stock Performance:** The stock has been on a strong upward trend in the medium term, with a **14.13% gain over the last three months** and a **25.20% gain over the last six months**.
4.  **Technical Analysis Signal:** Technical analysis suggests the stock may be currently trading high or facing resistance; some indicators point to a "Strong Sell" signal based on moving averages. Additionally, the stock holds sell signals from both short and long-term moving averages.
5.  **Reason for "Bigly" Gains (Financial Improvement):** A significant upward catalyst was the company's improved financial health, including reporting 7.5% growth in Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) for the second quarter of 2025, driven by lower interest expenses and a reduced share count due to buybacks.
6.  **Reason for "Bigly" Gains (Dividend Increase):** The company announced a **12.5% increase in its quarterly cash dividend** to \$0.45 per common share, which can attract income-focused investors and signals confidence from management.
7.  **Positive Corporate Activity:** CBL has been actively strengthening its portfolio by acquiring four dominant enclosed regional malls and executing a **\$25 million stock repurchase plan**, which helps support the stock price.
8.  **Recent Financing Activity:** In the beginning of October 2025, the company announced closing nearly **\$158 million in financing activity** across three separate transactions, which bolsters its capital structure.

## Long Thesis

CBL is a compelling 'comeback story' based on its dramatically improved financial health and a smart plan to reinvent its properties. The bull case argues that the company has solved its most critical problem: crippling debt. By slashing over a billion dollars in obligations through bankruptcy restructuring, CBL is now stable and generates strong free cash flow. This cash flow is immediately being used to reward new shareholders through stock buybacks and rising dividends (up 12.5% recently), which helps the stock price rise quickly. In the long term, the company benefits from having local monopolies—its malls are often the only major shopping destination in their smaller regional markets. Management is capitalizing on this by transforming these aging properties into vibrant, mixed-use 'suburban town centers.' This means adding apartments, medical offices, and entertainment venues on unused land to diversify income and drive new foot traffic. If this transformation is successful, the true value of the underlying real estate assets is significantly higher than the current stock price, suggesting substantial room for future growth and market revaluation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case depends on four key assumptions holding true: 1) Management must successfully execute the expensive, multi-year strategy of converting parking lots and empty anchor stores into apartments and non-retail venues, ensuring these projects are profitable and attract new customers. 2) The company must continue to operate effectively in its local monopoly positions, meaning no major new competition enters its secondary markets. 3) Existing retail tenants must remain financially stable, avoiding a renewed wave of major bankruptcies that would leave large sections of the malls vacant again. 4) The company must continue to successfully manage its debt, reducing interest costs year over year to boost shareholder cash flow.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and flaws in the bullish long thesis for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL), arguing that the company's financial stability relies heavily on financial engineering and debt restructuring rather than robust, sustained operational strength.

## Critique: Holes and Flaws in the Long Thesis

### 1. Flaw in the "Crippling Debt Solved" Assumption (Assumption 4)
*   **High Leverage Remains a Risk:** While CBL drastically reduced its debt by approximately \$1.7 billion through bankruptcy, the company remains highly levered, with a capital structure that has been described as 73% to 75% debt-funded. This high leverage is a key risk, especially when compared to better-performing retail REIT peers.
*   **Variable Rate Exposure and Refinancing Risk:** A significant portion of CBL's debt (34% to 41%) is floating-rate, which subjects the company to higher interest expenses if the Federal Reserve does not implement the anticipated rate cuts. The company has also had to secure one-year extensions on nearly \$1 billion in debt maturing.

### 2. Flaw in the "Successful Transformation" Assumption (Assumption 1)
*   **Redevelopment is Slow and Unproven:** The multi-year strategy to create "suburban town centers" is expensive and high-risk, and its ultimate long-term profitability is not yet proven on a widespread scale. Much of the completed redevelopment currently involves replacing former department stores with **value or discount retailers** (e.g., Nordstrom Rack, Burlington, Five Below) and entertainment venues, which may not fundamentally elevate the quality or drive the high rent growth needed for a massive asset revaluation.
*   **Weak Core Operational Growth:** Same-center Net Operating Income (NOI) growth has been minimal, with some recent quarters showing only marginal increases or even declines, suggesting the underlying business is not yet demonstrating a robust, sustained comeback based on operational performance. The growth in Funds From Operations (FFO) has been significantly aided by a lower share count (due to buybacks) and declining interest expenses, not just explosive property-level NOI growth.

### 3. Flaw in the "Local Monopolies" and Asset Quality Argument (Assumption 2)
*   **Low-Quality Asset Trap:** CBL's portfolio is concentrated in secondary and tertiary markets with lower-tier assets, often described as "mediocre malls." Their "local monopoly" status often exists because the market cannot support higher-quality competitors, placing an inherent, low ceiling on how much rents and tenant sales per square foot can grow.
*   **Declining Core Fundamentals:** Same-center tenant sales per square foot have recently declined year-over-year, and in some reporting periods, the average gross rent per square foot has also fallen, which undermines the narrative of revitalized, high-value real estate.

### 4. Flaw in the "Existing Tenants Stable" Assumption (Assumption 3)
*   **Ongoing Bankruptcy Impact:** The risk of major tenant instability has not been fully eliminated, as recent financial reports continue to cite **bankruptcy-related store closures** (e.g., Forever21, JoAnn, Party City) as a negative factor impacting mall occupancy. This suggests that CBL's core tenant base remains vulnerable to a future downturn or the continued shift of retail spending online.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (CBL)

The bear case argues that CBL is a debt-restructuring success story, not a fundamental real estate recovery story, and its valuation is artificially supported by financial engineering that masks ongoing weakness in its core mall operations.

1.  **High-Risk Capital Structure and Interest Rate Exposure:** CBL maintains a highly leveraged balance sheet that is disproportionately exposed to rising interest rates due to a significant portion of its debt being variable-rate. This creates substantial financial risk if anticipated rate cuts do not materialize or are delayed, diverting cash flow away from shareholder returns and toward debt service.

2.  **Asset Quality and Operational Lag:** The company's portfolio of secondary-market malls imposes a permanent headwind, as evidenced by tepid Same-Center NOI growth, a decline in tenant sales per square foot, and recent reductions in average rent per square foot in some periods. The underlying cash flow is being driven by debt reduction and share count reduction, not organic strength in the retail business.

3.  **Expensive, Slow-Moving Redevelopment Risk:** The plan to transform malls into mixed-use "town centers" is an expensive, multi-year gamble with significant execution risk. The current redevelopments are often value-focused, and the shift to high-value, non-retail uses (like apartments and medical offices) is proceeding too slowly to fundamentally change the company's trajectory before the next economic downturn strains its vulnerable retail tenant base.

4.  **Value Trap Based on Financial Engineering:** The stock's appearance of "strong free cash flow" and rising dividends is heavily reliant on a lower interest burden post-bankruptcy and a reduced share count, which can only be repeated so many times. The underlying decline in property-level fundamentals (occupancy and sales) indicates the potential for a long-term value contraction that will eventually overpower the short-term benefits of financial restructuring.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent, comprehensive analysis that clearly frames the bull and bear cases for CBL. The initial search on financial metrics has already confirmed and clarified several points of contention.

Based on the synthesis of your work and the first search results, here are the most important next steps for investigation, focusing on the company's operational success and long-term viability.

### **Important Next Steps and Unanswered Questions**

#### **1. Clarify and Verify Core Operational Performance**

*   **Same-Center NOI Trend:** While Q2 2025 Same-Center Net Operating Income (NOI) declined by 0.5% (and 1.4% for the six months), the long-term thesis hinges on stabilization and growth. Investigate the full-year 2025 and 2026 Same-Center NOI guidance to see if management is predicting a positive trend reversal or continued marginal decline, which is a key pillar of the bear case.
*   **Rental Rate Breakdown:** The analysis notes a strong 39% increase in average rents for *new* comparable leases, but a decline in *renewal* lease rents. Investigate the mix of upcoming lease maturities and the percentage of space dedicated to these respective categories (new vs. renewal) to project the net effect on revenue growth over the next 1-2 years.

#### **2. Substantiate the Mixed-Use Redevelopment Plan (The Core Catalyst)**

*   **Project Specifics and ROI:** The "mixed-use transformation" is the most critical long-term catalyst, yet the bear case suggests it is slow and unproven. Find a list of 3-5 specific, major redevelopment projects (e.g., adding apartments, medical, or office) and their estimated cost, expected completion date, and projected stabilized return on investment (ROI).
*   **Densification and Land Value:** Investigate the appraisal or assumed value of the *outparcel* (unused) land and how much of it is zoned for multi-family or non-retail use. This directly supports or refutes the long thesis's claim that the underlying real estate value is significantly higher than the current stock price.

#### **3. Quantify the Valuation Gap and NAV Calculation**

*   **NAV Assumptions and Cap Rates:** Management claims an illustrative Net Asset Value (NAV) of over \$47 per share. Search for the specific cap rate (capitalization rate) assumptions used by CBL or third-party analysts to arrive at this figure. A high NAV based on low cap rates is a red flag for the bear case, while a high NAV based on high cap rates would validate the bull case that the stock is deeply undervalued.

#### **4. Deeper Dive into Debt Maturity and Refinancing Risk**

*   **Upcoming Debt Wall:** The bear case mentions the need to secure one-year extensions on nearly \$1 billion in debt. Identify the exact maturity schedule of CBL’s non-recourse property-level debt over the next two to four years (2026–2029). This will determine the company's financial exposure to rising interest rates and refinance risk outside of the Fed's short-term rate-cut assumptions.
*   **Loan-to-Value (LTV) on Maturities:** Assess the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio on the next significant debt maturities. If the LTV is high on B- and C-class malls, it increases the risk that CBL may lose control of those properties (as they did with three malls post-bankruptcy).

***

### **Initial Search Check-In: What We Now Know**

*   **CBL is Public:** CBL successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization and its common stock, under the ticker **CBL**, re-listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in November 2021, directly contradicting the "Emergence as a Private Company" point in the history.
*   **High Leverage is Confirmed:** The company's capital structure is heavily debt-funded, reported as **73% to 75%** of enterprise value (as of Q1/Q2 2025), validating the bear case risk.
*   **Interest Rate Risk is Confirmed:** **34% to 41%** of CBL's total debt is floating-rate (variable-rate), confirming a significant financial tailwind from anticipated Fed rate cuts, but also a major risk if cuts are delayed.
*   **Operational Headwinds Persist:** Same-Center NOI was **down 0.5%** in Q2 2025 and **down 1.4%** for the first six months of 2025, primarily due to increased operating expenses. The strong FFO growth is primarily driven by lower interest expense and share count, not property-level NOI growth, strengthening the bear case.
*   **Tenant Sales Mixed:** Same-center tenant sales per square foot **increased 3.5%** in Q2 2025, a positive sign, but the 12-month trailing increase was only 0.8%, and the company cautioned the Q2 rise may be due to "tariff front-running."
