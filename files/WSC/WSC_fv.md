## 2. Business Engine and Revenue/Margin Projection (2025-2030)

### Business Engine Analysis

WillScot Mobile Mini's core business is leasing modular space and portable storage, driven by two primary factors:
1.  **Average Monthly Rental Rates (Rate):** This is the key driver of profitability. Management has successfully driven significant rate increases (e.g., Modular up 5.2% and Storage up 7.2% in Q2 2025).
2.  **Units on Rent (Volume):** This has been a headwind, with volumes declining due to contraction in key end markets and a slowdown in non-residential construction. Management stated they do **not expect a significant inflection in rental units for 2025**.
3.  **Value Added Products and Services (VAPS):** A structural growth opportunity, representing 17% of total revenue in Q2 2025, providing margin expansion and a turnkey solution.

The company's strategy is to offset volume weakness with Rate and VAPS growth, leading to resilient EBITDA margins (42-44% Adjusted EBITDA margin).

### Revenue Assumptions (2025-2030)

| Year | Revenue (in millions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification (Conservative Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | **$2,396** | N/A | Full-Year Reported |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | **$2,325** | -3.0% | Midpoint of $2.3B - $2.35B full-year guidance, reflecting the volume decline expected for the year. |
| **2026** | **$2,371** | 2.0% | Assumes volume stabilization and a more moderate pricing environment. VAPS and rate increases only drive 2.0% growth, reflecting a very conservative view of a persistent soft construction market. |
| **2027** | **$2,466** | 4.0% | Assumes an inflection point where unit volume marginally recovers, combined with moderate 4-5% annual rate/VAPS growth, still conservative given historical growth is much higher. |
| **2028** | **$2,565** | 4.0% | Continuation of modest structural growth driven by VAPS and price power in a mature market. |
| **2029** | **$2,668** | 4.0% | Continuation of modest structural growth. |
| **2030** | **$2,775** | 4.0% | Continuation of modest structural growth. |

### Margin and Expense Assumptions

The ultimate DCF uses **Net Income** as the cash flow proxy, per the rules. We must accurately model the path from Revenue to Net Income, which for WSC involves significant non-cash Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) and high Interest Expense due to its asset-heavy, leveraged structure.

*   **Gross Margin:** Use a conservative **50.0%**, slightly lower than the 2024 full-year (54.3%) and Q2 2025 (50.3%) to factor in future cost/labor pressure.
*   **Operating Expenses (excluding D&A):** Management reported a 44.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2024. This means Operating Expenses *excluding* D&A were $1,333M / $2,396M $\approx$ 55.6% of revenue. Since Operating Margin surged to 21.5% in Q2 2025, we will use an operating expense margin of **28.0%** (Selling, General & Administrative / Revenue) for a conservative Net Income projection, representing an expected operating leverage improvement over the long term, but still conservative.
*   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** The company is *highly* capital intensive. D&A is the key driver of the large gap between high Adjusted EBITDA/Free Cash Flow and low Net Income. We will model D&A conservatively at **20.0% of Revenue** for the entire forecast period, which is higher than the 2024 rate (approx. 16.3% of revenue, $391M D&A) to factor in higher net CapEx.
*   **Interest Expense:** Based on the latest debt and rates, the annual cash interest expense is estimated at **$218 million**. Given the current debt of $3.7B and the maturity being extended to 2030, we will assume the Interest Expense remains at a high, constant value of **$218 million per year** to be conservative.
*   **Tax Rate:** The company is becoming a partial taxpayer in 2025, with cash taxes expected to be $30M higher than 2024. For Net Income, we will use a conservative, long-term effective tax rate of **25.0%** on pre-tax income.

## 3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow Calculation

### Projected Net Income (as Cash Flow Proxy)

The valuation requires Net Income to flow to cash for the next year, which then earns an ROIC.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** 2024 ROIC was 16.7%. To be **conservative** as per the rules, we will use a stable, much lower **ROIC of 6.0%** on the accumulated retained Net Income (cash) from the prior year. This reflects the challenge of deploying capital at high returns in a soft market.

| Metric (in millions USD) | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Revenue** | **2,325** | **2,371** | **2,466** | **2,565** | **2,668** | **2,775** |
| Cost of Goods Sold (50%) | 1,163 | 1,186 | 1,233 | 1,283 | 1,334 | 1,388 |
| **Gross Profit (50%)** | 1,163 | 1,186 | 1,233 | 1,283 | 1,334 | 1,388 |
| OpEx ex. D&A (28%) | 651 | 664 | 691 | 718 | 747 | 777 |
| **Operating Profit ex. D&A** | 512 | 522 | 542 | 565 | 587 | 611 |
| D&A (20%) | 465 | 474 | 493 | 513 | 534 | 555 |
| **Operating Profit** | 47 | 48 | 49 | 52 | 53 | 56 |
| B. Interest Expense | 218 | 218 | 218 | 218 | 218 | 218 |
| C. ROIC on Prior Year Cash | 0 | 0.9 | 1.1 | 1.3 | 1.5 | 1.7 |
| **Pre-Tax Income (A-B+C)** | **-171** | **-169** | **-168** | **-165** | **-163** | **-161** |
| Tax (25% on positive PBT, 0 on neg.) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Net Income (Cash Flow)** | **-171** | **-169** | **-168** | **-165** | **-163** | **-161** |
| **Accumulated Cash** | **-171** | **-340** | **-508** | **-673** | **-836** | **-997** |
| ROIC for Next Year (6% on Acc. Cash) | -10.3 | -20.4 | -30.5 | -40.4 | -50.2 | -59.8 |

*Note: Interest/Taxes would have a non-cash component, but using the full Interest Expense in this simplified Net Income model is conservative and appropriate given the negative Pre-Tax Income.*

### Conservative Perpetual Growth Rate and Discount Rate

*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate):** Due to the company's cyclical exposure (construction), high leverage, and a conservative outlook, we use a very low, long-term rate.
    *   **Assumption:** **1.5%**
*   **Discount Rate (Cost of Equity):** Given the current risk profile, high leverage (Total Debt to Total Capital is 79.6%), and the need for a conservative estimate, a high discount rate is necessary.
    *   **Assumption:** **9.0%**

### Terminal Value and Net Present Value (NPV)

The projected Net Income is negative for the entire period. This is a critical finding based on the conservative modeling of interest expense and D&A.

**Terminal Value (TV)** in 2030 (using the 2030 Net Income of $-161M):

*   TV = [2030 Net Income * (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = [$-161M * (1 + 0.015)] / (0.09 - 0.015) = $-163.4M / 0.075 = **$-2,179 million**

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation (NPV):**

| Year | Cash Flow (Net Income) (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | -171 | 0.917 | -157 |
| **2026** | -169 | 0.842 | -142 |
| **2027** | -168 | 0.772 | -130 |
| **2028** | -165 | 0.708 | -117 |
| **2029** | -163 | 0.650 | -106 |
| **2030 (Net Income)** | -161 | 0.596 | -96 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | -2,179 | 0.596 | -1,299 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$-2,047 million** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The fair value is calculated using the formula:

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{(\text{Total Cash} + \text{NPV of Future Cash Flows}) - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{(\$13 \text{M} + (-\$2,047 \text{M})) - \$3,700 \text{M}}{182.08 \text{M Shares}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{-\$5,734 \text{M}}{182.08 \text{M}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \mathbf{-\$31.49 \text{ per share}}$$

### Fair Value Conclusion and Market Discrepancy

**Fair Value per Share: $-\$31.49**
**Current Market Price: $\approx \$22.47**

The valuation yields a deeply negative fair value, which is significantly distant from the current market price of $\approx \$22.47$. This implies that the market is making radically different assumptions about the company's future cash flows.

**Justification for Discrepancy and Market Assumptions**

The core reason for the negative valuation is the conservative DCF model's projection that **Net Income will remain negative** due to the company's high D&A and high Interest Expense, even with moderate revenue growth.

*   **Valuation Assumption (My Model):** The model strictly followed the rule to use **Net Income** as the cash flow proxy, which resulted in a negative value because the company's massive **Interest Expense (\$218M)** and large **D&A (\$465M+)** expenses systematically overwhelm its operating profit. The company is asset-heavy and highly leveraged, meaning Net Income is not a true reflection of deployable operational cash flow.
*   **Market Assumption (Implied by Current Price):** The market is likely valuing WSC based on **Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF)** or **EBITDA**, not Net Income.
    *   **Adjusted FCF:** Management guides for $\mathbf{\$525 \text{ million}}$ in Adjusted FCF for 2025. The market sees this as the true cash-generating ability, which can be used for debt reduction, acquisitions, and dividends. The negative Net Income is largely a non-cash accounting issue (D&A) plus the interest on the debt used to acquire those depreciating assets.
    *   **EBITDA:** Management guides for $\mathbf{\$1.01 \text{ billion}}$ in Adjusted EBITDA for 2025. If we assume a very conservative 10x EBITDA multiple on this value, the Enterprise Value would be \$10.1B. Subtracting Net Debt of \$3.687B would give an Equity Value of $\approx \$6.4 \text{B}$, or $\mathbf{\$35.15 \text{ per share}}$ (\$6.4B / 182.08M shares).

**Conclusion:**

My valuation's highly conservative methodology, which is required to use **Net Income** as the cash flow proxy, fails to capture the true economic value of WSC's business model. WillScot's high Adjusted EBITDA margin and strong Free Cash Flow generation are characteristics of a capital-intensive leasing business where **Depreciation & Amortization is a poor proxy for maintenance capital expenditures**.

The market is pricing the stock based on its high $\mathbf{Adjusted \text{ Free } Cash \text{ Flow}}$ (guided to \$525M) and $\mathbf{EBITDA}$ (\$1.01B), which represents the cash available after maintenance CapEx and interest, but before growth CapEx and acquisitions. This is a common and appropriate valuation method for asset-heavy leasing companies, which my Net Income model ignores. The market's implied valuation of approximately \$35 per share (based on a conservative 10x EBITDA) suggests the market expects moderate future growth and strong cash flow conversion to continue.
