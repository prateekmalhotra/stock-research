## Business Summary

The company, Bloomin' Brands, operates several major casual dining restaurant chains, most notably Outback Steakhouse, primarily serving customers across the United States. Its core business model is Business-to-Consumer (B2C), generating revenue by selling prepared meals and beverages in a sit-down environment. The vast majority of earnings come from these direct sales to middle-class and upper-middle-class patrons who view dining out as an affordable treat. The company relies on high foot traffic and managing efficient operations within its company-owned locations to drive profit, supplemented by franchising fees from international partners.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk involves high operating costs. As a major consumer of beef, labor, and energy, Bloomin' Brands is vulnerable to ongoing inflation, which squeezes profit margins if they cannot raise menu prices enough without deterring customers. This industry is highly sensitive to recessions; previous economic downturns (like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic) have severely harmed traffic and earnings when consumers cut back on discretionary dining. A critical long-term concern is intense competition from faster, tech-savvy alternatives (fast-casual restaurants and third-party delivery services). Failure to continuously invest in digital ordering technology and menu innovation could cause the company to lose market share, harming its long-term relevance and overall earnings position.

## Company History

Bloomin' Brands, Inc. is one of the world's largest casual dining restaurant companies, which you would know primarily through its famous chain, Outback Steakhouse. Its history is a story of starting with one brand and expanding into a portfolio of dining options.

***

### 1. Inception and Founding Goal (1988)

*   **Founding:** Bloomin' Brands was founded in August 1988 in Tampa, Florida, initially under the name Multi-Venture Partners, Inc.
*   **Founders and Goal:** Four friends and hospitality industry veterans—Chris Sullivan, Robert Basham, Tim Gannon, and Trudy Cooper—wanted to open a restaurant that offered high-quality steaks and a relaxed, fun atmosphere at a reasonable price.
*   **The Original Concept:** They chose an Australian theme for their first restaurant, Outback Steakhouse, to embody the laid-back, friendly, and approachable image they wanted, setting it apart from more traditional steakhouses.

### 2. Early Growth and Portfolio Diversification (1991–2000s)

*   **Initial Public Offering (IPO):** The company grew quickly and went public in 1991 under the name Outback Steakhouse, Inc., using the money raised from the stock market to fund its rapid expansion across the U.S.
*   **Multi-Brand Strategy:** The founders realized they could apply their successful operational model to other types of food, which became a core strategy to spread risk and capture more of the dining market.
*   **New Concepts:** This led to the launch of other restaurant concepts, including Carrabba’s Italian Grill in 1993, and later Bonefish Grill and the fine dining brand Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar in the late 1990s.

### 3. Corporate Shifts and Rebranding (2007–2012)

*   **Headwind: Quarterly Pressure:** In the mid-2000s, like many public companies, the business felt pressure to constantly deliver short-term results, which made long-term strategic investments difficult.
*   **Innovative Solution: Going Private:** In 2007, the company (then known as OSI Restaurant Partners) was bought out and taken private by investment firms. This allowed leadership to restructure and focus on improving the business without the immediate pressure of Wall Street's quarterly reports.
*   **The Rebrand:** The company was brought back to the public stock market in 2012, and officially renamed **Bloomin' Brands, Inc.** The new name, inspired by the iconic Bloomin' Onion appetizer, represented their shift from being a single steakhouse company to a portfolio of four distinct restaurant brands.

### 4. Modern Problems (Headwinds) and Digital Solutions (Tailwinds)

*   **Headwind: Industry Slump:** Around 2015, the casual dining sector faced market pressures, and the company experienced a decline in sales at some of its established restaurants, requiring a strategic shift to better connect with diners.
*   **Innovative Solution: Dine Rewards:** In response, they launched "Dine Rewards" in 2016, a cross-brand loyalty program that was a major industry innovation. This program lets customers earn rewards at one of the four main restaurants and use them at any of the others, encouraging diners to try their other concepts.
*   **Headwind: The COVID-19 Pandemic:** In 2020, the biggest challenge hit when forced closures effectively eliminated indoor dining, threatening the core business model of casual dining.
*   **Innovative Solution & Tailwinds:**
    *   **Off-Premise Advantage:** The company had previously invested in a strong **off-premises** (take-out and delivery) business, which was a massive tailwind during the pandemic. This infrastructure allowed them to quickly shift their focus and triple off-premises sales, keeping nearly all locations open.
    *   **Employee-First Policy:** Unlike many competitors, Bloomin' Brands did not terminate or furlough employees whose dining rooms were closed. Instead, they offered relief pay and free meals, which allowed them to quickly and easily reopen their dining rooms without the cost and time of rehiring and training.
    *   **Technology Acceleration:** They streamlined their digital operations, moving payment processes online for to-go orders and adopting new technologies like AI to improve forecasting, making the ordering process more efficient for both staff and customers.

### **The Company Today**

Bloomin' Brands is now focused on leveraging its digital success—especially the high volume of carry-out and delivery orders—while continuing to refine the in-restaurant experience at its four core brands: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar. Its goal remains true to its founders: to offer a variety of high-quality dining experiences, from casual to upscale, supported by a dedication to good service and smart operations.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN) is built less on proprietary secrets or patents and more on the scale and efficiency advantages that come from its multi-brand structure, which is difficult for a new entrant to replicate quickly.

### Key Differentiating Factors and Competitive Advantages

1.  **Unique Multi-Brand Loyalty Program (Customer Stickiness):** The **Dine Rewards** loyalty program is a key differentiator as it allows customers to earn and redeem rewards across four distinct restaurant concepts (Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar). This cross-brand structure encourages customers to stay within the Bloomin' Brands "ecosystem" for various dining needs—from casual steak to fine dining—making the business more sticky and recurring than a single-brand chain.

2.  **Shared Services and Scale Advantage (Internal Network Effect):** The company operates a consolidated structure where all brands share a central corporate and back-office platform. This "shared services" model manages functions like Finance, HR, IT, and Procurement across all locations, creating cost-effectiveness and scalability that a smaller chain cannot match. This scale also provides significant leverage in negotiating prices for food commodities, which is crucial in the restaurant business.

3.  **Advanced Supply Chain and Operational Efficiency:** Bloomin' Brands has invested in advanced technology for its global supply chain. This real-time, multi-party network allows the company to predict customer demand, collaborate with suppliers, and adjust logistics, which ultimately helps reduce food waste and lower purchasing costs for ingredients. This operational efficiency serves as a hard-to-copy internal competitive advantage.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Strong Position Across Multiple Dining Tiers:** The company holds a strong market position by catering to a broad range of consumers through its diverse portfolio, spanning from casual dining (Outback, Carrabba's) to polished casual (Bonefish Grill) and fine dining (Fleming's). This diversity allows it to capture different consumer spending levels.

2.  **Limited Pricing Power in Casual Segment:** While the premium concepts (Fleming's) may have some pricing power, the casual dining segment is highly competitive. Recent company commentary suggests its flagship brand, Outback, is priced higher than some rivals, requiring it to adjust its "value proposition" to drive traffic, indicating limited pricing power in the core casual market.

### Historical Growth and Displacement Risk

1.  **The Reason for Growth (Founder-Inspired Differentiation):** The company grew into a major player by establishing founder-inspired concepts like Outback Steakhouse that offered a differentiated product and experience within the casual dining segment. This early focus on distinct brand identities and quality execution laid the foundation for its subsequent multi-brand expansion.

2.  **Displacement by Capital is Difficult:** It is very difficult for a competitor with more capital to displace Bloomin' Brands quickly. While a new company can build restaurants, it would take a massive, sustained investment and time to build the equivalent level of **nationally recognized brand equity** and the existing **real estate footprint**.

3.  **Barrier from Scale and Regulation:** The restaurant industry trend favors large chain operators due to increasing complexity from menu labeling and labor regulations, which act as a high barrier to entry for independent or start-up chains. Bloomin' Brands' existing scale and compliance infrastructure provide a significant protective barrier.

### R&D, Innovation, and Moat-Building Efforts

1.  **Continuous Investment in Menu Innovation and Technology:** The company has an internal Research and Development (R&D) team that continuously tests and evolves its menu offerings to respond to consumer trends, which is a necessity in the food industry, not an optional edge.

2.  **Focus on Operational and Digital Innovation:** Bloomin' Brands continuously invests in technology beyond food, such as their new AI platform partnership to optimize commodity purchasing and a strong digital presence for online ordering, which drives higher sales and better margins from takeout and delivery. This focus on operational innovation and an efficient off-premise business model is a constant effort to strengthen the moat.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that might increase Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN) stock price in the near and long term, based on recent company communications and performance, are as follows:

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Successful Outback Steakhouse Turnaround:** The company's highest priority is the "urgent and deliberate work" on a turnaround strategy for its largest brand, Outback Steakhouse, which has been underperforming with declining comparable sales and traffic. Any signs of sales or traffic improvement at Outback, especially from new initiatives like menu simplification and better operational execution, would be a major catalyst.

2.  **Debt Reduction and Improved Leverage:** Management has prioritized reducing debt to get its lease-adjusted net leverage ratio below $3.0$ times. Using proceeds from the Brazil refranchising deal for debt paydown, along with healthy cash flow, could improve the company's financial profile and balance sheet health.

3.  **Inflation Normalization and Margin Improvement:** The company experienced pressure on its restaurant-level operating margins due to commodity and labor inflation, but expects commodity cost inflation to normalize in the back half of 2025. A stabilization or reduction in key inflation costs could lead to a faster recovery of margins than anticipated.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)

1.  **Sustained Growth from Other Brands:** Continued positive comparable sales growth from their polished casual and fine dining concepts like Carrabba’s Italian Grill and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar provides a steady, profitable foundation that is outperforming the casual dining industry average.

2.  **Increased Capital Returns to Shareholders:** Management's strategy explicitly includes returning capital to shareholders, which involves their quarterly dividend and potential share repurchases, although no buybacks have occurred recently. Clearing their debt leverage target would allow for more aggressive share buyback activity.

3.  **Positive Impact from Strategic and Leadership Changes:** The company recently announced new senior leadership appointments, including a new CFO-Elect and a new President for Bonefish Grill. The successful integration of these experienced executives and the completion of the "enterprisewide strategy" could drive sustained operational excellence across all brands.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy (from Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **CEO Mike Spanos** stated the company is committed to the Outback turnaround to deliver "sustainable and profitable growth" and that their priorities are "reinvesting back into our restaurants, reducing our debt leverage... and returning capital to our shareholders."
*   The strategy for the Outback turnaround focuses on "simplifying the agenda and driving consistency of execution to deliver a great guest experience." This includes simplifying menus and removing low-performing items.
*   Management mentioned that they are doing a "thorough assessment of our network of restaurants" and are committed to maintaining a lease-adjusted net leverage ratio below $3.0$ times.
*   They acknowledged that the turnaround "takes time" and are focused on building a high-capability team with an operational mindset.

### 1. Current CEO & Management Background

1.  **Current CEO's Extensive Experience:** Michael L. Spanos became the Chief Executive Officer in September 2024, bringing a background of over 25 years at PepsiCo in executive roles, including as CEO of a major international sector, and prior experience as an Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Delta Air Lines and CEO/President at Six Flags Entertainment.
2.  **Recent Executive Team Overhaul:** In August 2025, the company announced a series of senior leadership changes to build capability for the ongoing business turnaround, particularly at Outback Steakhouse.
3.  **New CFO Focus:** As part of the overhaul, Eric Christel joined as CFO-elect, bringing nearly two decades of financial leadership from the food and beverage sector, including PepsiCo and The Campbell's Company.
4.  **Strategic Turnaround Leadership:** Michael Healy, a 16-year company veteran, was moved from CFO to the newly created role of Executive Vice President of Strategy & Transformation to lead the turnaround efforts, prioritizing the Outback brand.

### 2. Management History and Key Changes

1.  **Former CEO's Tenure and Legacy:** David J. Deno served as CEO from April 2019 until his retirement in May 2024, having previously been the company's CFO since 2012.
2.  **Financial Stability in Crisis:** Deno's tenure is credited by the Board with strengthening the financial foundation through better profitability and a stronger balance sheet, a feat considered impressive given that nearly half of his time as CEO coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  **International Growth under Deno:** He was also recognized for optimizing Bloomin' Brands' international presence, particularly its highly successful business in Brazil.
4.  **Predecessor Change Driven by Activism:** Deno replaced Elizabeth Smith, who stepped down in March 2019; this change followed pressure from activist investor Barington Capital Group, which cited her "poor operating execution and poor strategic and capital allocation decisions" as a factor in the company's disappointing share performance.

### 3. Strategy, Vision, and Performance

1.  **Core Strategic Priority (Turnaround):** The central and multi-year priority under the new management is the **turnaround of the Outback Steakhouse brand**, which has seen a seven-quarter streak of negative same-store sales.
2.  **Operational Strategy for Turnaround:** Key initiatives include simplifying operations, streamlining menus (targeting a 15% reduction in items at Outback by year-end), and enhancing the guest experience through service model changes and technology.
3.  **Value and Quality Focus:** Management is employing a value-driven strategy, such as the "Aussie Three Course" offer, to attract price-sensitive diners, while also focusing on premium steak quality to differentiate the brand.
4.  **International and Brand Growth:** The long-term vision includes opening up to 60 new restaurants annually worldwide, with a strong focus on expansion in international markets like Brazil, China, Mexico, and South Korea, and continued growth for Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's.
5.  **Recent Performance and Challenges:** Despite progress on its turnaround, Q1 2025 results indicated the company is still navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment and losing market share compared to the casual dining industry.

### 4. Delivering Value to Shareholders

1.  **Capital Allocation Commitment:** A key component of the management's financial vision and shareholder value creation is maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
2.  **Historical Capital Return:** Under the previous leadership, the company actively returned capital, including a total of $160 million in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders in 2022.
3.  **Governance Structure:** The corporate governance program emphasizes creating long-term value for stakeholders and shareholders, with a Board of Directors consisting of ten members, nine of whom are independent.

## Management Incentive

The management incentive and compensation structure for Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN) exhibits a design that generally aligns the interests of its management with those of its shareholders. This is primarily achieved through a high proportion of performance-based pay and the use of relevant financial and operational metrics.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **High At-Risk Compensation:** The compensation structure for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is heavily weighted towards variable, at-risk pay, consisting of annual cash bonuses and long-term equity awards, rather than a high base salary. For instance, the former CEO's 2023 target cash bonus was 150% of his base salary, indicating that a significant portion of potential annual cash compensation is tied to company performance.

2.  **Performance-Based Annual Incentives (AIP):** The company’s 2023 Annual Performance-Based Cash Incentive Plan (AIP) was based on financial and operational metrics that directly impact short-term shareholder value. The key metrics were weighted equally at 50% each:
    *   **Relative Comparable Sales (50%):** This metric ties executive performance to the company's competitive standing against its industry peers.
    *   **Adjusted Operating Income (50%):** This metric links compensation to a core measure of company-wide profitability.

3.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Alignment:** A substantial portion of the executive compensation mix is comprised of Long-Term Incentive (LTI) equity grants, which typically include Performance-Based Share Units (PSUs). These are intended to reward sustained stock price performance and the achievement of multi-year strategic financial goals, such as Total Shareholder Return (TSR) or other long-term profit targets, directly connecting executive wealth to the long-term success of the stock.

4.  **Significant Insider and Director Ownership:** While an exact summary percentage of ownership by all managers and directors is not cited in the available snippets, public filings indicate a concentration of shares held by a few key individuals and firms, including those with board representation. This high degree of aligned ownership (higher is generally better) means a large portion of the management and directors' personal wealth is directly invested in the company's stock, reinforcing their incentive to grow shareholder value.

5.  **Stock Ownership Requirements:** Bloomin' Brands maintains stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers and directors, which mandate that they hold a multiple of their base salary or annual retainer in company stock. This requirement forces management to maintain a personal, financial stake in the long-term stock performance, strengthening alignment with shareholders.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

The overall structure indicates that Bloomin' Brands' management is **sufficiently incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**. The primary incentive drivers are:

1.  **Pay-for-Performance:** The heavy reliance on incentive compensation, particularly the high weight given to variable pay (bonus and equity), means executives cannot "line their pockets" without first delivering measurable financial results for shareholders (e.g., profitable growth and competitive sales performance).
2.  **Long-Term Focus:** The use of multi-year equity awards (LTI) that vest based on performance metrics (PSUs) encourages decision-making focused on sustained success rather than short-term gains, which is a key measure of alignment with long-term shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a review of recent price action and technical indicators for Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN), the parent company of Outback Steakhouse and other chains, the stock is currently trading significantly lower than its 52-week high and below key technical averages.

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is trading near the bottom of its 52-week range, with a 52-week low of $6.09 and a high of $17.57.

3.  **Technical Analysis—Trading Low:** According to key technical indicators (as of mid-September 2025), the stock is generally considered to be trading low and in a downtrend.
4.  **Moving Averages:** The price is trading below its key long-term moving averages, specifically the **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)** (around $8.20) and the **200-day SMA** (around $9.17), which are classic bearish technical signals.
5.  **Momentum Indicators:** The 14-day **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** was recently reported around 40.92, which is in the "Neutral" range and not yet in the "oversold" territory (below 30), but indicates a lack of strong buying momentum.

7.  **Reason for the Drop:** The major decline was driven by **disappointing forward guidance** and concerns over profitability, as the company reported declining restaurant-level operating margins due to **rising costs for labor and commodities**, and it dramatically **slashed its full-year earnings forecast**, even projecting a net loss for the upcoming quarter.
8.  **Long-Term Price History:** Over the last year, the stock has seen a major decline, decreasing by over **56%** due to sustained pressure on the restaurant sector and company-specific issues.

## Long Thesis

The stock is currently trading at deeply depressed levels, reflecting the market’s panic over high costs and the ongoing underperformance of Outback Steakhouse. The bull case rests on a swift, successful operational turnaround led by the new management team. Their main priority is fixing Outback by simplifying the menu and improving customer service, which should stabilize sales and traffic within the next year. This, combined with an expected drop in food and labor inflation, will cause profit margins to bounce back significantly, leading to higher earnings per share. In the long run, the company benefits from its reliable, growing secondary brands (like Carrabba's and Fleming's) and its powerful cross-brand loyalty program that keeps customers sticky. Once debt targets are cleared, the management will aggressively buy back shares at these low prices, acting as a major catalyst to push the stock price back toward its historical average.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The new management team must successfully execute the turnaround plan for Outback Steakhouse, halting the sales decline within the next 12 to 18 months. Commodity (food) and labor cost inflation must normalize, allowing operating margins to recover faster than market expectations. The U.S. economy must avoid a severe recession, ensuring that middle-class consumers continue to spend on discretionary dining. The company must follow through on its commitment to reduce debt and subsequently deploy significant capital into share repurchases at current depressed prices.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN) is flawed because it relies on optimistic timelines and assumptions for operational and macro-economic factors that are currently contradicted by the company's own performance, guidance, and financial structure.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **Flaw in Assumption 1: Swift and Successful Outback Turnaround**

1.  **Slow and Costly Turnaround:** The thesis assumes a "swift, successful operational turnaround," but recent performance indicates the progress is slow and the efforts are costing more than anticipated. In Q2 2025, Outback Steakhouse's same-store sales were still negative (-0.6%), and traffic was down, showing the brand is in the "early stages" of its multi-year turnaround, not on the verge of stabilization.
2.  **Reduced Financial Guidance:** The management's turnaround efforts have not yet translated to improved profitability, as the company was forced to lower its full-year adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting the incremental costs and continued macroeconomic headwinds, which directly contradicts the expectation of a quick sales and margin bounce-back.
3.  **High-Risk Operational Changes:** The critical service model change (reverting the server-to-table ratio from 1:6 back to 1:4) is explicitly intended to improve service quality, but it will simultaneously increase labor costs, placing further pressure on margins before the revenue stabilization is fully proven.

#### **Flaw in Assumption 2: Swift Margin Bounce-Back from Cost Normalization**

4.  **Persistent Inflation and Margin Compression:** The assumption that food and labor inflation will drop and cause a "significant" margin bounce-back is overly optimistic. In Q2 2025, the adjusted operating margin *contracted* significantly, driven by persistent labor inflation (around 4% expected) and commodity inflation.
5.  **Value Strategy is a Double-Edged Sword:** The "Aussie 3-Course" value strategy, while driving some traffic improvement, is a necessary measure to combat price sensitivity in the core demographic and likely contributes to margin compression. The company is actively introducing value, not raising prices, to offset costs, making a significant, organic margin bounce-back less likely in the near term.

#### **Flaw in Assumption 3: Reliable Secondary Brands and Major Share Repurchase Catalyst**

6.  **Unreliable Secondary Brand Growth:** The thesis overstates the reliability of secondary brands. While Carrabba's and Fleming's showed positive comparable sales in Q2 2025, Bonefish Grill's same-store sales declined significantly (-5.8%), and management has cited an inherent "risk in this brand," making the portfolio's growth drivers mixed, not reliably growing.
7.  **Share Repurchase Catalyst is Stalled by Debt:** The core catalyst of "aggressively" buying back shares is highly unlikely to materialize soon. The company has approximately $2.17 billion in debt, negative levered free cash flow, and management's stated priority is debt reduction. Crucially, there have been no share repurchases in 2025 despite a depressed stock price and existing authorization, indicating that capital is constrained and debt clearance is prioritized over a stock-boosting buyback.

#### **Flaw in Assumption 4: U.S. Economy Avoids Severe Recession**

8.  **Current Consumer Weakness is Already Factored:** The business is already grappling with a difficult macro environment. The guidance for negative U.S. comparable restaurant sales in Q2 2025 and the focus on value promotions reflect "consumer cautiousness and macroeconomic challenges," particularly among the middle-class segment that is a key demographic for Outback. This shows the company's performance is already being hampered by a weakened consumer, regardless of whether a full "severe recession" is declared.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (BLMN)**

The stock is a value trap due to a slow, capital-intensive, and high-risk operational turnaround for its flagship brand, Outback Steakhouse, combined with an overburdened balance sheet and persistent margin pressure from inflation and consumer weakness.

1.  **Protracted and Expensive Turnaround:** The essential recovery of Outback Steakhouse is not a "swift" fix; it is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort involving remodels and higher labor costs to address long-standing service and quality issues. The slow, sequential sales improvement is unlikely to justify the required investment and time, resulting in delayed financial benefits.
2.  **Structural Margin Compression:** Operating margins will remain suppressed because ongoing labor and commodity inflation is converging with a defensive value-pricing strategy ("Aussie 3-Course") required to combat a price-sensitive consumer. This squeeze prevents the anticipated "bounce back" in earnings per share, keeping investor sentiment low.
3.  **Capital Allocation Constraint:** Management's hands are tied by a high debt load and negative free cash flow, which has necessitated a dividend reduction and a complete halt to share repurchases. The key stock-price catalyst of aggressive buybacks is off the table until significant deleveraging occurs, likely preventing the stock from returning to its "historical average" valuation in the near to medium term.
4.  **Uncertain Portfolio Growth:** The combined performance of the secondary brands is undermined by the sharp decline and management-acknowledged risk at Bonefish Grill, offsetting positive results at Carrabba's and Fleming's, meaning the company cannot rely on a universally "growing secondary brand" story to pull the overall business out of its rut.
