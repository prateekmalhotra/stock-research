## Business Summary

FedEx Corporation operates as a global logistical backbone, linking businesses and consumers worldwide through an integrated network of air freight (FedEx Express) and road transport (FedEx Ground). Its primary customers are businesses of all sizes, ranging from small e-commerce sellers shipping individual parcels to large corporations requiring complex supply chain management, though rapid growth in online shopping has significantly increased its B2C volume. The core operation involves picking up packages, sorting them across vast distribution hubs, and ensuring timely delivery, deriving the vast majority of its revenue from the movement and tracking of parcels and heavier freight items across major global trade routes.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk is escalating operating costs, particularly driven by volatile jet fuel prices and increasing demands for higher labor compensation, which historically pressures FedEx’s profit margins unless price increases can be immediately passed to customers. A significant long-term threat is the heightened competition, notably the rapid expansion of competitor Amazon into third-party logistics, which challenges FedEx’s market share in the lucrative e-commerce segment and puts downward pressure on pricing. Geopolitical instability and trade wars also pose risks, as the Express division relies heavily on frictionless global trade; historically, economic slowdowns have immediately translated into reduced high-margin shipping volume, causing sudden drops in earnings that necessitate costly network adjustments. Furthermore, the massive capital required to maintain and upgrade its fleet and ground facilities makes the business vulnerable to interest rate changes and market downturns.

## Company History

The history of FedEx Corporation (FDX) is a story of a revolutionary idea that changed global commerce, followed by a continuous battle to adapt and innovate in the face of massive growth and fierce competition.

## The Inception and Core Goal (1970s)

1.  **The Founding Idea:** The concept for FedEx was born in a 1965 Yale term paper written by founder Frederick W. Smith, who argued that existing air freight systems were too slow and unreliable for the increasingly time-sensitive nature of modern business.

2.  **The Goal: Overnight, Reliable Delivery:** Smith’s vision was to create a system specifically designed to transport urgent packages like medicine, computer parts, and electronics reliably overnight. The mission was to be the delivery service of choice for modern businesses that needed speed and dependability.

3.  **The Groundbreaking Innovation (Hub-and-Spoke):** The solution was a revolutionary "hub-and-spoke" network; instead of shipping packages directly from one city to another (point-to-point), all packages would fly into a central location (the hub) overnight, be quickly sorted, and then immediately flown out to their final destinations.

4.  **The Launch:** Federal Express Corporation was founded in 1971, and operations officially began on April 17, 1973, when 14 small jets delivered just 186 packages to 25 U.S. cities. The company chose Memphis, Tennessee, as its central hub due to its ideal location in the U.S. and favorable weather conditions that rarely caused delays.

---

## Early Problems and Solutions (1970s - 1980s)

5.  **Headwind: Near-Bankruptcy:** The company struggled immensely in its first few years, with operational costs far outpacing revenue, bringing the company close to bankruptcy several times. In a famous story, Smith took the company's last $\$5,000$ to Las Vegas and won $\$27,000$ playing blackjack to cover a crucial fuel bill, buying a few more days to secure vital funding.

6.  **Tailwind: Deregulation:** A major boost came in 1977 when the U.S. Congress deregulated the air cargo industry, which allowed Federal Express to purchase larger aircraft, like the Boeing 727s, significantly increasing its capacity and efficiency.

7.  **Early Innovation: Digital Tracking:** Federal Express introduced one of the earliest electronic tracking systems, allowing staff to track packages and provide real-time updates to customers who called in, setting a new standard for customer service and reliability.

8.  **Rapid Growth:** The combination of the unique hub-and-spoke model and a growing demand for fast shipping allowed the company to become the first U.S. business to reach $\$1$ billion in revenue within 10 years of starting without mergers or acquisitions.

---

## Global Expansion and Digital Revolution (1990s - 2000s)

9.  **Global Growth and Branding:** In 1994, Federal Express shortened its name to the now-iconic "FedEx" and became one of the first transportation companies to offer online package tracking via its new website. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1978.

10. **Headwind: Competition and Diversification:** To compete with its primary rival, UPS, and to capture a larger share of the ground shipping market, FedEx acquired Caliber System Inc. in 1998, which included the Roadway Package System (RPS). This acquisition formed the basis for what would become **FedEx Ground** and was a key step toward diversifying beyond air express.

11. **Corporate Structure:** In 2000, the company formally reorganized and renamed itself FedEx Corporation, establishing its main business units as distinct subsidiaries (like FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight).

12. **Tailwind: The E-commerce Boom:** The massive and sustained rise of online shopping (e-commerce) became an enormous tailwind, creating unprecedented demand for ground residential delivery that FedEx Ground was strategically positioned to handle.

---

## Modern Challenges and Restructuring (2010s - Present)

13. **Headwind: International Integration Disaster:** In 2016, FedEx acquired European competitor TNT Express for $\$4.8$ billion to boost its presence in Europe. However, the integration was extremely difficult, plagued by integrating an aging IT system, cultural differences, and a major 2017 cyberattack that crippled TNT's operations and cost FedEx hundreds of millions of dollars, causing customers to leave.

14. **Headwind: Operational Redundancy:** The decentralized structure of having distinct operating companies (Express, Ground) became a major problem in the modern era, leading to costly redundancies, such as having separate FedEx Express and FedEx Ground trucks driving through the same neighborhood to deliver packages.

15. **Innovative Solution: The "One FedEx" Strategy:** In 2023, FedEx announced a massive, multi-year operational transformation called "One FedEx" and "Network 2.0." The plan is to consolidate the separate air and ground networks into a single, integrated network to eliminate duplicate infrastructure, reduce costs by billions, and become more efficient and flexible in the face of fluctuating market demand.

16. **Innovative Solution: FDX Digital Platform:** To compete directly with Amazon, which is increasingly dominating the logistics space, FedEx is evolving into a "digitally-led business." They announced the "fdx" data-driven platform, which offers e-commerce merchants end-to-end solutions like integrated parcel tracking, returns management, and delivery estimates, essentially turning their logistics service into a commerce partner.

17. **Current Goal and Legacy:** Today, FedEx remains a global leader in transportation and logistics, operating in over 220 countries and territories. Its goal continues to be leading the world with the "smartest logistics network" by constantly digitizing its vast physical network and driving cost-efficiency through integration, ensuring it can handle anything from an urgent overnight shipment to a high-volume e-commerce delivery.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of FedEx Corporation (FDX) is built on massive, hard-to-replicate physical infrastructure, powerful network effects, and strategic operational advantages developed over decades.

### Moat Components: The Foundation of FedEx's Advantage

1.  **Massive Scale and Capital Barrier:** The sheer size of FedEx’s global network—including the world's largest all-cargo air fleet, millions of ground vehicles, and thousands of operating facilities across 220+ countries—creates an enormous barrier to entry. A competitor would need tens of billions of dollars and decades to build a comparable physical network and infrastructure from scratch, which is why it is difficult to displace even with more capital.
2.  **Network Effects:** As more customers (businesses and consumers) and shipping destinations join the FedEx network, the value of the service increases for *every other user*. For example, adding a new city to the route network benefits all businesses that ship to that city. This creates a powerful self-reinforcing loop that attracts more volume.
3.  **Efficient Scale:** The logistics and express delivery industry is one where only a few major players can operate profitably and efficiently on a global scale. FedEx's massive daily volume and scale allow it to spread its high fixed costs (like aircraft maintenance and distribution centers) across many packages, leading to lower per-package costs than a smaller competitor could achieve.

### Differentiation and Market Position

1.  **Pioneering and Dominant Air Express:** FedEx was founded to revolutionize overnight, time-definite shipping, giving it a legacy and leadership position in the high-margin, critical express air cargo market. This focus on speed is a key differentiator, especially for high-value or time-sensitive shipments like medical supplies.
2.  **Unique Operating Structure (Non-Union Advantage):** Unlike its main competitor, UPS, FedEx Express and Ground operations largely use non-unionized labor. This structure provides greater flexibility in managing labor costs, implementing new technologies, and adapting operations to changes in the market.
3.  **Comprehensive Service Portfolio:** FedEx offers a portfolio of distinct services (Express for air and international, Ground for domestic package delivery, and Freight for heavy shipments) that allow it to offer a complete, integrated solution to large corporate clients.
4.  **Pricing Power in Niche Markets:** The company has strong pricing power, particularly in its time-sensitive and premium express services, where customers are willing to pay a premium for guaranteed speed and reliability. This is also seen through its ability to regularly implement general rate increases and various surcharges.

### Customer Stickiness, Contracts, and Growth

1.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** A significant portion of FedEx's revenue comes from long-term, high-volume contracts with large retailers, e-commerce giants, and manufacturers. These customers become dependent on FedEx's deeply integrated systems, which makes switching to a competitor extremely costly, time-consuming, and risky.
2.  **The Original Reason for Growth:** FedEx grew into a global powerhouse because its founder, Fred Smith, had the visionary idea to create a centrally coordinated, integrated network capable of providing reliable, **overnight, time-definite delivery**, something that did not exist before and was desperately needed by businesses.
3.  **"One FedEx" and Customer Focus:** The company is currently working on the "One FedEx" and **DRIVE** initiatives to simplify and consolidate its different operating platforms (Express, Ground, Freight) into a single, cohesive network. This will make it easier for customers, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to do business with them, further increasing loyalty and reducing friction that might prompt customers to look elsewhere.

### Innovation and Moat Reinforcement

1.  **Investment in Technology and Automation:** FedEx continually invests in technology, automation, and digital tools—like its **Network 2.0** initiative—to increase efficiency and reduce its operating costs. This focus on innovation and efficiency is necessary not just for having an edge but for maintaining competitiveness against major rivals like UPS and Amazon, which are also constantly investing.
2.  **Operational Transformation:** The current strategic initiatives, like Network 2.0, are essentially an internal overhaul designed to merge the separate Express and Ground delivery systems, a major move to realize billions in cost savings and create a more efficient, unified delivery network for the long term. This strategic innovation is how the company plans to future-proof its moat.

---

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for FedEx Corporation (FDX) stock price increase in the near and long term are primarily driven by its ongoing structural transformation and cost-saving initiatives.

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 12–18 Months)

1.  **Execution of the DRIVE Program:** Management consistently highlights the comprehensive DRIVE cost-reduction program, which is on track to achieve over \$4 billion in annualized structural cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2025. Successful realization of these cost savings will directly improve profit margins and earnings per share, regardless of the overall demand environment.

2.  **Spin-off of FedEx Freight:** The company's plan to separate its less-than-truckload division, FedEx Freight, into an independent, publicly traded company is intended to unlock value for shareholders. Management states this move will allow both the remaining core business and the new Freight entity to enhance focus and competitiveness.

3.  **Capital Discipline and Shareholder Returns:** FedEx has lowered its capital spending target and is committed to an aggressive share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in its free cash flow generation. Management repeatedly points to the focus on improving Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and returning significant capital to stockholders as a priority.

4.  **Domestic Volume Growth and Yield Management:** Continued strength in U.S. domestic package volumes and the ability to maintain pricing discipline (yield quality) are driving profit growth in the FedEx Ground segment. Management states it is focused on profitable share growth and effective yield management to offset market weakness in other areas.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Full Realization of Network 2.0 and One FedEx:** The full consolidation of FedEx Express, Ground, and Services into a unified structure, referred to as "One FedEx" and enabled by the Network 2.0 strategy, is designed to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. This initiative is expected to generate an additional \$2 billion in value by fiscal year 2027 by consolidating facilities, optimizing routes, and modernizing infrastructure.

2.  **Structural Business Model Transformation:** Management views the DRIVE program as having evolved into a new, data and technology-driven business architecture that is changing how the company operates across the entire enterprise. This is a critical component of the strategy to achieve a long-term adjusted operating margin of $100 billion.

3.  **Operating Leverage in Express:** The transformation of the Federal Express (Express) business, including air network optimization and aligning capacity with demand, aims to build operational leverage. Management emphasizes that this effort is intended to unlock the full profit potential of the core Express business.

4.  **Sustained Revenue Growth with Margin Expansion:** The combined effect of structural cost reductions from DRIVE and the network efficiencies from Network 2.0 is expected to position the company for sustainable adjusted EPS growth, with management projecting revenue growth in the 4% to 6% range in the near future.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of FedEx Corporation's (FDX) management incentive and compensation structure, based on its recent DEF 14A proxy statements, indicates a strong alignment with shareholder interests through significant insider ownership and a pay-for-performance model.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **High Stock Ownership Goals:** Executive officers have mandated stock ownership goals that require them to hold shares valued at a multiple of their annual base salary: 6x for the President/CEO and 3x for other executive officers.
2.  **Compliance with Goals:** As of the latest disclosure, each named executive officer meets or is on track to meet their ownership goal, signaling a personal financial stake in the company's stock price appreciation.
3.  **Founder-Driven Alignment (Historical/Current):** The former Executive Chairman (Founder Frederick W. Smith, now deceased) had an extremely high level of ownership, holding unpledged shares valued at over 786 times his required ownership goal, which historically ensured management's interests were closely tied to those of stockholders.
4.  **Director Requirements:** Non-management directors are also required to own a mandatory amount of FedEx stock, further aligning their oversight and decision-making with long-term shareholder returns.

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

1.  **Emphasis on At-Risk Pay:** A significant majority of the CEO's and Named Executive Officers' target total direct compensation is "at-risk" and performance-based (variable pay), with fixed base salary making up only 29% for the CEO.
2.  **Pay-for-Performance Functionality:** The compensation system is demonstrably effective, as Long-Term Incentive (LTI) payouts for a recent three-year cycle were below target due to a decline in adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS), confirming the system responds directly to lagging financial results.
3.  **Key LTI Performance Metrics (Long-Term Value):** The current LTI plan (three-year cycles) focuses heavily on shareholder value creation through a blend of financial and market metrics:
    *   **Adjusted EPS (50% weighting):** This is the most heavily weighted metric, emphasizing core profitability and its strong correlation with long-term stock price appreciation.
    *   **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (25% weighting):** This directly links a portion of the executive's pay to FedEx's stock performance compared to a relevant market index (e.g., the S&P 500), ensuring they are rewarded for *outperforming* the market.
    *   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) (25% weighting):** For recent LTI cycles, the company shifted to ROIC, which is a key metric for measuring management's efficiency in deploying capital to generate sustainable returns.

### **Governance and Risk Mitigation**

1.  **Robust Clawback Policy:** FedEx has established two separate clawback policies, allowing the company to recoup incentive compensation payments in certain circumstances, which helps mitigate risk and deters misconduct.
2.  **No Hedging or Pledging Policy:** The company maintains a policy that prohibits executive officers and directors from engaging in hedging or pledging transactions of FedEx stock, which ensures their stock holdings remain exposed to the same market risks as other shareholders.
3.  **Strong Stockholder Say-on-Pay Support:** The advisory vote on executive compensation ("say-on-pay") consistently receives strong support from stockholders, with 90.6% approval in the most recent vote, suggesting general shareholder satisfaction with the structure.

### **Conclusion**

**Management at FedEx Corporation is primarily incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders.** The compensation structure is clearly designed to drive long-term shareholder value: a large portion of pay is tied to objective financial (Adjusted EPS, ROIC) and market (Relative TSR) performance, and their significant personal stock ownership (both held and required) further aligns their wealth directly with the company's stock performance. The mechanism's effectiveness is proven by payouts being appropriately reduced when performance targets are missed.

The following is an analysis of the price history and technical outlook for FedEx Corporation (FDX) based on recent financial data and technical analysis signals as of late September 2025.

1.  **Current Price Relative to 52-Week Low:**
    *   Using an approximate recent closing price of **\$237.82** and a 52-week low of **\$194.30**, FedEx Corporation is currently trading approximately **22.39\%** above its 52-week low.
2.  **Technical Analysis Assessment (Trading Low?):**
    *   The stock is trading roughly in the **middle of its 52-week range** (between a low of \$194.30 and a high of \$308.53).
    *   Technical indicators present a mixed picture: Some analyses show a "Strong Buy" based on bullish signals from its 5-day, 10-day, and 50-day moving averages.
    *   Conversely, other long-term technical views suggest the stock has a **negative long-term trend** and is currently trading below its 200-day simple moving average, which is typically a bearish sign.

3.  **Recent Price Movement: Big Upward Surge**
    *   The stock experienced a significant price surge, with shares jumping over **5-7\%** in mid-September 2025.
    *   This upward movement was a direct result of the company reporting **strong first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings** that comfortably beat Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS).

4.  **Explanation for the Big Earnings Beat and Stock Rally:**
    *   The primary driver of the beat was the effectiveness of FedEx's ongoing **structural cost-cutting and efficiency program** (known as DRIVE), which helped expand operational margins.
    *   The company also saw **stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. domestic package volumes**, which helped offset some continued weakness in the international market.
    *   Investor sentiment was further bolstered by management's decision to **re-instate its full-year 2026 guidance**, signaling greater confidence in its business outlook despite global trade uncertainties.

## Long Thesis

FedEx is undergoing a multi-year, strategic revolution designed to dramatically increase its long-term profitability. In the short term, the company is successfully implementing the 'DRIVE' cost-reduction program, which is already delivering billions in savings by eliminating wasteful spending and tightening operations, directly resulting in higher profit margins and stronger earnings. For the long term, the core bullish catalyst is the complex effort to merge the separate air (Express) and road (Ground) delivery networks into one seamless, unified system ('One FedEx'). This consolidation will eliminate costly duplicate routes and facilities across North America, creating a hyper-efficient network (Network 2.0) that is highly flexible and scalable. This structural efficiency will allow FedEx to sustainably grow its profits faster than its revenue, leading to significant value unlocking—further boosted by plans to separate the high-performing FedEx Freight division.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that management successfully executes the highly complex, multi-year internal transformation (DRIVE and Network 2.0) without major operational failures or integration delays. We must assume that current cost savings are structural and sustainable, permanently increasing margins, and that the company maintains its pricing power and ability to effectively manage labor and fuel expenses. Finally, the thesis assumes that while competition remains intense, FedEx's global network scale and specialization in air express prevent major market share loss to rivals like Amazon or UPS, allowing volume growth to return as global trade stabilizes.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the key flaws and holes in the bull case thesis for FedEx Corporation (FDX).

***

## Critique and Flaws in the FedEx Bull Thesis (Bear Case)

### 1. High Execution Risk and Operational Complexity of Network Integration

The core catalyst, merging the Express and Ground networks into 'One FedEx' (Network 2.0), represents an extremely complex, multi-year internal transformation with significant execution risk.

*   **Risk of Service Disruption and Customer Loss:** Merging two distinct operational systems—the time-definite, high-service Express network and the contractor-based, flexible Ground network—is a massive undertaking that could lead to temporary service quality disruptions, which may drive customers to competitors like UPS.
*   **Unionization Risk and Labor Costs:** Consolidating the networks, particularly integrating the Express (Railway Labor Act) and Ground (National Labor Relations Act) workforces, significantly increases the long-term risk of large-scale unionization, which could negate cost savings by introducing a substantial (estimated 30%) labor cost premium.
*   **Cultural and Operational Clash:** The company faces an internal hurdle in aligning the distinct corporate cultures and operational practices of the two divisions, hindering the seamless realization of expected synergies.

### 2. Lack of Revenue Growth and Over-Reliance on Cost Cutting

The thesis over-emphasizes cost savings while downplaying the weak macroeconomic environment and pressure on the top line, making the long-term profitability reliant on a recovery that is not guaranteed.

*   **Cost Cuts Masking Revenue Weakness:** The billions in savings from the DRIVE program, while successful, are largely offsetting persistent revenue struggles and weak demand, which has led to downward revisions of fiscal-year EPS guidance.
*   **Non-Structural Costs:** The "billions in savings" are partially an "illusion of success" because the company has achieved these through non-GAAP earnings metrics that exclude substantial, multi-year restructuring and severance costs (which totaled up to \$2.0 billion by fiscal 2025).
*   **Softness in High-Margin Freight:** The assumption of sustainable volume growth is contradicted by recent results showing a slump in revenue and a decline in operating income for the high-performing FedEx Freight division, signaling underlying weakness in the B2B and industrial sectors.

### 3. Intense Competitive Headwinds from Amazon and Others

The assumption that FedEx's scale and specialization will prevent major market share loss is flawed, given the recent aggressive expansion by its primary competitors.

*   **Amazon's Scale Dominance:** Amazon has not only surpassed both FedEx and UPS in U.S. parcel volume but is aggressively expanding its third-party logistics offering ("Amazon Shipping"), which directly competes with FedEx Ground for commercial customers and threatens to commoditize the market.
*   **Loss of Pricing Power:** The intense competition, coupled with macroeconomic headwinds, pressures the industry toward price competition, challenging the assumption that FedEx will maintain its pricing power in the domestic parcel market.

### 4. Risks Associated with the FedEx Freight Spin-off

The plan to separate the "high-performing" FedEx Freight division carries risks beyond simple value unlocking, particularly concerning the timing and underlying health of the unit.

*   **Spin-off Value Under Pressure:** The planned separation of FedEx Freight is occurring while the division is showing significant weakness, with an 11% revenue decline in a recent quarter, meaning the spun-off entity's initial public valuation may be lower than anticipated, potentially diluting the intended shareholder value unlock.
*   **Loss of a Diversified Buffer:** Separating Freight removes a high-margin, counter-cyclical division that previously served as a stable buffer to the volatile parcel business, making the remaining core FedEx parcel business more susceptible to future macro downturns.

---

## Next Steps

This is a comprehensive analysis that clearly articulates the bullish case (execution risk and cost-cutting) and the bearish counterarguments (revenue weakness, Amazon competition, and operational risk). The next steps should focus on quantifying the greatest risks and validating the most aggressive targets.

Here are the important questions and next steps to investigate further:

### Next Steps to Investigate

1.  **Quantify Amazon’s Parcel Volume and Market Share Shift**
    *   **Question:** What are the most recent (last 12–18 months) published estimates for U.S. domestic parcel volume and market share for FedEx, UPS, and Amazon Logistics?
    *   **Action:** Search for analyst reports (e.g., from ShipMatrix, Morgan Stanley, or other industry trackers) that specifically compare **Amazon's parcel volume/market share** to FedEx and UPS in the U.S. to confirm the bear-case claim that Amazon has surpassed FedEx's volume and is aggressively taking commercial share.

2.  **Evaluate Risk of Unionization and Labor Cost Impact**
    *   **Question:** Are there any recent public reports, NLRB filings, or news articles detailing new union organizing efforts at **FedEx Ground** or **FedEx Express**, particularly in the context of the Network 2.0 integration?
    *   **Action:** Search for "FedEx Ground unionization efforts NLRB" and "FedEx Express union vote" to assess the probability and immediacy of the long-term unionization risk that could destroy the projected cost savings.

3.  **Validate the Long-Term Operating Margin Target**
    *   **Question:** What is the current analyst consensus on the achievability of the **10% adjusted operating margin target by fiscal year 2027**?
    *   **Action:** Search for recent analyst models or commentary that explicitly address the 10% margin goal in light of the \$1 billion tariff headwind and the Network 2.0 execution risk, determining if the street views the target as still credible.

4.  **Assess Service Disruption Risk (The Bear Case Execution Flaw)**
    *   **Question:** Has there been a measurable impact on **delivery times and service reliability** in markets where the Network 2.0 consolidation (merging Express and Ground stations) has been fully implemented?
    *   **Action:** Look for recent customer or industry reports (e.g., parcel audit firm data) that track FedEx Express and Ground service levels (on-time delivery) in the merged markets (e.g., Canada, or the 290 merged U.S. facilities) to identify any "temporary service quality disruptions" mentioned in the bear case.

5.  **Analyze the Freight Spin-off Timing and Valuation**
    *   **Question:** Given the recent weakness in the FedEx Freight division's revenue, how is its **standalone valuation of \$30–\$35 billion** holding up, and is the planned June 2026 spin-off date firm despite the soft industrial demand?
    *   **Action:** Search for recent commentary from the financial advisors (Goldman Sachs) or the LTL peer group (Old Dominion Freight Line, XPO) that addresses the market's view on LTL segment valuation and the specific risks to the Freight spin-off.
