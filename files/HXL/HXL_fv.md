### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Hexcel's business is predominantly driven by the **Commercial Aerospace** market, which accounted for approximately **63% of 2024 net sales**. The remaining revenue comes from **Space & Defense (30%)** and **Industrial (7%)**.

The core business engine assumption for this valuation is the sustained, multi-year production rate recovery and ramp-up in the Commercial Aerospace sector, specifically for key programs like the **Airbus A320neo and A350, and Boeing 787**. Management's commentary points to considerable backlog demand driving future growth.

**Revenue Model Assumptions:**

| Segment | 2025 Base/Driver | 2026 - 2027 Growth | 2028 - 2030 Growth (Maturity) | Justification/Engine Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commercial Aerospace** (63% of 2024 Sales) | **+10.0%** (Management Guidance) | **+8.0%** | **+5.0%** | *Ramp-up:* Reflects management's expectation for 2025 and a conservative continuation of the build-rate increase and increasing composite content on newer aircraft. The slowdown post-2027 accounts for supply chain stability and a gradual maturation of the ramp. |
| **Space & Defense** (30% of 2024 Sales) | **+5.0%** (Conservative) | **+4.0%** | **+3.0%** | *Stable Growth:* Driven by key programs like **F-35** and classified programs. Assumes a conservative but steady increase in global defense spending and composite adoption. |
| **Industrial** (7% of 2024 Sales) | **+2.0%** (Conservative) | **+2.5%** | **+2.0%** | *Weak Market:* Management noted a challenging and weak market. Assumes a marginal and slow recovery, keeping with a conservative outlook. |

**2024 Net Sales Base:** **\$1,903.0 million**

| Year | Commercial Aerospace (\$M) | Space & Defense (\$M) | Industrial (\$M) | Total Revenue (\$M) | YoY Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 1,199.0 | 570.9 | 133.1 | **1,903.0** | - |
| **2025E** | 1,318.9 | 599.4 | 135.8 | **2,054.1** | **7.9%** |
| **2026E** | 1,424.4 | 623.4 | 139.2 | **2,187.0** | **6.5%** |
| **2027E** | 1,538.4 | 648.3 | 142.7 | **2,329.4** | **6.5%** |
| **2028E** | 1,615.3 | 667.7 | 145.5 | **2,428.5** | **4.3%** |
| **2029E** | 1,696.1 | 687.7 | 148.4 | **2,532.2** | **4.3%** |
| **2030E** | 1,780.9 | 708.3 | 151.4 | **2,640.6** | **4.3%** |

*Note: The 2025E Total Revenue of **\$2,054.1M** is slightly above the midpoint of management's guidance range of \$1.95B to \$2.05B (midpoint \$2.0B). This is a reasonable estimate given the strong Commercial Aerospace growth rate guidance.*

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

**Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **Net Income Margin (2025):** The management guidance for 2025 Adjusted EPS is **\$2.05 to \$2.25**. Using the midpoint of \$2.15 on 81.7 million shares implies a Net Income of **\$175.7 million**. Dividing this by the projected 2025 Revenue of \$2,054.1 million gives a Net Income Margin of **8.55%**.
2.  **Future Net Income Margin (2026 - 2030):** The 2024 Adjusted Operating Income margin was 12.4%. Due to the operating leverage from increasing production rates, the margin is expected to improve. I will assume a conservative, steady improvement from the 2025 base margin to account for better cost absorption as production volume increases.

*   2025E Net Income Margin: **8.55%** (Implied from management's EPS guidance)
*   2026E - 2030E Net Income Margin: A linear, conservative increase of 0.35% per year to reflect operating leverage and efficiency improvements, topping out at a conservative 10.0% by 2030.

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income (NI) before ROIC (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | 2,054.1 | 8.55% | 175.7 |
| **2026E** | 2,187.0 | 8.90% | 194.6 |
| **2027E** | 2,329.4 | 9.25% | 215.5 |
| **2028E** | 2,428.5 | 9.60% | 233.1 |
| **2029E** | 2,532.2 | 9.95% | 251.7 |
| **2030E** | 2,640.6 | 10.00% | 264.1 |

### IV. DCF - Net Present Value Calculation

#### A. ROIC and Additional Income

The model assumes that Net Income for each year goes into cash for the next year, which then generates additional income based on a reasonable Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). HXL has historically focused on internal investment and share repurchases, with a strong emphasis on free cash flow generation (over \$220M guided for 2025).

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Given the capital-intensive nature of the aerospace supply chain and HXL's focus on innovation and capital expenditures, a conservative long-term ROIC is appropriate. I will assume a conservative and achievable **ROIC of 6.0%** on accumulated cash.

| Year | NI from Operations (\$M) | Prior Year NI in Cash (\$M) | ROIC (6.0%) Income (\$M) | Total Net Income (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | 175.7 | - | - | **175.7** |
| **2026E** | 194.6 | 175.7 | 10.5 | **205.1** |
| **2027E** | 215.5 | 175.7 + 205.1 = 380.8 | 22.8 | **238.3** |
| **2028E** | 233.1 | 380.8 + 238.3 = 619.1 | 37.1 | **270.2** |
| **2029E** | 251.7 | 619.1 + 270.2 = 889.3 | 53.4 | **305.1** |
| **2030E** | 264.1 | 889.3 + 305.1 = 1,194.4 | 71.7 | **335.8** |

#### B. Discount Rate

*   **Discount Rate (WACC): 8.5%**
    *   **Justification:** Hexcel is a stable, established supplier in a high-barrier-to-entry industry (Commercial Aerospace). A conservative but reasonable rate is necessary. This rate reflects a moderate-to-low systemic risk (beta) and a reasonable cost of debt, balanced by the cyclical nature and supply chain risk inherent in the aerospace sector.

#### C. Terminal Value

*   **2030E Net Income:** \$335.8 million
*   **Conservative Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate:** **2.0%**
    *   **Justification:** This reflects a growth rate equal to or slightly above long-term inflation or global GDP growth, which is highly conservative for a company still in a ramp-up phase but aligned with the valuation rule for conservatism.
*   **Terminal Value (TV):** (2030E Net Income * (1 + Growth Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)
    *   TV = (\$335.8M * 1.02) / (0.085 - 0.02) = **\$5,236.46 million**

#### D. Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (NI) (\$M) | Discount Factor (8.5%) | Discounted Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 175.7 | 0.9217 | 161.94 |
| **2026** | 205.1 | 0.8495 | 174.24 |
| **2027** | 238.3 | 0.7829 | 186.66 |
| **2028** | 270.2 | 0.7216 | 195.00 |
| **2029** | 305.1 | 0.6650 | 203.26 |
| **2030** | 335.8 | 0.6129 | 205.79 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | 5,236.46 | 0.6129 | 3,209.70 |
| **Sum of Discounted Cash Flows (NPV)** | | | **\$4,336.59 million** |

***

### V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The Fair Value of the Equity is the sum of the Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows and the current Cash on Hand, minus the Total Debt.

1.  **Equity Fair Value** = NPV + Total Cash - Total Debt
    *   Equity Fair Value = \$4,336.59 million + \$89.2 million - \$700.6 million
    *   **Equity Fair Value = \$3,725.19 million**

2.  **Fair Value Per Share** = Equity Fair Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   Fair Value Per Share = \$3,725.19 million / 81.7 million shares
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = \$45.59**

### VI. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value Per Share (DCF): \$45.59**
**Current Stock Price (Hypothetical Market Price): \$71.40**

There is a significant discrepancy between the calculated Fair Value and the hypothetical Current Market Price. The market is valuing HXL at a much higher price than this conservative DCF model suggests.

**Justification for the Discrepancy (Market vs. Model Assumptions):**

The market is likely making **significantly more aggressive assumptions** about the speed and magnitude of the commercial aerospace ramp-up and Hexcel's long-term profitability and growth, specifically:

1.  **Higher Revenue Growth:** The market likely forecasts a longer period of high-teen to low-twenties growth in the Commercial Aerospace segment, driven by an expedited replacement cycle for older aircraft and a faster resolution of OEM supply chain constraints. My model uses a conservative 10.0% for 2025 (management guided) followed by a quick step-down to 5.0% by 2028, which is very cautious given the multi-year backlogs for A320neo and A350. The market may be projecting 8-10% long-term revenue growth.
2.  **Higher Terminal Value / Margin:** The market is likely pricing in a **much higher Net Income Margin** at maturity, perhaps a long-term operating margin closer to its pre-pandemic peak (or higher, given the new focus on operating leverage). My model's mature Net Income Margin of **10.0%** is conservative. An increase to a 12-14% net income margin or a higher terminal growth rate (e.g., 4.0%) would significantly increase the Fair Value per Share to be closer to the market price.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower WACC (e.g., 7.0-7.5%) to reflect Hexcel's strong market position and stable, predictable long-term contracts (a very high-quality revenue base).
4.  **Growth through Acquisition:** Management specifically mentioned they "will also explore inorganic growth through disciplined strategic deployment" of capital. The market may be valuing the company for future, synergistic acquisitions that are not factored into the organic growth assumptions of this model.

The difference in valuation primarily stems from the conservative nature of the long-term growth (2.0% terminal rate) and margin expansion assumptions in this DCF model. To reach the approximate market value of \$71.40, the model would require a terminal growth rate of approximately **4.5%** or a mature net income margin of over **14.0%**. The market believes Hexcel's premium composite materials and essential role in the aerospace supply chain warrants these higher long-term figures.
