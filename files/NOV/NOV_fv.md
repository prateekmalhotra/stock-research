### Part 1: Initial Financial Data (Source: SEC Filings)

The initial financial data is sourced from NOV Inc.'s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on April 29, 2025, for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and other recent filings.

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** (as of Mar 31, 2025) | \$1,157 | 10-Q, March 31, 2025 |
| **Total Debt** (as of Mar 31, 2025) | \$1,737 | 10-Q, March 31, 2025 |
| **Shares Outstanding** (as of Apr 25, 2025) | 375.74 million | 10-Q, April 29, 2025 |
| **Last Full Year Revenue** (FY 2024) | \$8,870 | Q4 2024 Earnings Release |
| **Last Full Year Adjusted EBITDA** (FY 2024) | \$1,110 | Q4 2024 Earnings Release |
| **Last Full Year Net Income** (FY 2024) | \$635 | Q4 2024 Earnings Release |

*Note: The FY 2024 Net Income of \$635 million includes a \$485 million release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2023, which affects year-over-year comparability but the FY 2024 net income of \$635M is the reported GAAP number.*

### Part 2: Business Engine, Revenue, and Margin Projections

#### Business Engine and Revenue Driver Justification

NOV's business engine is segmented into: **Energy Equipment (EE)** and **Energy Products & Services (EPS)**.

1.  **Energy Equipment (EE):** This is the long-cycle business, characterized by manufacturing large capital equipment for deepwater drilling, offshore production (including deepwater flexible pipe), and non-oil & gas energy transition projects (e.g., floating offshore wind). This segment is supported by a large, high-margin backlog, which provides revenue visibility for the coming years. Management commentary notes strong orders for offshore production-related equipment and a backlog that surpassed \$1 billion in Q3 2024.
2.  **Energy Products & Services (EPS):** This is the short-cycle, activity-driven business, largely influenced by North American drilling and completion activity. Management has noted a "soft market outlook" and "lower global activity levels" affecting this segment, partially offset by technology-driven share gains.

**Conservative Revenue Assumptions:**

*   **2025 & 2026 (Soft Market):** Management is guiding for flat adjusted EBITDA around \$1 billion for both 2025 and 2026, which suggests a near-term stall in consolidated growth from the 2024 EBITDA of \$1.11 billion. I will assume a slight, conservative decline in 2025 and flat revenue in 2026 to reflect the "soft market outlook" and the guidance for down year-over-year revenue in the first half of 2025.
    *   **2025:** Revenue decline of **-3.0%** from FY 2024, reflecting the weak short-cycle EPS business.
    *   **2026:** Flat growth of **0.0%**, as the market outlook is for a recovery in "late 2026."
*   **2027 - 2030 (Cyclical Recovery and Long-Cycle Growth):** As the market recovers, led by international and offshore spending (which has a long-cycle positive trend for NOV's EE segment), the revenue growth will accelerate. I will use a modest **5.0%** annual growth rate, which is reasonable for a cyclical upswing combined with benefits from the long-term, high-margin EE backlog and energy transition initiatives.

| Year | Revenue (Millions of USD) | Y-o-Y Growth | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$8,870 | - | Baseline |
| **2025 (Projection)** | **\$8,604** | -3.0% | Conservative decline reflecting management's "soft outlook" and H1 2025 guidance. |
| **2026 (Projection)** | **\$8,604** | 0.0% | Flat year before "late 2026" recovery. |
| **2027 (Projection)** | **\$9,034** | 5.0% | Onset of market recovery, driven by long-cycle offshore/international EE backlog. |
| **2028 (Projection)** | **\$9,486** | 5.0% | Continued recovery and strong EE execution. |
| **2029 (Projection)** | **\$9,960** | 5.0% | Sustained cyclical growth. |
| **2030 (Projection)** | **\$10,458** | 5.0% | Sustained cyclical growth. |

#### Margin and Net Income Projection Justification

*   **Net Income Margin (NIM):** The FY 2024 GAAP NIM was 7.16% (\$635M/\$8,870M). Management is committed to "cost control and operational efficiency," and has a structural cost savings plan of over \$100 million annually. The Energy Equipment segment is already showing improved margins due to high-margin backlog.
*   **Conservative NIM Assumption:** I will start with a conservative **5.0% NIM** for the soft years (2025-2026) and gradually increase it to a long-term normalized **7.5% NIM** by 2030, reflecting the operating leverage, cost-out program, and better product mix from the high-margin EE segment.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for Additional Income:**

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Net income for a given year is assumed to flow into cash and then earn a return in the following year. Since past ROIC may be volatile or negative in downcycles, a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC for *additional income* from retained cash is set at **7.0%**. This is a conservative return for an industrial technology company.

**Net Income Calculation:**

$Net Income_{n} = (Revenue_{n} \times NIM_{n}) + (Retained Earnings_{n-1} \times ROIC)$

For $n=2025$, Retained Earnings from 2024 is the 2024 Net Income, $\\$635M$.

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | NIM (%) | Base Net Income (\$M) | Retained Earnings from Prior Year (\$M) | ROIC (%) | Additional Income (\$M) | **Projected Net Income (\$M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 8,870 | 7.16% | 635 | - | - | - | 635 |
| **2025** | 8,604 | 5.0% | 430 | 635 | 7.0% | 44 | **474** |
| **2026** | 8,604 | 5.5% | 473 | 474 | 7.0% | 33 | **506** |
| **2027** | 9,034 | 6.0% | 542 | 506 | 7.0% | 35 | **577** |
| **2028** | 9,486 | 6.5% | 617 | 577 | 7.0% | 40 | **657** |
| **2029** | 9,960 | 7.0% | 697 | 657 | 7.0% | 46 | **743** |
| **2030** | 10,458 | 7.5% | 784 | 743 | 7.0% | 52 | **836** |

*Retained Earnings for a given year (n) is the Projected Net Income of the prior year (n-1) to calculate the next year's (n) Additional Income.*

### Part 3: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### Discount Rate and Terminal Value Justification

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable discount rate for a cyclical oilfield services and equipment company is used: **10.0%**.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate for the terminal value, reflecting a mature cyclical business, is used: **2.0%**.

#### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model with the final projected cash flow (Net Income for 2030) and the conservative maturity and discount rates.

$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{Net Income_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{Discount Rate - g}$

$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\\$836 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\\$852.72 \text{ million}}{0.08} = \$10,659 \text{ million}$

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected cash flows (Net Income is used as a conservative proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity, FCFE) is calculated using the 10.0% discount rate.

| Year | Projected Net Income (\$M) (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 474 | 0.909 | 431 |
| **2026** | 506 | 0.826 | 418 |
| **2027** | 577 | 0.751 | 433 |
| **2028** | 657 | 0.683 | 449 |
| **2029** | 743 | 0.621 | 461 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | 836 | 0.564 | 471 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | 10,659 | 0.564 | 6,015 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value)** | | | **\$8,678 million** |

---

### Part 4: Fair Value Per Share Calculation

$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$

$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$8,678 \text{ million} + \$1,157 \text{ million} - \$1,737 \text{ million} = **\$8,098 \text{ million}$**

$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\\$8,098 \text{ million}}{375.74 \text{ million shares}} = **\$21.55 \text{ per share}$**

---

### Part 5: Conclusion and Justification

**Current Market Value:** \$15.12 (as of October 30, 2025, from a search result snippet)

**Fair Value Per Share (NOV): $\mathbf{\$21.55}$**

**Market Value Per Share (NOV): $\mathbf{\$15.12}$**

#### Justification for Discrepancy

My conservative fair value of **\$21.55** is substantially higher than the current market value of **\$15.12**, suggesting the stock is undervalued by the market based on my assumptions.

**Why the Market is Discounting the Stock (Assumed Market Assumptions):**

The market is likely making significantly more pessimistic assumptions about NOV's future than my conservative model:

1.  **Lower-for-Longer Oilfield Activity and Cyclical Risk:** The market is discounting the stock due to the current "soft market" for the short-cycle EPS segment and may not be fully pricing in the cyclical recovery I've modeled for 2027-2030. The market's implied perpetual growth rate ($g$) is likely much lower, or even zero, due to fear of sustained weakness in oil and gas capital expenditures.
2.  **Sustained Lower Margins:** The market might be assuming the cost-out programs and the shift to high-margin backlog will not fully translate into higher Net Income margins. If the market assumed a permanently depressed Net Income Margin of **5.5%** and a permanent growth rate of **1.0%**, the fair value would fall closer to the current price.
    *   *Calculation Check (Market Implied):* $\text{Fair Value} \approx \frac{5.5\% \times \$8.87 \text{B} \times (1.01)}{10.0\% - 1.0\%} \approx \$5.45 \text{B}$, which is an equity value of $\\$5.45 \text{B} + \$1.157 \text{B} - \$1.737 \text{B} = \$4.87 \text{B}$ or a share price of $\sim\$12.96$. This suggests the market is pricing in a long-term NIM of $\sim5.5\%$ and a very low growth rate.
3.  **High Discount Rate for Energy Transition Risk:** While I used a 10.0% WACC, the market may be applying an even higher discount rate to account for the perceived risk of the **Energy Transition**. While NOV has a small, growing business in this area (e.g., floating offshore wind), the market may see the long-term, secular risk to their core oil & gas business as a permanent headwind, justifying a higher discount rate and a lower terminal growth rate.

**Why My Assumptions Justify a Higher Fair Value:**

My higher fair value is primarily driven by the belief that:

1.  **Long-Cycle Backlog Provides Visibility:** My model credits NOV's strong and improving backlog in the Energy Equipment segment, which gives multi-year revenue visibility and higher margins that are not yet fully reflected in reported earnings.
2.  **Normalized Profitability:** My model assumes a return to normalized, mid-single-digit Net Income Margins (growing from 5.0% to 7.5%), which is achievable through their ongoing cost-out program and the shift to higher-margin equipment sales. The market is over-discounting the temporary softness in the short-cycle EPS segment.
3.  **Cyclical Recovery is Inevitable:** My assumption of a mid-single-digit (5.0%) growth rate post-2026 is a conservative reflection of the inevitable cyclical recovery in the international and offshore oil & gas markets, which are the main focus of NOV's advanced, high-technology equipment.

**Conclusion:** The market appears to be overly pessimistic about NOV's ability to capitalize on its long-cycle backlog, realize its full margin potential from operational efficiencies, and benefit from the next up-cycle in global energy spending. My conservative DCF analysis suggests the fair value of NOV Inc. stock is **\$21.55 per share**.
