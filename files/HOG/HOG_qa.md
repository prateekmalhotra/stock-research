## Business Summary

Harley-Davidson operates by manufacturing and selling premium, heavyweight motorcycles, primarily targeting affluent customers aged 35 and older in the United States, who are drawn to the brand's heritage, sound, and lifestyle. While the motorcycles themselves generate the most revenue, the business model relies heavily on highly profitable supplementary sales, including parts, accessories for customization, and branded apparel. Furthermore, the company’s financial services division, known as Harley-Davidson Financial Services, provides loans and insurance to customers and dealers, which is crucial for facilitating sales and adding a stable revenue stream. Although the core market remains the U.S., the company has been focused on expanding sales into international markets like Europe and Asia to offset domestic declines.

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk is the aging demographic of Harley-Davidson’s core customer; the company has historically struggled to attract younger riders, leading to declining unit sales in its crucial U.S. market. This trend is concerning because sales volumes dictate manufacturing efficiency and overall market position, a challenge the company has faced repeatedly since the 1980s and especially post-2008. The main long-term risks include aggressive competition from foreign manufacturers and the rapid shift towards electric vehicle technology, which could make Harley’s traditional V-twin engines appear outdated and inefficient, eroding its premium pricing power. Additionally, because the company manufactures most of its motorcycles domestically, it is significantly vulnerable to geopolitical instability and trade tariffs, which have occurred previously (notably tariffs imposed by the EU), leading to higher export costs, reduced profitability, and limiting critical expansion in international markets.

## Company History

This is a detailed history lesson on Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG), explained in simple, jargon-free English.

***

### The History of Harley-Davidson, Inc.

#### **I. The Inception and Founding Purpose (1903)**

1.  The company was founded in 1903 in a small shed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by William S. Harley and brothers Arthur and Walter Davidson.
2.  Their initial goal was purely practical: to create a "motorized bicycle" to make riding easier and faster than pedaling.
3.  Their first design proved too weak to climb the local hills, which taught them a crucial lesson that "power is king," leading them to quickly build a larger, true motorcycle.
4.  The purpose evolved beyond simple transportation, and the brand soon came to represent a lifestyle of independence, freedom, and a uniquely American spirit.

#### **II. Early Growth and Strong Tailwinds (1910s–1950s)**

5.  **Tailwind: Military Contracts.** The U.S. government purchased tens of thousands of their motorcycles for use in both World War I and World War II.
6.  This military demand helped Harley-Davidson expand its production capacity quickly and establish itself as a major, reliable manufacturer on a global scale.
7.  **Tailwind: Survival of the Fittest.** The company developed its powerful V-Twin engine technology early on, and it was one of only two major U.S. motorcycle companies to successfully survive the economic devastation of the Great Depression.
8.  By 1920, the company had grown to become the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, selling bikes in 67 different countries.

#### **III. The Dark Years and a Major Headwind (1970s–1980s)**

9.  **Headwind: Declining Quality.** In 1969, the company was bought by a large conglomerate named AMF, which prioritized cutting costs over maintaining quality, severely damaging the brand's reputation.
10. **Headwind: Japanese Competition.** During this time, foreign competitors like Honda and Yamaha began offering high-quality, reliable, and affordable motorcycles that quickly eroded Harley-Davidson's market share.
11. **Innovative Solution: The Buyout.** In 1981, a group of 13 company executives, including a descendant of the founders, bravely bought the company back from AMF in a risky, debt-heavy move to save the brand.

#### **IV. The Turnaround and Defining Solutions (1980s–2000s)**

12. **Innovative Solution: Quality First.** The new management immediately recommitted to improving the quality of their bikes and brought back the classic, distinct look and sound of the Harley-Davidson engine.
13. **Innovative Solution: Building the "Cult Brand."** The company focused on selling an *experience* and a lifestyle, not just a product, by creating the Harley Owners' Group (HOG) in 1983.
14. **This HOG club** fostered intense customer loyalty and created a global community of riders through rallies and events, making owning a Harley a badge of honor and a way of life.
15. **Tailwind: Government Support.** The U.S. government temporarily imposed high import taxes (tariffs) on large foreign-made motorcycles, which temporarily leveled the playing field and bought Harley-Davidson time to rebuild its quality.

#### **V. Modern Headwinds and The Hardwire Strategy (Present Day)**

16. **Headwind: Aging Customer Base.** A major ongoing problem is that the company's core buyers (the Baby Boomer generation) are getting older, and fewer younger people are buying their traditional large, heavy motorcycles.
17. **Headwind: Limited Product Range.** The company was slow to adapt to changing demands, like the rise of smaller, more nimble bikes and electric vehicles, limiting its reach to new customers globally.
18. **Innovative Solution: "The Hardwire" Strategy.** Harley-Davidson’s current multi-year plan is focused on realigning its business to attract a new generation of riders and improve profitability.
19. **Innovative Solution: New Products and Markets.** They created the separate *LiveWire* electric motorcycle brand and expanded their product line to include lighter models and electric bicycles to appeal to younger and more diverse riders.
20. **Current Goal:** The company is now committed to improving production efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding its presence in international markets while staying true to its original purpose of "fulfilling dreams of personal freedom."

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) is fundamentally built upon its unmatched brand power, which transforms its product from a vehicle into an entire lifestyle and community.

### 1. The Core Moat: Brand and Community

*   **Lifestyle Brand Power:** Harley-Davidson's most significant competitive advantage is its 120+ year-old brand legacy, which sells an experience—freedom, adventure, and rebellion—rather than just a machine.
*   **Powerful Network Effect (H.O.G.):** The Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.), established in 1983, acts as a global community and a massive network effect, enhancing the value of owning a Harley through organized rides, events, and a strong sense of belonging.
*   **Not Easily Displaced:** This deep emotional connection and the existence of a global "Harley family" make customer loyalty rooted in personal identity, which is difficult for a competitor, even one with immense capital, to replicate quickly.

### 2. Product Differentiation and Pricing Power

*   **Premium Pricing Power:** Harley-Davidson motorcycles generally command a significant premium price compared to competitors because of its iconic brand, distinctive styling, unique sound, and customization options.
*   **Unique Product Differentiation:** The differentiation is not primarily based on pure technology or speed, but on unique styling, a specific riding experience, and the culture associated with its traditional Grand American Touring and Cruiser segments.
*   **Market Position:** The company holds a dominant market position, particularly in the U.S. heavyweight motorcycle market, despite the higher price point, which is a clear indicator of pricing power.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Revenue Recurrence

*   **Sticky Customer Base:** The customers are highly sticky because their purchase is often a lifestyle commitment, as evidenced by the high engagement of H.O.G. members and brand advocacy (e.g., brand tattoos).
*   **Recurring Revenue Streams:** The company generates recurring, high-margin revenue from its Parts & Accessories (P&A), General Merchandise (clothing/apparel), and licensed products, which feed into the "lifestyle" aspect of the brand.
*   **In-House Financing Moat:** Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) is a significant competitive advantage, financing a large portion of new motorcycle sales and further locking customers into the ecosystem with convenient, brand-associated financing.

### 4. Strategy and Innovation for Moat Preservation

*   **Historical Growth Factor:** The reason Harley-Davidson grew into what it is today is its historical success in surviving industry consolidation and transforming a quality product into a powerful cultural symbol and community platform.
*   **Commitment to Innovation:** The company invests a substantial amount in research and development (R&D) and must constantly innovate to maintain its edge and attract new riders.
*   **Future-Proofing the Brand:** Harley-Davidson's current "Hardwire" strategic plan includes investing significant time and resources in its most profitable core segments, while also leading the electric motorcycle market with the LiveWire brand.
*   **Targeted R&D Investment:** They have opened a dedicated R&D facility in Silicon Valley to specifically focus on electric vehicle technology, including battery and e-machine design, demonstrating a commitment to securing its future moat in new categories.

## Catalyst Analysis

Harley-Davidson, Inc.'s (HOG) stock price catalysts are primarily driven by a significant financial restructuring, a shift in capital allocation, and new leadership focused on core product strength and brand revitalization.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-18 Months)

1.  **HDFS Capital-Light Transformation.** Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) has been restructured through a partnership with KKR and PIMCO, which management called a "transformative milestone" in the Q2 2025 and Q3 2025 calls. This conversion to a capital-light model is expected to unlock a significant amount of cash, an estimated \$1.2 to \$1.25 billion, by the end of the first quarter of 2026.
2.  **Increased Shareholder Returns.** The cash influx from the HDFS transaction is immediately being used to reduce debt and accelerate the company’s share buyback program. Management planned to reduce debt by \$450 million and buy back \$500 million in shares in the second half of 2025, which should directly boost Earnings Per Share (EPS).
3.  **Improved Dealer Inventory and Health.** Management is focused on reducing global dealer inventory to more disciplined levels, which was down 13% year-over-year at the end of Q3 2025. New CEO Artie Starrs emphasized in his first quarterly report (Q3 2025) that "a healthy Harley depends on a healthy dealer network," indicating a commitment to strengthening dealer profitability and retail traffic.
4.  **Uptick in Consumer Confidence and Interest Rates.** Management repeatedly cited high interest rates and soft consumer confidence for discretionary purchases as a major headwind in recent earnings calls. A future reduction in interest rates or an improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook would be a "needed tailwind" for the stock.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **New CEO and Strategic Focus.** Artie Starrs, the new CEO starting in October 2025, brings experience from outside the traditional motorcycle industry (Topgolf) and is expected to drive fresh innovation and appeal to a broader or younger consumer base. His stated strategy is to intensify the focus on sustainable growth through strong dealer networks, better marketing, and "capital-efficient growth."
2.  **Core Product Strength and New Rider Appeal.** The "Hardwire" strategy involves a focus on the most profitable core categories, with recent successful launches like the redesigned Street Glide and Road Glide touring motorcycles. Management is also emphasizing product affordability and brand repositioning to overcome demographic challenges and attract younger riders.
3.  **LiveWire Evolution (Electric Vehicles).** The electric motorcycle segment, LiveWire, continues to operate at a loss but is positioned as part of the brand's long-term evolution. The company plans to cease providing additional investment to LiveWire beyond the existing line of credit, which limits future financial risk to the parent company.

## Management Record

This analysis of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) management is structured for an investor, focusing on the current/outgoing, incoming, and previous CEO and their strategic impact.

### **1. Management Transition and History**

1.  **Previous CEO (Matthew Levatich):** Levatich stepped down in February 2020 after a five-year tenure marked by an accelerating sales decline and a 46% drop in the company's stock price.
2.  **Failed Strategy:** His strategy, "More Roads to Harley-Davidson," focused on global expansion, attracting younger riders with new models, and a broader portfolio, but failed to arrest the continuous slide in US sales.
3.  **Current/Outgoing CEO (Jochen Zeitz):** Zeitz, a German businessman with a reputation for corporate turnarounds, joined the board in 2007 and was appointed CEO in 2020, having previously served as Chairman and CEO of Puma for 18 years.
4.  **CEO Change Reason:** The board mutually agreed to a leadership change amidst disappointing financial results, prompting Zeitz's initial appointment as Acting CEO to "recharge the business" at the onset of the pandemic.

### **2. Jochen Zeitz's Management & Track Record (2020–2025)**

1.  **The "Rewire" & "Hardwire" Strategy (Future Vision):** Zeitz first enacted "The Rewire," a critical overhaul that streamlined the product portfolio (reducing models by 30%), cut costs ($115 million in savings), and focused on core markets. This restructuring paved the way for the five-year strategic plan, "The Hardwire" (2021-2025).
2.  **Key Strategic Focus:** The Hardwire shifted focus away from the volume-driven approach of his predecessor to prioritizing "desirability" over volume, concentrating on the most profitable core segments (Touring, Large Cruiser, and Trike).
3.  **Delivery on Profitability Promises (Mixed):** The strategy successfully achieved a significant early profit beat (30% stock jump in Q3 2020) and restored HDMC unit profitability to "historically healthy levels," reaching a strong 13.6% operating margin in 2023. However, overall global motorcycle sales continued to decline (down 7% in 2023), and the 2024 revenue outlook was later downgraded due to the challenging macro environment.
4.  **Controversial Key Decision (LiveWire):** Zeitz championed the electric motorcycle segment, spinning off LiveWire into a separate publicly traded company, though the division has struggled with low sales volume and significant operating losses.
5.  **Shareholder Value Delivery:** Management has demonstrated a commitment to shareholders through capital allocation, increasing the quarterly dividend and completing substantial share buybacks (over $674 million in 2022-2023). Despite the positive operating margins in core business, the stock experienced a "dramatic 47% decline over the last year" (as of an April 2025 source).
6.  **Popularity and Sentiment:** Zeitz has faced significant investor scrutiny, including a proxy battle from a major shareholder (H Partners) and public criticism from some traditionalists over his focus on sustainability and the LiveWire venture.

### **3. Future Management & Vision**

1.  **Incoming CEO (Artie Starrs):** Artie Starrs is set to become President and CEO on October 1, 2025, succeeding Jochen Zeitz, who will remain a senior advisor.
2.  **Starrs' Background:** Starrs comes from a strong brand-building and franchise-driven operations background, having been the CEO of Topgolf (where he grew revenue over 50%) and the Global CEO of Pizza Hut.
3.  **Future Strategic Vision:** The incoming leadership is expected to continue executing "The Hardwire" strategy and leveraging Starrs' experience in global operations and a franchise-driven model to grow the brand into its next phase.
4.  **Investor Outlook:** Analyst sentiment is currently divided, with some issuing "Buy" ratings and average price targets suggesting a substantial upside, while others maintain a "Neutral" rating, citing the current market challenges and management limbo during the transition.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Harley-Davidson, Inc.'s (HOG) management incentive and compensation structure, here is the conclusion regarding alignment with shareholder interests, drawn from recent DEF 14A proxy statements.

### I. Insider Ownership and Retention

1.  **Insider Ownership (Low/Standard):** The beneficial ownership of common stock by all directors and executive officers as a group is a very small percentage of total outstanding shares, which is typical for a large, publicly traded company.
2.  **Stock Ownership Guidelines (High):** This low direct ownership is countered by a robust policy requiring the CEO and other executives to own a significant multiple of their base salary in company stock (e.g., the CEO's requirement is a very high six times his base salary).
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** All directors and executive officers are strictly **prohibited from hedging or pledging** company securities, preventing them from insulating themselves from the financial risks of stock price declines that shareholders face.

### II. Executive Compensation Structure (Pay-for-Performance)

1.  **Compensation Mix is Performance-Based:** The company follows a "Pay-for-Performance" philosophy, with the substantial majority of executive target compensation delivered through variable, at-risk incentive plans rather than fixed base salary.
2.  **Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP):** Annual cash bonuses for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) are heavily or entirely weighted toward **Combined HDMC and HDFS Operating Income**. For instance, executives received no STIP payment for 2024 performance as the result was below the threshold, demonstrating a direct link between financial underperformance and lost compensation.
3.  **Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP):** LTI awards are granted as a mix of performance-vesting equity and time-vesting equity, typically **Performance Share Units (PSUs)** and **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**. This mix balances motivating long-term value creation (PSUs) with executive retention (RSUs).
4.  **Shareholder Responsiveness:** In a strong display of good governance, the company responded to shareholder feedback by increasing the portion of the CEO’s 2025 LTIP grant consisting of PSUs to **50% PSUs and 50% RSUs**, further tying his compensation directly to multi-year company performance.

### III. Alignment of Performance Metrics

1.  **Multi-Dimensional Performance Metrics:** The PSUs, which represent a significant portion of long-term pay, are tied to a diverse set of performance metrics that align with the company's "Hardwire" strategy for profitable growth:
    *   **Financial/Efficiency:** Metrics include **HDMC Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** and **HDMC Revenue**, focusing executives on both top-line growth and efficient capital utilization.
    *   **Strategic/Non-Financial:** Metrics also include non-financial goals such as **Workforce Engagement** and **Increased Diversity of Leadership Roles**, encouraging the development of sustainable, long-term operational and human capital advantages.
2.  **Three-Year Focus:** PSUs vest based on performance over a three-year period, forcing management to focus on strategic, sustained growth rather than short-term gains.

### Conclusion: Alignment with Shareholder Interests

Management has **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

The incentive structure is overwhelmingly designed to align management with long-term shareholder value creation:
*   A vast majority of pay is **at-risk** and only earned through achieving rigorous financial, operational, and strategic goals (Operating Income, ROIC, Revenue).
*   Mandatory, high **stock ownership guidelines** and the **prohibition of hedging** enforce a personal financial stake for management in the long-term success of the stock price, directly linking their personal wealth to shareholder returns.
*   The compensation committee has demonstrated **responsiveness to shareholder feedback** by adjusting the CEO's pay mix toward higher-risk, performance-based equity.

### **Interesting Questions (Recent Stock Movements)**

5.  **Recent Price Drop:** HOG shares have been under pressure, **falling about 12% over the past three months** and extending a broader year-long downtrend.
6.  **Reason for Drops:** The sustained price decline is largely attributed to fundamental challenges, including weak consumer demand, market share erosion, and a heavy reliance on a continually **aging core customer base**.
7.  **Impact of International Sales:** A notable price drop in April 2024 occurred despite an earnings beat, because the company reported a **significant drop in international retail demand** across the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions.
8.  **Positive Factor / Potential Gain:** A recent positive development includes a new partnership in Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS), which provided a **cash infusion and unlocked \$1.25 billion in cash**, which is intended to reduce leverage and fund accelerated share buybacks and growth investments.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Harley-Davidson rests on its financial restructuring and the strength of its iconic lifestyle brand. The company recently completed a major deal for its financing arm (HDFS) that is set to immediately unlock over $1.2 billion in cash. This massive cash infusion will be used to pay down debt and aggressively buy back stock, directly boosting the value of each remaining share. While the number of bikes sold has fallen, management successfully switched strategies to focus on selling fewer, more expensive motorcycles, achieving excellent profit margins in its core business. The brand's unparalleled loyalty and global community (H.O.G.) provide highly profitable recurring revenue from parts, accessories, and apparel. The incoming CEO is expected to leverage his experience to modernize the brand's appeal and successfully attract new, younger riders, securing the company's future while minimizing the financial risk associated with its electric bike division (LiveWire).

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. The significant cash infusion (over $1.2 billion) from the HDFS restructuring is successfully realized and used to execute the planned debt reduction and stock buybacks, leading to a direct increase in earnings per share (EPS). 2. The core customer base, while aging, remains intensely loyal and continues to purchase high-margin parts and accessories, preventing revenue from collapsing. 3. The new CEO successfully implements fresh strategies that attract enough new, younger riders to stabilize or grow domestic sales volumes, proving the brand can overcome its demographic challenges. 4. Macroeconomic conditions, specifically high interest rates and soft consumer confidence, must improve to encourage discretionary spending on premium motorcycles.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for Harley-Davidson contains several critical flaws and overlooks recent negative financial trends. The key faults lie in misinterpreting one-time financial maneuvers as long-term fixes, overestimating the brand's recurring revenue stability, and downplaying the ongoing decline in core sales and profitability.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Bull Thesis**

1.  **HDFS Restructuring is a Trade-Off, Not Pure Value Unlock:** While the HDFS deal unlocked over **$1.2 billion in cash** and led to a one-time surge in EPS, it structurally reduces the company's future recurring revenue. The "capital-light" model involves **selling approximately two-thirds of future retail loan originations**, which will cause HDFS's operating income to fall substantially in the subsequent year before recovering, sacrificing a stable, profitable revenue stream for a short-term cash infusion.

2.  **Core Business Profit Margins are Deteriorating, Not "Excellent":** The strategy of focusing on selling "fewer, more expensive motorcycles" is failing to fully compensate for volume loss. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) operating income margin is **declining** (e.g., falling to 26.4% in Q3 2025 from 30.1% a year prior), and the segment's operating income was down in recent quarters. This indicates the market for premium motorcycles is shrinking faster than the company can raise prices or cut costs.

3.  **Loyalty is Not Preventing Discretionary Revenue Collapse:** The assumption that the **"unparalleled loyalty"** ensures highly profitable recurring revenue from parts, accessories, and apparel (PG&A) is directly contradicted by recent results. Parts & Accessories revenue was **down 14% in Q1 2025** and full-year 2024 PG&A revenue missed the company's $\$1$ billion target, declining by $5.6\%$ from the prior year. This shows even the intensely loyal core customer base is curtailing high-margin discretionary spending.

4.  **Sales Volumes are in Steep Decline, Challenging Strategy Success:** Despite management's "successful switch" in strategy, **global retail sales continue to fall significantly** (e.g., down $6\%$ in Q3 2025, with North America down $5\%$). The new CEO must prove his ability to grow sales against a trend of accelerating volume declines, a challenge that has not been "successfully" addressed yet.

5.  **LiveWire Financial Risk is Undermined by Ongoing Losses:** The electric bike division (LiveWire) is a dedicated financial drag, not a minimized risk. The segment continues to post substantial operating losses, with a projected annual operating loss of **\$70 to \$80 million for 2025**. Furthermore, unit sales are extremely low, indicating the brand has not secured a meaningful foothold in the future of the motorcycle market.

6.  **Macroeconomic Assumption is Contradicted by Management Action:** The bull case relies on macroeconomic conditions *improving*, but management explicitly cited the **"uncertain global tariff situation and macroeconomic conditions"** (high interest rates and soft consumer confidence) as the reason for withdrawing its full-year 2025 financial outlook. This indicates macro headwinds are a significant, present headwind that management cannot confidently predict an end to, invalidating the optimistic assumption.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG)**

The bear case rests on the conviction that Harley-Davidson's ongoing secular decline in its core market will outpace the temporary boost from its financial engineering and cost-cutting measures, leading to sustained revenue erosion and a lower valuation.

1.  **Structural Headwinds Overpower One-Time Gains:** Harley-Davidson's decision to monetize its finance arm (HDFS) is a short-term financial fix that comes at the expense of a long-term, high-return revenue stream. The immediate EPS benefit from the cash infusion masks the impending **structural decline in HDFS's future operating income**, which will result in lower, more volatile overall earnings.

2.  **Irreversible Demographic and Demand Collapse:** The core demographic is aging out, and the company is failing to recruit a replacement wave of young riders, as evidenced by the sustained double-digit decline in global retail motorcycle sales and a decrease in customer traffic at dealerships. The market is not just cyclical; it is shrinking, and efforts to "sell fewer, more expensive" bikes are simultaneously driving down volumes and **failing to prevent a decline in gross margins**.

3.  **Erosion of Brand Premium and Ancillary Revenue:** The decline in highly profitable Parts, Accessories, and Apparel revenue proves that even the deeply loyal customer base is reducing its discretionary spending due to economic pressure. This shrinkage in the high-margin PG&A segment, a key part of the brand's identity and profitability, points to an **erosion of the H.O.G. community's purchasing power and commitment**, putting pressure on overall profitability.

4.  **The LiveWire Money Pit:** LiveWire is a speculative venture that functions as a drain on capital. With projected annual losses of up to $\$80$ million for 2025 and minimal unit sales, it represents a substantial financial risk that siphons funds away from the struggling core combustion engine business, delaying its necessary reinvention.
