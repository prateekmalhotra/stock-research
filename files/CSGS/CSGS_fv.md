## II. Valuation Model Assumptions and Business Engine Analysis

### A. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

CSG's business engine is driven by its highly recurring revenue model, primarily from its core communications segment (cable/telecom), and its strategic shift towards **SaaS and related solutions** in faster-growing new industry verticals (fintech, retail, healthcare) [cite: 7, step 3],. The company's key strategic driver is accelerating organic revenue growth and diversifying its revenue base.

| Metric | Base Value/Driver | Management Guidance | Conservative Assumption (Organic Growth) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025 Revenue** | $1,223.3M | Actual Reported Revenue. | $1,223.3M | Starting point for the model. |
| **Long-Term Revenue Growth** | N/A | 2% to 6% pure organic revenue growth. | **3.0%** (2026-2030) | A conservative assumption, using a rate slightly below the midpoint of the long-term guidance (2%-6%) to account for potential macroeconomic headwinds and the slow transition away from its dominant, slower-growing core business. |

**Revenue Projection (in millions USD)**

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Calculation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $1,260.0 | $1,223.3M * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2027** | $1,297.8 | $1,260.0M * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2028** | $1,336.7 | $1,297.8M * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2029** | $1,376.8 | $1,336.7M * (1 + 3.0%) |
| **2030** | $1,418.1 | $1,376.8M * (1 + 3.0%) |

### B. Margin and Net Income Projections

Management has guided for a long-term non-GAAP operating margin of **18% to 20%**. For the purpose of this conservative DCF based on *Net Income*, I will use the *GAAP Net Income Margin* and project a modest, conservative expansion towards the midpoint of the non-GAAP guidance, assuming improving operating leverage from the shift to SaaS solutions.

*   **Historical GAAP Net Income Margin (FY 2024):** $86.9M / $1,197.2M = **7.26%** [cite: 9, step 2], [cite: 7, step 3]
*   **Projected GAAP Net Income Margin:** I will assume a conservative annual increase of **50 basis points (0.50%)** per year, from the implied 2025 margin of 4.37% (Net Income $53.48M / Revenue $1,223.3M, calculated from $1.98 EPS [cite: 7, step 3]) towards the 18-20% non-GAAP target. This slow expansion is conservative, as the actual 2025 GAAP Net Income was suppressed, likely due to one-time charges related to strategic shifts, making the starting point artificially low.

| Year | Net Income Margin (Assumption) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | 4.37% (Calculated from $1.98 EPS) [cite: 7, step 3] |
| **2026** | 4.87% |
| **2027** | 5.37% |
| **2028** | 5.87% |
| **2029** | 6.37% |
| **2030** | 6.87% |

### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption

The historical ROIC will be calculated using the following conservative estimate:
*   Invested Capital (IC) = Total Debt + Total Equity.
*   Total Equity (Est.) = Total Debt ($539.45M) / Debt-to-Equity Ratio (1.99) = $271.08M.
*   IC (Est.) = $539.45M + $271.08M = $810.53M.
*   Historical ROIC (2024 Net Income) = $86.9M / $810.53M = 10.72%.

**Conservative ROIC Assumption for Projection: 10.0%**

This is a conservative ROIC, slightly lower than the calculated historical rate of 10.72%, and significantly lower than the market-implied trailing ROIC of 26.83%, aligning with the principle of conservatism.

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

### A. Projected Cash Flows (Net Income)

The projected Net Income for each year is calculated as:
**Net Income = (Revenue * Net Income Margin) + (Prior Year's Net Income * ROIC)**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base NI (A * B) | ROIC Income (C) | Total NI (Base NI + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,223.3 | 4.37% | $53.48 | N/A | $53.48 (Base) |
| **2026** | $1,260.0 | 4.87% | $61.35 | $53.48 * 10.0% = $5.35 | $66.70 |
| **2027** | $1,297.8 | 5.37% | $69.74 | $66.70 * 10.0% = $6.67 | $76.41 |
| **2028** | $1,336.7 | 5.87% | $78.80 | $76.41 * 10.0% = $7.64 | $86.44 |
| **2029** | $1,376.8 | 6.37% | $87.72 | $86.44 * 10.0% = $8.64 | $96.36 |
| **2030** | $1,418.1 | 6.87% | $97.43 | $96.36 * 10.0% = $9.64 | $107.07 |

### B. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** 2.0%
    *   This is a conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above the typical long-term inflation rate, assuming the company matures but still grows with the broader economy.
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** 10.0%
    *   A conservative, reasonable rate, representing a relatively high required rate of return for equity investors in a stable, but slow-growing technology/services company.

### C. Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
*   TV = [Cash Flow (2030) * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
*   TV = [$107.07M * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = $109.21M / 0.08
*   **TV = $1,365.13 million**

### D. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Present Value (PV) of each projected cash flow (Net Income) is calculated using the formula: PV = CF / (1 + r)^t

| Year | Cash Flow (NI) | Discount Factor @ 10.0% | Present Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $66.70 | 0.9091 | $60.63 |
| **2027** | $76.41 | 0.8264 | $63.14 |
| **2028** | $86.44 | 0.7513 | $64.94 |
| **2029** | $96.36 | 0.6830 | $65.80 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | $107.07 | 0.6209 | $66.50 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | $1,365.13 | 0.6209 | $847.60 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$1,168.61** |

---

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

1.  **Total Equity Value** = NPV of Future Cash Flows + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
    *   Total Equity Value = $1,168.61M + $180.0M - $539.45M
    *   **Total Equity Value = $809.16 million**

2.  **Fair Value Per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
    *   Fair Value Per Share = $809.16 million / 27.01 million shares
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = $29.96**

---

## V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $29.96**

**Current Market Price (Reference): $79.75**

### Justification for the Difference

The calculated fair value of **$29.96 per share** is significantly lower than the current market price of **~$79.75**, suggesting the market is making much more aggressive assumptions than this conservative model.

The market's implied assumptions compared to the model's conservative assumptions are:

1.  **Higher Revenue Growth:** The market likely believes CSGS will achieve or exceed the high end of its long-term organic revenue growth target of **6.0%** (vs. the model's 3.0%). This high growth is expected to come from its transition to a higher-growth **SaaS platform** model, penetrating new verticals like retail and fintech [cite: 7, step 3].

2.  **Faster Margin Expansion (SaaS Operating Leverage):** The market is likely pricing in a rapid expansion of the GAAP Net Income margin toward and possibly beyond the **18-20% non-GAAP operating margin target**. The market believes the operating leverage from their high-margin SaaS deals will accelerate profit conversion much faster than the conservative 50 bps annual increase used in this model. The market-implied Net Income margin in the terminal period would be closer to **12-15%** for a valuation near $80.

3.  **Higher Terminal Value Assumption:** The market likely uses a much lower Discount Rate (r) or a higher conservative Maturity Rate (g) than the $10.0\%$ and $2.0\%$ used here, respectively. A high-growth tech company is often valued with an **r closer to 8%** and a **g closer to 3.0%-3.5%**, which drastically increases the Terminal Value.

The difference of **~$50 per share** is justified by the model's adherence to a *conservative* interpretation of management's guidance and historical GAAP performance:
*   Using the lower half of the 2%-6% organic growth range.
*   Projecting a very slow increase in the GAAP Net Income Margin.
*   Utilizing a conservative 10.0% ROIC and 10.0% Discount Rate.

**In summary, the market is viewing CSGS as a high-growth SaaS and Digital Monetization company that is successfully diversifying away from its slow-growth telecom core and is betting on the acceleration of its long-term revenue and margin targets. This valuation views CSGS as a stable, slow-growing technology services company with a moderate margin expansion runway.**
