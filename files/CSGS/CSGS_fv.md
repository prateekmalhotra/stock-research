## 2. Business Engine and Conservative Projections

CSG's business engine is characterized by a high-recurring revenue (SaaS-focused) model, driven by three key factors: **1) new logo sales wins**, **2) deal expansions with existing major customers** (e.g., Charter, Comcast until 2030), and **3) revenue diversification** into faster-growing industry verticals outside of Communications Service Providers (CSPs), such as financial services and retail. Management has a long-term aspiration for organic revenue growth in the 2% to 6% range. The focus is on higher-margin SaaS deals, which is expected to expand profitability.

### **A. Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

The projections are based on management's official guidance and a conservative tapering of growth, acknowledging their efforts in high-growth segments while remaining disciplined.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Y-o-Y Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $1,200 (approx. LTM) | - | Derived from historical data/context. |
| **2025 (Projected)** | **$1,210** | **0.8%** | Using the conservative low end of the management's full-year guidance of $1.21 to $1.25 billion. |
| **2026 (Projected)** | **$1,246** | **3.0%** | Uses the midpoint of management's expected "similar 2% to 4% revenue growth range in 2026". |
| **2027 (Projected)** | **$1,277** | **2.5%** | A slight, conservative moderation from the 2026 guidance. |
| **2028 (Projected)** | **$1,303** | **2.0%** | Tapering toward a conservative long-term growth rate. |
| **2029 (Projected)** | **$1,329** | **2.0%** | Conservative long-term growth. |
| **2030 (Projected)** | **$1,356** | **2.0%** | Conservative long-term growth. |

### **B. Net Income Margin Projections**

Management guides for a long-term Non-GAAP Operating Margin of **18% to 20%** and an expectation for the bottom line to grow faster than the top line. The last twelve months' (LTM) GAAP Net Income Margin was approximately 7.24% ($\frac{\$86.85M}{\$1,200M}$).

To be conservative, the DCF model uses Net Income Margin, starting slightly above the LTM GAAP margin and gradually increasing toward the low end of the Non-GAAP operating goal.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **8.0%** | Conservative increase from LTM GAAP margin (7.24%), reflecting early benefits of cost efficiency. |
| **2026** | **8.5%** | Continued, gradual margin expansion. |
| **2027** | **9.0%** | Continued, gradual margin expansion. |
| **2028** | **9.5%** | Continued, gradual margin expansion. |
| **2029** | **10.0%** | Reflects management's goal for bottom-line to outpace top-line, still very conservative versus 18%-20% Non-GAAP Op Margin target. |
| **2030** | **10.0%** | Stabilized, conservative long-term margin. |

### **C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

*   **ROIC Assumption:** **6.0%**
*   **Justification:** A conservative, reasonable positive rate for a mature, improving software/IT services company. This assumes the management effectively reinvests or utilizes the retained cash (Net Income from the previous year).

---

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The DCF calculation uses Net Income as a proxy for the cash flow available to equity holders (Free Cash Flow to Equity - FCFE), as is often done for non-capital-intensive, mature companies with stable working capital.

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative WACC Proxy):** **9.0%**
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.0%** (A very conservative rate, below historical and expected GDP growth, matching the long-term revenue growth rate assumption).

### **Projected Net Income and NPV**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) (A x Margin) | ROIC on Prior Year NI (C) | Total Cash Flow to Equity (D) (B+C) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of FCFE (D x Factor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 1,210 | 8.0% | 96.8 | - | 96.8 | 0.917 | 88.75 |
| **2026** | 1,246 | 8.5% | 105.9 | 5.8 (96.8 x 6.0%) | 111.7 | 0.842 | 94.05 |
| **2027** | 1,277 | 9.0% | 114.9 | 6.7 (111.7 x 6.0%) | 121.6 | 0.772 | 93.89 |
| **2028** | 1,303 | 9.5% | 123.8 | 7.3 (121.6 x 6.0%) | 131.1 | 0.708 | 92.83 |
| **2029** | 1,329 | 10.0% | 132.9 | 7.9 (131.1 x 6.0%) | 140.8 | 0.650 | 91.52 |
| **2030** | 1,356 | 10.0% | 135.6 | 8.5 (140.8 x 6.0%) | 0.596 | 80.76 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | | **$541.80** |

### **Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the **2030 Cash Flow to Equity** ($135.6 million). The ROIC factor is *excluded* for the perpetuity assumption, as the cash flow into perpetuity is assumed to be the stabilized FCF/Net Income.

*   **Terminal Cash Flow (NI 2030):** $135.6 million
*   **Terminal Value:** $\frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$
*   **Terminal Value (TV):** $\frac{\$135.6 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$138.3}{0.07} = \$1,975.7$ million
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (NPV TV):** $\text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   **NPV of TV:** $\$1,975.7 \times 0.596 = **\$1,178.61**$ million

### **Total Equity Value**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Projected FCFE (2025-2030) | $541.80 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $1,178.61 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$1,720.41** |
| Less: Net Debt | $391.90 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$1,328.51** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Market Comparison

### **Fair Value Per Share**

*   **Total Equity Value:** $1,328.51$ million
*   **Shares Outstanding:** $28.977$ million
*   **Fair Value Per Share:** $\frac{\$1,328.51}{28.977} = **\$45.85**$

### **Comparison and Justification**

| Metric | Fair Value (DCF) | Market Value (October 2025) | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price Per Share** | **$45.85** | **~$67.62** | **-32.2%** |

The calculated Fair Value of **$45.85** is significantly lower than the current market price of ~$67.62. This indicates that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about CSGS's future growth and/or profitability than the conservative model.

**Analysis of the Difference:**

1.  **Revenue Growth:** The DCF model uses a very conservative, tapering growth profile (starting at 0.8% and stabilizing at 2.0%). The market is likely pricing in a consistent **higher organic growth rate** toward the high end or even above the management's 2%-6% long-term aspiration, particularly from the faster-growing SaaS solutions and vertical market expansion. For example, a perpetual growth rate assumption of **3.5%** (instead of 2.0%) would increase the Terminal Value NPV to approximately $1,610 million, resulting in a Fair Value of ~$60 per share, much closer to the current price.

2.  **Profitability (Margin):** The DCF model uses a conservative Net Income Margin (stabilizing at 10.0%) as a proxy for FCFE, while management is guiding for non-GAAP operating margins between 18.1% to 18.5% in 2025 and a long-term range of 18% to 20%. The market is likely valuing the company closer to its **Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow**, which management guided to a midpoint of $135 million for 2025 (a margin of $\frac{\$135}{\$1,210} \approx 11.2\%$ in 2025). The market assumes the company will close the gap between its GAAP Net Income Margin and its higher Non-GAAP Operating Margin, converting non-cash charges (like amortization of acquired intangibles) more effectively into tangible cash flow.

3.  **Shareholder Return Policy:** CSGS has a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders ($100M+ in 2025 via buybacks and dividends). The market may be factoring in the continued reduction of the share count at a greater pace than implicitly assumed by the stable share count in this valuation.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF valuation suggests CSGS is overvalued based on the most cautious interpretation of management guidance. However, the market is primarily valuing CSGS as a successful, cash-generating **SaaS/BSS transition story** that will realize its full profitability (i.e., achieving an FCF margin closer to its 18-20% Non-GAAP Op Margin goal) and maintain a long-term growth rate above the conservative 2.0% terminal rate used here. The difference is primarily due to the market's higher expectations for sustained growth and profit margin realization from the core business.

**Fair Value Conclusion:**

The conservative intrinsic value for CSG Systems International, Inc. (CSGS) common stock is:

# **\$45.85 per share**
