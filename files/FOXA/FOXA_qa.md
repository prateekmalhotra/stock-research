## Business Summary

Fox Corporation primarily operates in the United States, generating revenue mainly through its highly valuable News (Fox News) and Sports (Fox Sports) divisions. The core business model operates by providing essential content to large television distribution companies (B2B), such as cable providers and virtual streaming services. These distributors pay Fox substantial monthly affiliate fees for every subscriber they have, representing the largest and most stable revenue stream. The secondary revenue stream comes from selling advertising time during highly viewed programs, especially live events and news broadcasts, to businesses seeking to reach a large U.S. consumer audience. Therefore, Fox acts as a critical content provider sitting between advertisers, viewers, and cable middlemen.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term and long-term risk is the decline of the traditional cable bundle, a trend known as ‘cord-cutting.’ As consumers cancel expensive cable packages and move to streaming services, the fundamental pool of customers paying Fox's crucial affiliate fees shrinks, directly harming Fox’s primary revenue source. This trend has accelerated significantly in recent years, putting sustained downward pressure on earnings. Additionally, advertising revenue is volatile and immediately impacted by economic downturns, as companies cut marketing budgets during recessions. A long-term structural risk involves the escalating cost of acquiring rights to essential live sports content (like the NFL). Fox must spend increasing amounts to maintain its competitive edge, which squeezes profit margins if subscriber and advertising growth cannot keep pace. Finally, as a major news provider, the company faces elevated political and reputational risk; controversies or legal challenges can harm audience trust and cause advertisers to pause spending.

### **The History of Fox Corporation (FOXA): From Spin-Off to Focused Media Powerhouse**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **A Company Born from a Sale:** The modern Fox Corporation was not created from scratch, but officially launched on March 19, 2019, as the result of a massive deal in the media world.
2.  **Why It Was Founded:** Its predecessor, 21st Century Fox, sold the majority of its film and entertainment studios—like 20th Century Fox and FX Networks—to The Walt Disney Company.
3.  **The Goal: Focus on Live Content:** The new Fox Corporation was created to keep the parts of the business focused on live events: news, sports, and the national broadcast network. This strategy aimed to build an agile company centered on "appointment-based" content that people watch immediately, which is especially valuable to advertisers.

#### **II. Core Business Segments**

4.  **Cable Network Programming (The Cash Engine):** This segment includes the globally recognized FOX News Channel and FOX Business Network, as well as sports cable networks like FS1 and FS2. These networks generate significant revenue primarily through affiliate fees (the money cable and satellite companies pay to carry the channel) and advertising.
5.  **Television (The Local Connection):** This segment includes the FOX broadcast network, which airs popular entertainment shows and major sports events, and a collection of local television stations across the United States. These local stations are crucial for broadcasting local news and reaching a vast audience in the largest US markets.
6.  **The Digital Future: Tubi Media Group:** The company also operates its growing digital and streaming businesses, which are now organized under a unit called Tubi Media Group.

#### **III. Headwinds (The Challenges the Company Faced)**

7.  **Headwind: The "Cord-Cutting" Crisis:** The biggest industry challenge is the trend of "cord-cutting," where people cancel expensive traditional cable and satellite subscriptions to switch to cheaper streaming services. Since Fox's cable channels rely on revenue from those cable subscriptions (affiliate fees), this shift threatens a major income source.
8.  **Headwind: Rebuilding Entertainment Content:** When the original film and TV studios were sold to Disney, the new Fox Corporation suddenly lacked a major in-house studio to create its general entertainment shows. It had to quickly figure out how to produce or buy the non-news and non-sports programs needed for its broadcast network.
9.  **Headwind: Major Legal and Reputational Problems:** One of its main assets, FOX News, has faced significant legal scrutiny and controversy. A high-profile example was the defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, which Fox Corporation settled for a staggering \$787.5 million, marking a considerable financial hit.

#### **IV. Innovative Solutions and Strategies**

10. **Innovative Solution: Embracing Free Streaming (Tubi):** Instead of competing directly with subscription giants like Netflix and Disney+, Fox acquired the free, ad-supported streaming service **Tubi** in 2020. This move allowed Fox to capture a rapidly growing audience of "cord-cutters" who prefer a free service supported by advertising, rather than paying a monthly fee.
11. **Strategy: Doubling Down on Live Programming:** Fox invested heavily in retaining and securing exclusive rights to high-value live events, especially major sports like the NFL (including the Super Bowl). Live sports and news are considered "drought-proof" against on-demand viewing because people still want to watch them *as they happen*.
12. **Innovative Solution: Creating New In-House Studios:** To solve the content pipeline problem, Fox launched its own new production arm, Fox Entertainment Studios, and acquired smaller studios like Bento Box Entertainment (for animation) and MarVista Entertainment. This ensures they own a stake in the entertainment programming they air.
13. **Strategy: Entering the Creator Economy:** The company acquired businesses like Red Seat Ventures, which partners with influential talent (podcasters and personalities) to build their own direct-to-consumer media businesses. This helps Fox expand its digital footprint and reach younger audiences on platforms outside of traditional TV.

#### **V. Tailwinds (Favorable Conditions the Company Had)**

14. **Tailwind: The Enduring Value of Live News and Sports:** The most significant advantage for Fox is that its core assets—FOX News and FOX Sports—provide content that must be watched live. This makes them essential for cable distributors and a premier choice for advertisers who need a massive, guaranteed audience at a specific time.
15. **Tailwind: Strong Affiliate Fee Revenue:** Despite cord-cutting, for a significant time after the spin-off, the existing contracts with cable and satellite companies provided a large, predictable, and growing stream of revenue (affiliate fees). This financial cushion gave the new, focused company time and money to invest in its digital future.

## Moat Analysis

Fox Corporation's (FOXA) competitive advantage, or "moat," is primarily built on its strategic focus on **premium, live content** in news and sports, which are the most resilient parts of the traditional television ecosystem.

Here is an analysis of its moat and market position:

### The Core Moat: "Must-Have" Live Content

1.  **Unique Content Focus:** Fox Corporation strategically focuses its core business on live news and live sports, which are significantly more resistant to cord-cutting and streaming disruption than general entertainment programming.
2.  **Fox News Media Dominance:** Fox News is a dominant, top-rated brand in the cable news sector, providing a strong, highly loyal, and engaged audience that is essential for distributors and advertisers.
3.  **Exclusive Sports Rights:** Fox Sports holds expensive, multi-year, exclusive rights to "tentpole" sporting events, such as key NFL games, major MLB events (like the World Series), and high-profile college conferences. This content is non-replicable and must be carried by distributors to satisfy a large segment of their subscribers.

### Special Position and Pricing Power

4.  **Exceptional Pricing Power:** The "must-carry" status of Fox News and top-tier Fox Sports content gives the company significant leverage to demand higher **affiliate fees** (the monthly fee distributors like cable companies pay to carry the network) and higher **advertising rates**.
5.  **Advertising Premium:** Fox's loyal and large live-viewing audience ensures a massive reach in key demographic groups, allowing the company to command premium pricing from advertisers.
6.  **Insulation from Competitors:** Unlike many traditional media peers who have a large portfolio of commoditized entertainment channels, Fox's focused portfolio helps insulate it from the intense, head-to-head competition with giants like Netflix and Disney+ in the general entertainment space.

### Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

7.  **Sticky, Recurring Contracts:** A significant portion of Fox's revenue comes from recurring **affiliate fees** negotiated with cable, satellite, and digital providers. These are long-term contracts that are re-negotiated periodically, not one-time sales.
8.  **Loyal Fan Base:** The customer loyalty is largely to the content itself, especially the distinct viewpoint of Fox News and the passionate following for its exclusive sports broadcasts, creating a high barrier for competitors to lure them away.

### Ease of Displacement and Network Effects

9.  **High Barrier to Entry:** The business is difficult to displace by a competitor with just more capital, primarily because of the massive, long-term capital required to secure exclusive, comparable sports rights and the decades of brand building necessary to create a news entity with the audience loyalty of Fox News.
10. **Traditional Network Effects:** Fox benefits from a powerful, though traditional, virtuous cycle: high-quality, exclusive content draws a large audience, which attracts more advertisers and enables the company to charge higher distribution fees, generating more capital to buy more exclusive content. This loop makes its position stronger over time.

### Strategic Actions to Maintain the Moat

11. **Investment in Digital and Streaming:** To counter the risk of cord-cutting, Fox is actively transitioning its assets to new distribution models through its digital portfolio, including the free ad-supported streaming service **Tubi** and subscription video-on-demand services like **FOX Nation**.
12. **Focus on Tech Innovation for Advertising:** The company is investing in advanced, AI-driven advertising technology platforms to offer better audience modeling and targeted advertising across its linear (TV) and digital properties, ensuring it can maximize revenue from its audience as viewing habits change.
13. **R&D and Constant Innovation:** While media companies don't have large traditional R&D budgets like tech or pharma, Fox must constantly innovate in two ways: by securing and developing new, compelling content (the industry's form of R&D) and by continuously investing in advertising technology to keep pace with digital platforms.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on recent news, investor releases, and earnings calls, the catalysts for Fox Corporation's (FOXA) stock price can be analyzed in the near and long term.

***

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Political Advertising Revenue Cycle**
    *   The 2024–2025 election cycle is a major revenue driver, with local stations benefiting from significant political ad spending, a phenomenon noted in recent quarterly results. Management highlighted that the fiscal year 2025 saw a substantial boost from this, especially in the first half of the year.

2.  **Major Sports Programming**
    *   Big-ticket live sports, like the high ratings for NFL and MLB postseason games, drive both advertising and affiliate revenue due to the company’s ownership of key sports rights. The success of these live events gives Fox an edge over on-demand streaming platforms.

3.  **Digital Advertising Strength from Tubi**
    *   Continued strong growth in the Tubi ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) service provides an immediate digital revenue boost. Management has repeatedly called out Tubi’s momentum and has guided for its annual revenue to potentially cross the \$1 billion mark.

4.  **Capital Return to Shareholders**
    *   Fox continues to generate strong cash flow and uses it for aggressive share repurchases, which can directly support the stock price. Management has announced increases in the share repurchase authorization, signaling a commitment to returning capital.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Success of FOX ONE Streaming Bundle**
    *   The company's new streaming product, FOX ONE, aims to bundle Fox properties for "cord-cutters" without cannibalizing existing pay-TV relationships. CEO Lachlan Murdoch has stated this new service is on track to launch before the football season, positioning it as a key step in expanding digital offerings.

2.  **Sustained Digital Expansion via Tubi**
    *   Tubi represents the company’s organic, high-growth engine, with a focus on its large and diverse ad-supported audience. Management is strategically investing to grow this platform, viewing it as a long-term potential disruptor to traditional subscription-based services.

3.  **Affiliate Fee Growth from Pricing Power**
    *   Fox's strategy relies on securing higher pricing in its affiliate fee renewals, even as overall subscriber numbers in the traditional cable industry decline. Management consistently points to affiliate fee growth, underscoring the strength and value of their core content, particularly their news and sports programming.

4.  **Major International Sports Events**
    *   Key future sporting events, such as the FIFA tournament mentioned by management in the Q4 2025 call (scheduled for Q4 of the coming fiscal year and Q1 of the next fiscal year), provide large, temporary advertising revenue bumps.

***

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Commentary

*   **Core Strategy:** CEO Lachlan Murdoch consistently emphasizes a strategy built on a "strong foundation" from its live sports and news verticals, which ensures audience and advertising demand.
*   **Digital Investment:** Management is focused on continued investment in digital growth, particularly for Tubi, viewing it as a high-growth asset.
*   **Financial Outlook:** CFO Steve Tomsic noted that the business structure is strong, with its current valuation reflecting market skepticism that the digital segment (Tubi, FOX ONE) will not "significantly outperform expectations," thus setting a high bar for a sustained rally.
*   **Capital Allocation:** Management views its ability to generate "strong cash flow" as a key asset, supporting continued shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet.

## Management Record

The analysis of Fox Corporation (FOXA) management for an investor is detailed below:

### **Management Overview and Succession**

1.  **CEO and Executive Leadership:** The company is led by **Lachlan Murdoch** as the Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer, appointed to the role in October 2018 prior to the company's formation. John P. Nallen serves as President and Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Tomsic is the Chief Financial Officer.
2.  **Formation and Management Change:** Fox Corporation was formed in March 2019 as a spin-off of 21st Century Fox's news, sports, and broadcast assets after the film and most entertainment assets were sold to The Walt Disney Company. Lachlan Murdoch was instrumental in this separation, which established the "new Fox" as a standalone, domestic-focused media company.
3.  **Family Control and Succession:** In late 2023, **Rupert Murdoch** stepped down as Chairman of Fox Corporation (and News Corp), transitioning to Chairman Emeritus, a move that consolidated Lachlan Murdoch's control as the sole Chairman of both companies. This resolution ended years of speculation regarding the family's succession plan, providing long-term leadership clarity for investors.
4.  **Management Tenure:** The executive management team is generally experienced, with an average tenure of 5.8 years, indicating stability since the 2019 spin-off.

### **Track Record and Shareholder Value**

5.  **Shareholder Returns:** Under current management, Fox Corporation has delivered strong shareholder value, with a five-year total return of 118.17% and a trailing twelve-month return of 43.13%, which significantly outperformed the S\&P 500.
6.  **Financial Performance:** The company's efficiency and financial strength are highlighted by a Return on Equity (ROE) of 19.59% and a Free Cash Flow (FCF) yield of 11.77%, metrics that underpin the company’s recent stock performance.
7.  **CEO Compensation Alignment:** Lachlan Murdoch’s total compensation is high at \$32.98M, but approximately 85% of his pay is tied to performance metrics such as EBITDA and EPS growth, aligning management incentives with stakeholder value creation.
8.  **Past Controversies:** The company faced a significant legal and reputational challenge with the **Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit**, which resulted in a \$787.5 million settlement in 2023, a key event under Lachlan Murdoch’s leadership.

### **Key Strategic Decisions and Future Vision**

9.  **Core Strategy:** The foundational strategy is a focus on premium **live content**, particularly news (FOX News Media) and sports (FOX Sports), which has been an effective strategy to insulate the company from cord-cutting challenges faced by other media companies.
10. **Digital Expansion (Tubi Acquisition):** A critical strategic decision was the 2020 acquisition of the ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) service **Tubi**. This asset has delivered explosive growth and provides a cost-effective, non-subscription-based approach to the "streaming wars."
11. **Future Vision in Advertising:** Management’s strategy is built for both viewers and advertisers on ad-supported platforms, contrasting with competitors focused on ad-free and subscription models. The company is investing in digital ad-tech solutions, such as the FOXAtlas contextual intelligence platform, to maximize advertiser return on investment across its portfolio.
12. **Content Investment:** Management continues to invest in core programming, successfully leveraging high-profile live events like the Super Bowl to generate massive revenue and promotional opportunities for its other content.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Fox Corporation's (FOXA) management incentive and compensation structure, based on its public filings, reveals a complex mix of high insider control and a highly performance-based compensation model.

### 1. Insider Ownership and Control

1.  **Dual-Class Stock Structure:** Fox Corporation employs a dual-class share structure (Class A non-voting and Class B voting) which concentrates voting power in the hands of the executive team and the Murdoch family, allowing them to control the company with a relatively smaller economic ownership stake compared to the total common stock.
2.  **Concentrated Voting Power:** The Murdoch family, primarily through LGC Holdco, LLC, controls approximately **36.2% of the Class B voting stock**, with Lachlan K. Murdoch retaining sole voting control of this bloc until at least 2050.
3.  **Conclusion on Ownership:** While the economic stake of the general investor public is much larger, the management's long-term **control** is extremely high ("higher the better" for management's stability), which encourages a focus on long-term strategy but also insulates the board and key decisions (like director elections) from outside shareholder dissent.

### 2. Compensation Structure and Alignment

1.  **High At-Risk Pay:** Executive compensation is designed to be largely at-risk, with the CEO's 2024 target total direct compensation consisting of only **13% base salary** and **87% performance-based or at-risk pay**.
2.  **Performance-Based Equity Focus:** A substantial majority of the CEO's regular annual target pay (**70%**) is in **long-term equity incentives**, which primarily consist of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).
3.  **Tied to Shareholder Value:** The PSU awards are explicitly tied to the achievement of annual and three-year financial results, as well as a measure of **relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, directly linking a large portion of pay to the company's stock performance against peers.
4.  **Pay-for-Performance Effectiveness:** The program has demonstrated a strong "pay-for-performance" dynamic, as the executives received **no payout** for the 2022-2024 PSU awards and the first tranche of the 2024-2026 PSUs because the company's performance was below the established threshold goal for the fiscal year 2024.

### 3. Governance and Shareholder Interests

1.  **Risk Mitigation Policies:** The company enforces robust **stock ownership guidelines** for executives and directors and strictly **prohibits hedging and pledging** of company securities. This discourages short-term speculation or excessive risk-taking that could jeopardize their personal stock holdings.
2.  **Capital Return:** The company has a strong record of returning capital to stockholders, having returned over $7.3 billion since its inception, including a growing dividend and a substantial **stock repurchase program** ($5.7 billion repurchased, representing over 27% of total shares outstanding).

### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

Management is highly incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders, particularly those holding the non-voting stock, due to the structure of the compensation program.

*   **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest (High):** The significant portion of compensation tied to PSUs based on financial results and **Relative TSR** (87% at-risk pay), coupled with the proven failure to pay out when targets are missed, creates a strong, direct incentive for long-term value creation. The high level of capital return to shareholders further aligns with general shareholder interests.
*   **Incentive to Line Pockets (Mitigated by Structure):** The dual-class structure allows the family/management to maintain control regardless of broad investor sentiment, which could theoretically allow for prioritizing personal objectives. However, the use of performance-based equity that is clearly *at-risk*, alongside anti-hedging policies, strongly mitigates the risk of executives "lining their pockets" through short-term maneuvering or by insulating themselves from poor company performance.

## Price History

Based on the stock price data and technical analysis available as of the most recent reporting period (late September 2025), here is an analysis of Fox Corporation (FOXA):

1.  **Current Price Status (vs. 52-Week Range):** The stock is currently trading near the top of its 52-week range, with a price of approximately \$63.06, which is close to its 52-week high of \$65.30. This high positioning indicates it is **not** currently trading low based on its yearly price history.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Fox Corporation (FOXA) is currently trading approximately **53.32%** above its 52-week low of \$41.13.

3.  **Technical Analysis Indicators:** Technically, the stock exhibits a bullish signal, as it holds "buy signals" from both its short-term and long-term moving averages. The short-term average trading above the long-term average typically provides a positive forecast.

4.  **Technical Rating:** The stock has received a "High Technical Rating" from Nasdaq Dorsey Wright, further suggesting a strong technical posture rather than a low or oversold condition. Additionally, the stock has strong support near the \$60.62 level.

5.  **Recent Strong Performance ("Up Bigly"):** FOXA has seen a significant upward trend, with its shares gaining 17.8% over a recent three-month period and surging 44.8% over a six-month period, outpacing the Communication Services sector ETF.

6.  **Reasons for the Rise (Fundamentals):** This strong price appreciation is largely attributed to the company's strategic moves, including targeted investments in live sports content and the growing popularity of its ad-supported streaming platform, Tubi. High brand loyalty for flagship networks like FOX News and FOX Sports also contributes to steady advertising revenue.

---

## Long Thesis

Fox Corporation holds the most valuable type of television content: exclusive live news and major sports (like the NFL). This makes its content essential for cable companies and advertisers, giving Fox the power to charge high distribution fees, creating a stable, high-cash-flow business even as cable subscriptions decline. In the near term, the 2024/2025 political election cycle will generate massive advertising revenue that management will use for aggressive share buybacks, directly supporting the stock price. In the long term, Fox is successfully building its future through the free, ad-supported streaming service, Tubi. Tubi is rapidly capturing cord-cutters, providing a major digital growth engine that is funded by the stable cash flow from the legacy TV business, ensuring a profitable transition into the streaming era.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The value of live news and sports remains high enough to allow Fox to raise the price charged to cable providers (affiliate fees) faster than the rate of subscriber cancellations. The free streaming service, Tubi, must maintain its high growth rate and successfully scale to become a primary long-term revenue driver. Fox must retain its exclusive, high-value sports rights, and political advertising spending must remain robust in future election cycles.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This long thesis for Fox Corporation has several critical assumptions that are becoming increasingly strained by market realities. The critique focuses on the escalating costs of live content, the weakening foundation of the core business, and the challenges facing the digital growth engine.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Bull Thesis**

1.  **The Live Content Arbitrage is Becoming Less Profitable:** The core assumption that rising affiliate fees will indefinitely outpace subscriber decline is challenged by recent performance, especially in the cable segment. Cable Network Programming affiliate fee growth has slowed significantly (e.g., to 1-3% in recent quarters), indicating that the escalating rate increases are barely offsetting the accelerating loss of high-value pay-TV subscribers (cord-cutting).

2.  **Escalating Sports Rights Costs are a Major Free Cash Flow Drag:** The thesis highlights the **value** of exclusive sports like the NFL but ignores the rapidly increasing **cost** to retain them. Fox's annual NFL rights fee has nearly doubled, rising to $2.25 billion through 2033. This massive increase in programming rights amortization is a significant, guaranteed expense that can cause substantial headwinds to free cash flow.

3.  **Cyclical Revenue Masks Structural Decline:** The reliance on the 2024/2025 political election cycle for "massive advertising revenue" is a **cyclical tailwind**, not a sustainable structural growth driver. This large but temporary cash injection is being used for share buybacks, which support the stock price but do not solve the underlying, multi-year trend of declining viewership and distribution revenues in the core legacy linear business.

4.  **Tubi's Growth Engine is Largely Detached from Core Assets:** While Tubi's growth in users (97 million MAUs in 2024) and streaming hours is impressive, over 95% of its viewing is on-demand movies and TV, not Fox's premium, high-value live news and sports. This creates a **content silo problem**, where the highly profitable legacy live content is not the primary driver for the future digital business, limiting the synergy and transition strategy.

5.  **Tubi Faces Intense Streaming Competition and Monetization Pressure:** Despite strong growth, Tubi's 10 billion streaming hours in 2024 is dwarfed by the scale of dominant competitors like Netflix, which streamed nearly 100 billion hours in the prior year. Furthermore, Fox's investment in Tubi is actively increasing its overall operating expenses, adding pressure to margins as the company competes in a crowded, low-barrier-to-entry FAST market against deep-pocketed tech and media giants.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Fox Corporation (FOXA)**

1.  **Terminal Decline in Linear Business Accelerates:** Subscriber losses in the pay-TV ecosystem will eventually reach an inflection point where affiliate fee increases can no longer offset the loss of distribution. This will lead to a definitive and accelerating decline in the company's highest-margin, most stable revenue stream, dramatically compressing the valuation multiple of the entire company.

2.  **Content Cost Inflation Outpaces Revenue Growth:** The rapidly escalating expense of retaining core live sports and news rights, exemplified by the nearly doubled cost of the NFL deal, acts as an unavoidable "tax" on the business. This ballooning amortization will continue to erode free cash flow and operating margins, especially when paired with a flattening affiliate revenue line, constraining capital available for new growth initiatives or sustained buybacks.

3.  **The Political Windfall is Temporary and Misleading:** The massive boost from 2024/2025 political advertising is a one-time event that artificially inflates current earnings. Once this cyclical revenue spike passes, the underlying weakness of the core linear business—facing secular advertising declines and continued ratings fragmentation—will become transparent, leading to a significant de-rating of the stock.

4.  **Tubi is a Low-Margin, Unprofitable Diversification:** While Tubi is growing, it is a low-margin advertising business in a highly competitive market, forcing Fox to continuously increase investment and expenses to acquire content and users. The vast majority of Fox's premium content (live sports/news) is not a driver for Tubi, meaning the digital growth engine is a separate, less profitable entity that dilutes overall company margins rather than organically replacing lost revenue from the core linear business.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis and the results from the initial web search (which provided recent Q4 2025 earnings data), the key remaining questions center on quantifying the conflicting forces of cord-cutting/pricing power and the true profitability of the digital transformation.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions to investigate further:

### **I. Quantifying the Core Linear Business Decline (The Bear Case Focus)**

1.  **Long-Term Cord-Cutting Rate vs. Pricing Power:**
    *   **Question:** The Q4 2025 earnings show Cable affiliate fee revenue grew 2% despite subscriber declines "under 7%." This implies price increases are still winning.
    *   **Investigation:** Find an industry-wide average for pay-TV subscriber churn over the last 12-18 months (Q1 2024 to Q4 2025). This will help determine if the **under 7%** decline is accelerating relative to the 2% revenue growth and if the price increases can be sustained across future major contract renewals.

2.  **The True Financial Drag of Sports Rights Amortization:**
    *   **Question:** How much of the **$3.0 Billion Free Cash Flow (FCF) for FY2025** is truly sustainable? The bear case argues that the full amortization impact of the renewed, more expensive NFL deal ($2.25B/year) and other sports rights will significantly erode FCF in future years.
    *   **Investigation:** Search for management's explicit fiscal year 2026 guidance on **Programming Rights Amortization** and its expected impact on Adjusted EBITDA or FCF, specifically isolating the ramp-up from the new NFL contract.

3.  **The Impact of the New FOX ONE Streaming Bundle:**
    *   **Question:** The new FOX ONE bundle launching in August 2025 at $19.99/month is intended for "cord-cutters." Will this service cannibalize highly profitable linear subscribers, or truly capture new "cord-nevers"?
    *   **Investigation:** Look for early analyst commentary or CEO quotes following the launch regarding the **mix of new versus churned subscribers** for FOX ONE, and how the $19.99 price point compares to the per-subscriber affiliate fee Fox currently receives from cable middlemen.

### **II. Deeper Dive into the Digital Growth Engine (Tubi)**

4.  **Tubi's Path to Profitability and Margin Profile:**
    *   **Question:** Tubi generated over \$1 Billion in revenue in FY2025 but is explicitly running at a strategic loss (pre-tax loss was ~$240M in the prior fiscal year).
    *   **Investigation:** Find the management guidance or analyst estimates for the **year Tubi is projected to become profitable (EBITDA positive)**. This will allow for a more accurate discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value the growth asset.

5.  **Digital Content Synergy and Cost:**
    *   **Question:** The bear case argues Tubi content is "detached" from core assets. How is Fox using its core live content (News/Sports clips, analysis shows) to drive high-value viewing on Tubi and its subscription service, FOX Nation?
    *   **Investigation:** Search for recent news on Tubi's content spend, specifically looking for acquisitions or original content development that **integrates** with the Fox News/Sports IP, rather than low-cost library content.

### **III. Valuation and Capital Allocation**

6.  **Comparative Valuation Metrics:**
    *   **Question:** Is the company undervalued given its strong recent performance (118% 5-year return, 12.4 P/E)?
    *   **Investigation:** Perform a comparable analysis (Comps) of FOXA's **EV/EBITDA** and **P/FCF** ratios against its direct media peers (e.g., Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global) and its historical five-year averages to confirm if the current stock price accurately reflects the $3.6B Adjusted EBITDA and $3.0B FCF reported for FY2025.

7.  **Future Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Strategy:**
    *   **Question:** Given the long-term M&A history and the scrapped News Corp merger, does management view their high cash flow ($3B FCF, $5B buyback expansion) as a tool for a major acquisition?
    *   **Investigation:** Search for recent quotes from Lachlan Murdoch (post-Q4 2025) on his outlook for **future M&A activity** to gauge whether the focus will remain on buybacks or shift to external growth.
