This valuation uses the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, relying solely on financial data and forward-looking statements directly from The Kroger Co.'s SEC filings and earnings call transcripts. The valuation is performed in millions of USD, and years represent Kroger's fiscal years (which end in late January/early February of the following calendar year, e.g., FY 2024 ended on February 1, 2025).

## 1. Initial Financial Data

The initial financial figures are taken from The Kroger Co.'s (KR) most recent SEC filings, primarily the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (FY 2023) and subsequent quarterly reports (10-Q) for FY 2024 and Q1 2025.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source/As Of Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,883 | Consolidated Balance Sheet, Feb 3, 2024 |
| **Total Debt** | $17,900 | Total debt (including obligations under finance leases) as of May 24, 2025 (Q1 2025) |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 661.156 | As of June 24, 2025 (in millions) |
| **FY 2024 Net Sales** | $147,100 | Full-year sales for 2024 (52-week basis) |

*Note: The total debt saw a significant increase, likely due to financing activities related to the proposed merger with Albertsons. I will use the latest reported debt figure.*

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Kroger's business engine is driven by **identical sales without fuel (ID Sales)**, which represents organic growth from existing stores, including pricing, volume, and digital sales. Management's strategic focus is on its "Restock Kroger" plan, which emphasizes seamless digital engagement, *Our Brands* (private label) performance, and continued cost savings.

*   **FY 2024 ID Sales w/o Fuel:** 2.4%. This demonstrates strong performance despite a challenging environment.
*   **Digital Sales Growth:** 11% in FY 2024.
*   **Cost Savings:** Management is committed to delivering approximately $1 billion in annual cost savings.

### Revenue Assumptions (FY 2025 - 2030)

I will model the revenue using a conservative, declining ID Sales growth rate, reflecting industry maturity and the economic pressures acknowledged by management, and **excluding** any impact from the proposed Albertsons merger due to regulatory uncertainty, adhering to the instruction to be conservative. The merger could provide a significant revenue and synergy boost, but it is not prudent to include it in a base case DCF.

| Fiscal Year | ID Sales w/o Fuel Growth (ID Sales Driver) | Annual Revenue (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Base)** | 2.4% | $147,100 |
| **FY 2025** | 1.8% | $149,748 |
| **FY 2026** | 1.5% | $151,994 |
| **FY 2027** | 1.2% | $153,818 |
| **FY 2028** | 1.0% | $155,356 |
| **FY 2029** | 0.8% | $156,609 |
| **FY 2030** | 0.7% | $157,685 |

**Justification:** The starting 1.8% for FY 2025 is a conservative step down from the robust 2.4% achieved in FY 2024. This rate is maintained above $0.25\%$ to $1.75\%$ guidance from Q4 2023, reflecting sustained performance from digital and *Our Brands*, but is tapered down toward a conservative $0.7\%$ in the later years to reflect the highly competitive, low-growth nature of the mature US grocery market.

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

Kroger utilizes a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) accounting method for gross margin but must report a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge. I will use management's guided metrics to build the Net Income.

### Margin Assumptions

1.  **Adjusted FIFO Operating Margin:** Based on the FY 2024 Adjusted FIFO Operating Profit guidance of \$4.6 to \$4.7 billion on \$147.1 billion of sales, the margin is approximately $3.13\%$. I will use a conservative initial operating margin of $\mathbf{3.10\%}$ which is slightly below the mid-point of guidance. I will assume this margin *improves by 1 basis point per year* ($\mathbf{0.01\%}$ incremental increase) due to the compounding effect of the $1 billion annual cost savings initiatives and the higher-margin digital and *Our Brands* growth.
2.  **LIFO Charge:** The LIFO charge for FY 2024 was $\mathbf{\$95}$ million. Given lower expected year-over-year inflation, I will assume a stable $\mathbf{\$100}$ million annual LIFO charge for the forecast period, slightly higher than the 2024 charge for conservatism.
3.  **Interest Expense (Net):** Using the **\$17.9 billion** debt figure and assuming a long-term average interest rate of $\mathbf{5.5\%}$ (conservative for a company with an investment-grade rating), the annual interest expense is approximately **\$985 million**. I will keep this flat, as any debt paydown is offset by new leases/capital needs.
4.  **Tax Rate:** Management guided to an adjusted effective tax rate of $\mathbf{22.5\%}$ for FY 2024. I will use this rate.

## 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Cash Flow

Net Income (Line I) is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the DCF model, following the rule that Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year. The additional income component is calculated using ROIC.

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Kroger's retail industry model has a high level of capital employed. Based on historical data, a conservative but reasonable ROIC assumption for future projects is $\mathbf{6.0\%}$. This assumes efficient reinvestment of internally generated cash flow.

*   **Formula:** Net Income for next year = (Projected Net Income) + (Net Income from prior year $\times$ ROIC)

| Metric (in millions USD) | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | FY 2028 | FY 2029 | FY 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income (Projected)** | $2,757 | $2,823 | $2,879 | $2,928 | $2,975 | $3,016 |
| **ROIC Income** | N/A | $165 (2,757 $\times$ 6.0%) | $170 (2,823 $\times$ 6.0%) | $173 (2,879 $\times$ 6.0%) | $176 (2,928 $\times$ 6.0%) | $179 (2,975 $\times$ 6.0%) |
| **Total Cash Flow (DCF Input)** | **$2,757** | **$2,988** | **$3,049** | **$3,101** | **$3,151** | **$3,195** |

## 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** $\mathbf{9.0\%}$. This rate is chosen to reflect Kroger's established, defensive business model (low beta), offset by a reasonable equity risk premium for the current macroeconomic environment and the risk associated with a large, pending merger.
2.  **Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate (Very Conservative):** $\mathbf{1.5\%}$. This rate is conservative, reflecting long-term inflation and real GDP growth well below the U.S. GDP growth average. It assumes Kroger's growth eventually stabilizes at a rate slightly above zero, as is typical for a mature food retailer.

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $2,757 | 0.917 | $2,528 |
| **FY 2026** | $2,988 | 0.842 | $2,516 |
| **FY 2027** | $3,049 | 0.772 | $2,354 |
| **FY 2028** | $3,101 | 0.708 | $2,196 |
| **FY 2029** | $3,151 | 0.650 | $2,048 |
| **FY 2030** | $3,195 | 0.596 | $1,903 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$13,545** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value is the value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   **Terminal Value (2030):** $CF_{2031} / (r - g)$
    *   $CF_{2031} = 3,195 \times (1 + 0.015) = \$3,243$ million
    *   $TV_{2030} = 3,243 / (0.09 - 0.015) = \$43,240$ million
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (Today):** $TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
    *   $NPV(TV) = 43,240 \times 0.596 = \mathbf{\$25,787}$ million

| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | **\$39,332 million** |
| :--- | :--- |
| (Sum of NPV 2025-2030 + NPV of Terminal Value) | (\$13,545 + \$25,787) |

## 6. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value is calculated using the Equity Value approach (Enterprise Value - Net Debt).

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | **$39,332** |
| **ADD: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,883 |
| **LESS: Total Debt** | ($17,900) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$23,315** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 661.156 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$35.26** |

***

## Fair Value and Justification

The calculated fair value of The Kroger Co. (KR) stock is **\$35.26 per share**.

As of the current time (early November 2025), I assume the market price is approximately **\$50.00 per share**.

### Justification of the Difference between Fair Value and Market Price

My calculated Fair Value of **\$35.26** is significantly below the assumed market price of **\$50.00**. This suggests the market is making a large assumption about a high-impact, low-certainty event: **The Albertsons Merger.**

The key discrepancy lies in my conservative and prudent assumption that the valuation must be for the *standalone* Kroger business, excluding the unconfirmed benefits of the pending merger with Albertsons.

**The Market's Assumptions (Why the Market is $\sim42\%$ Higher):**

The market is pricing in a high probability that the **Albertsons merger will close, and its full synergy potential will be realized.**

1.  **Synergy Value:** Management has projected significant cost synergies from the merger, likely in the billions of dollars annually. If a conservative annual synergy of **\$1.5 billion** is realized, taxed at 22.5%, and discounted back, this alone could account for the difference. The market is capitalizing on this promised synergy, which would dramatically increase the long-term cash flows beyond my conservative projections.
2.  **Revenue Growth:** The market assumes the merged entity will achieve a higher, sustained revenue growth rate and greater market share power, leading to higher ID sales growth than the $\sim1\%$ I projected, potentially boosting the terminal growth rate.
3.  **Debt Paydown:** The market may view the $\mathbf{\$17.9}$ billion debt as a temporary bridge to the merger, expecting aggressive post-merger de-leveraging to bring the Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio back into or below the $2.3$ to $2.5$ target range. A lower long-term debt balance would significantly increase the Equity Value.

**My Justification (Why the Conservative Estimate is Correct for a Base Case):**

My valuation of \$35.26 represents the fair value of a **financially strong, but mature, standalone grocery retailer** with a conservative growth trajectory (ID Sales stabilizing at $0.7\%$ terminal growth) and a stable margin profile (slowly improving to $3.15\%$ operating margin).

1.  **Merger Uncertainty:** The merger is an extraordinary event with high regulatory risk, which makes its outcome and full value uncertain. A conservative DCF must exclude this high-risk cash flow until it is certain. Should the merger fail, the stock is likely to trade closer to my intrinsic value of **\$35.26**.
2.  **Conservative Growth Rate:** A long-term terminal growth rate of $1.5\%$ is standard for a mature industry, and the short-term ID sales rate conservatively tapers, avoiding overly optimistic projections in a competitive market.
3.  **Use of Reported Debt:** Using the latest reported debt of $\mathbf{\$17.9}$ billion is crucial. If the merger fails, Kroger is left with a significantly higher debt load than its historical profile, which would pressure the stock price and justify my lower valuation.

**Conclusion:** The market is currently valuing Kroger as a successful, merged entity, capitalizing the expected synergies. My valuation is for the **standalone business**, and the difference between the two valuations represents the **market's perceived net present value of the Albertsons merger and its synergies**, minus the execution and regulatory risk.
