### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Carrier's business engine is transitioning, moving away from lower-margin fire/security and commercial refrigeration segments towards a focus on high-growth, high-margin areas like **Commercial HVAC**, **Data Center Cooling**, and **Aftermarket Services**. This shift is the primary driver for future revenue and margin expansion.

*   **Growth Drivers:**
    *   **Commercial HVAC:** Saw exceptional 30% growth in the Americas in Q3 2025, driven by a strong backlog and favorable market trends.
    *   **Data Center Cooling:** A major secular trend; management expects data center sales to double to $1 billion in 2025, with a backlog extending into 2028. This is a high-growth, strategic vertical.
    *   **Aftermarket/Services:** Experienced double-digit growth, a stable and high-margin revenue stream.
    *   **Headwinds:** The company faces a cyclical downturn in the Americas Residential HVAC market, with sales down 30% in Q3 2025. The European heating market also remains weak.

| Year | Revenue (Billion USD) | Year-over-Year Growth | Rationale (Conservative Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **$22.00** | — | Management Guidance for full-year sales. |
| **2026** | **$22.66** | 3.0% | Management guidance of "low single-digit organic growth". We use a conservative **3.0%** to account for a slow-to-moderate recovery in residential markets and the full impact of portfolio pruning, partially offset by strength in Commercial/Data Center. |
| **2027** | **$23.79** | 5.0% | A step-up in growth as the residential market headwinds abate and the high-growth segments (Data Centers, Commercial HVAC, Aftermarket) gain more weight in the portfolio. This is still below the long-term target of 6-8% for conservatism. |
| **2028** | **$25.22** | 6.0% | The business begins to fully realize the benefits of the portfolio shift and sustained secular growth in Commercial/Data Center. This is at the lower end of the long-term **6-8%** organic growth target and is a conservative long-term rate. |
| **2029** | **$26.73** | 6.0% | Continuation of the strong Commercial and Data Center growth momentum. |
| **2030** | **$28.33** | 6.0% | Continuation of the strong Commercial and Data Center growth momentum. |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

**Net Income Margin Assumption:**

*   **2025 Base Margin:** Based on guidance: Adjusted EPS of $2.65 on 842.2M shares equals a Net Income of $\approx$ $2.23$B. With $22.0$B in revenue, the Net Income Margin is approximately $10.14\%$. I will use a conservative **10.0%** for the base year.
*   **Future Trend:** The company is exiting lower-margin businesses (Commercial Refrigeration) and growing high-margin segments (Aftermarket, Controls, Data Center). I project a conservative, gradual 20 basis point (0.2%) expansion per year, reaching **11.0%** by 2030, in line with the management's focus on margin expansion and productivity improvements.

**ROIC Assumption:**

*   The average ROIC for the last five years (2020-2024) was 8.1%. The latest annualized ROIC (Q3 2025) was 6.68%.
*   A conservative, reasonable ROIC of **7.0%** will be used on the cumulative prior year's Net Income (cash) to generate additional income, as required by the valuation rules.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Inc. Margin (B) | Base Net Income (A * B) | ROIC on Prior Cash (C) | Total Net Income (Base + C) | Cumulative Cash (End of Year) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $22.00 | 10.0% | $2.20 | $0.00 | **$2.20** | $2.20 |
| **2026** | $22.66 | 10.2% | $2.31 | $0.15$ (7.0% on 2.20) | **$2.46** | $4.66 |
| **2027** | $23.79 | 10.4% | $2.47 | $0.33$ (7.0% on 4.66) | **$2.80** | $7.46 |
| **2028** | $25.22 | 10.6% | $2.67 | $0.52$ (7.0% on 7.46) | **$3.19** | $10.65 |
| **2029** | $26.73 | 10.8% | $2.89 | $0.75$ (7.0% on 10.65) | **$3.64** | $14.29 |
| **2030** | $28.33 | 11.0% | $3.12 | $1.00$ (7.0% on 14.29) | **$4.12** | $18.41 |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is a reasonable Cost of Equity/WACC given the current interest rate environment and the company's risk profile, and it is slightly below the reported WACC of 10.29%.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.5%**. This reflects a conservative long-term growth rate, approximating global GDP/inflation, which is appropriate for a mature industrial company like Carrier.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**

*   Terminal Value = (2030 Net Income * (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   Terminal Value = ($4.12B * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.090 - 0.025)
*   Terminal Value = $4.223B / 0.065
*   **Terminal Value = $64.97 Billion**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year | Net Income (A) | Discount Factor (9.0%) (B) | NPV of Cash Flow (A * B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2.20 | 0.917 | $2.02$ |
| **2026** | $2.46 | 0.842 | $2.07$ |
| **2027** | $2.80 | 0.772 | $2.16$ |
| **2028** | $3.19 | 0.708 | $2.26$ |
| **2029** | $3.64 | 0.650 | $2.37$ |
| **2030** | $4.12 | 0.596 | $2.46$ |
| **Terminal Value** | $64.97$ | 0.596 | $38.70$ |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$52.04 Billion** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Billion USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | $52.04 |
| ADD: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $1.423 |
| SUBTRACT: Total Debt | $11.751 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$41.712** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 842.2 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$49.53** |

---

## Final Valuation and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $49.53**

**Current Market Price (Nov 4, 2025): $57.55**

The calculated **Fair Value of $49.53** is **approximately 14% lower** than the Current Market Price of $57.55.

### Justification of Discrepancy

The market is currently pricing CARR at a premium compared to this conservative DCF valuation, which suggests the market is making more optimistic assumptions than those used in this analysis.

| My Conservative Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption | Justification for Market's View |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-Term Growth (6% by 2028)** | **Higher (Closer to 7%-8% or more sustained)** | The market is likely fully buying into the management's long-term **6-8%** organic growth target and believing the **Data Center** and **Commercial HVAC** secular trends will drive sustained, higher growth beyond 2028, offsetting the cyclicality in Residential HVAC. |
| **Discount Rate (9.0%)** | **Lower (Indicating lower risk and/or cost of capital)** | A lower implied cost of equity/WACC in the market's valuation (perhaps 8.0%-8.5%) would close the gap. This suggests the market views the divestiture-led restructuring and focus on climate solutions as a successful derisking strategy, leading to a higher quality, less cyclical revenue stream in the long term. |
| **Net Income Margin (11.0% by 2030)** | **Higher (Closer to 11.5% - 12.0%)** | The market may be projecting a more aggressive margin expansion driven by a faster-than-anticipated mix shift towards high-margin Aftermarket and Controls, better operating leverage on the fixed-cost base, and aggressive cost reduction programs recently announced by management. |
| **ROIC (7.0% on cumulative cash)** | **Higher** | The market may be assuming the company can generate returns closer to its historical average ROIC (8.1% for 2020-2024) or higher, as the new, more focused portfolio will be more capital-efficient. |

**Conclusion:**

My valuation is deliberately conservative, as per the rules, by using a $49.53 fair value, which is below the current market price. The $8.02 difference suggests the market believes Carrier will either achieve the high end of its long-term 6-8% growth target or exceed the conservative margin expansion assumptions due to the significant structural benefits from its portfolio transformation into a more focused, high-growth, and high-margin climate solutions company. I believe my revenue and margin assumptions are reasonable and conservative given the current residential headwinds but the long-term secular tailwinds (Data Center, heat pumps, etc.) which should propel the business into the 6% growth rate. For a purchase decision, one would need to be confident that the company can consistently execute on the higher end of its long-term guidance (7-8% organic growth) and achieve margins well over 11.0% to justify the current stock price.
