## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

NVR's business engine is driven by three primary levers:
1.  **Settlements/Units Sold (Volume):** Determined by the size of the backlog (which is dependent on new orders) and cancellation rates.
2.  **Average Selling Price (ASP):** Price per home settled.
3.  **Gross Margin:** Cost of construction and land relative to the ASP.

### **Business Engine Analysis (Based on last 4 earnings calls/releases):**
The latest results (Q3 2025) show significant headwinds:
*   **New Orders** decreased by 16% year-over-year in Q3 2025 [cite: 1 in step 2].
*   **Backlog Dollars** dropped by 17% to $4.39 Billion [cite: 3 in step 2].
*   **ASP** for new orders is only up 3% to $464,800, indicating limited pricing power [cite: 1 in step 2].
*   **Gross Margin** dropped to 21.0% from 23.4% in Q3 2024 due to high lot costs and pricing pressure [cite: 1 in step 2, 3 in step 2].
*   **Management** expects "continued margin pressure and demand challenges due to affordability and economic volatility" [cite: 6 in step 1].

### **Conservative Revenue Projections**

The model must be conservative, reflecting the ongoing slowdown in the housing market (high interest rates, affordability challenges) and management's caution.

#### **Revenue Projection Model:**

**Year 2025:**
*   9M Revenue: $7.61 Billion [cite: 1 in step 2].
*   Full-Year 2024 Revenue: $10.53 Billion.
*   The business has faced significant Q3 order/backlog drops. Assuming Q4 2025 settlement revenue sees a 10% decline from Q4 2024 ($2.85B in Q4 2024):
    *   Q4 2025 Est. Revenue: $2.85B * (1 - 0.10) = $2.565 Billion.
    *   **FY 2025 Revenue (Est):** $7.61B + $2.565B = **$10.175 Billion** (A conservative ~3.4% YoY decline from $10.53B in 2024).

**Year 2026 - 2030:**
The model assumes a prolonged slowdown followed by a slow recovery, leveraging NVR's superior "land-light" model which allows them to pivot faster than land-heavy competitors.
*   **2026:** Revenue remains flat as macro headwinds and low backlog persist. **0.0% Growth**.
*   **2027:** Start of a slow recovery as interest rates stabilize. **3.0% Growth**.
*   **2028:** Continued modest growth. **4.0% Growth**.
*   **2029 - 2030:** Stabilization toward a conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting population growth and sustained need for housing, but still below peak cycle growth. **4.0% Growth**.

| Year | Projected Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | $10.530 |
| **2025 (Est)** | -3.4% | **$10.175** |
| **2026 (Est)** | 0.0% | **$10.175** |
| **2027 (Est)** | 3.0% | **$10.480** |
| **2028 (Est)** | 4.0% | **$10.899** |
| **2029 (Est)** | 4.0% | **$11.335** |
| **2030 (Est)** | 4.0% | **$11.788** |

## 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

### **Margin Projections**

NVR's average Net Income Margin over 2022-2024 was ~16.5%. With management guiding for continued pressure and the Gross Margin at 21.0% in Q3 2025 [cite: 1 in step 2], I will project a conservative Net Income Margin (NIM) that slowly recovers.

| Year | Projected Net Income Margin (NIM) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 15.95% ($1.68B / $10.53B) | Historical performance. |
| **2025 (Est)** | **14.0%** | Significant reduction due to low 21.0% Gross Margin and pricing pressure. |
| **2026 (Est)** | **14.5%** | Marginal improvement as cost-cutting takes effect. |
| **2027 (Est)** | **15.0%** | Continued slow margin recovery. |
| **2028 (Est)** | **15.5%** | Approaching long-term conservative average. |
| **2029 (Est)** | **16.0%** | Near historical average, but still conservative. |
| **2030 (Est)** | **16.0%** | Conservative long-term margin. |

### **Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) Engine**

The valuation rule requires:
*   Net Income for next year = Projected Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)** assumption: NVR's historical ROIC is exceptionally high (LTM is 32.0% [cite: 1 in step 3], 5-yr average is 31.2% [cite: 1 in step 3]). To be highly conservative for a cyclical industry projection, I will use **20.0%**.

| Year | Projected Revenue ($B) | Projected NIM | Projected Net Income (A) ($B) | ROIC on Prior Year Net Income (B) ($B) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (A+B) ($B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | 10.530 | 15.95% | 1.680 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | 10.175 | 14.0% | **1.425** | 0.336 (1.680 * 20.0%) | 0.909 | **$1.600** |
| **2026** | 10.175 | 14.5% | **1.475** | 0.285 (1.425 * 20.0%) | 0.826 | **$1.458** |
| **2027** | 10.480 | 15.0% | **1.572** | 0.295 (1.475 * 20.0%) | 0.751 | **$1.401** |
| **2028** | 10.899 | 15.5% | **1.689** | 0.314 (1.572 * 20.0%) | 0.683 | **$1.368** |
| **2029** | 11.335 | 16.0% | **1.814** | 0.338 (1.689 * 20.0%) | 0.621 | **$1.331** |
| **2030** | 11.788 | 16.0% | **1.886** | 0.363 (1.814 * 20.0%) | 0.564 | **$1.263** |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | | | |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### **Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**. Given the high historical ROIC, a lower-risk profile, and the strong balance sheet (low debt), a 10.0% discount rate is reasonable.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Perpetual Growth Rate):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative assumption, reflecting long-term US GDP/inflation.

### **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

Terminal Value (TV) reflects the value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).
*   **Free Cash Flow in 2030 (FCF2030):** $1.886B + $0.363B = $2.249 Billion
*   **Terminal Value (2030):** FCF2030 * (1 + Maturity Rate) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   TV = $2.249 Billion * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02)
*   TV = $2.294B / 0.08 = **$28.675 Billion**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $28.675B * 0.564 (Discount Factor for 2030) = **$16.178 Billion**

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Summary**

| Metric | Value (USD Billions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025 - 2030)** | $1.600 + $1.458 + $1.401 + $1.368 + $1.331 + $1.263 = **$8.421** |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | **$16.178** |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $8.421 + $16.178 = **$24.599 Billion** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

**Fair Value of Equity** = Total Enterprise Value + Total Cash & Equivalents - Total Debt

*   Fair Value of Equity = $24.599B + $1.971B - $0.900B
*   **Fair Value of Equity** = **$25.670 Billion**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding

*   Fair Value Per Share = $25,670,000,000 / 2,923,831
*   **Fair Value Per Share** = **$8,779.67**

## 6. Final Valuation and Justification

| Metric | Value (USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **$8,779.67** |
| **Current Market Price (CMP)** | **$7,072.32** |
| **Difference (Undervaluation)** | **24.15%** |

### **Justification for Discrepancy (Model vs. Market)**

My calculated Fair Value of **$8,779.67** is **24.15% higher** than the Current Market Price of $7,072.32.

The market is making a more conservative assumption about the future cash flows of NVR than my already conservative model. The primary reasons for this divergence are likely:

1.  **Macroeconomic and Cyclical Risk:** The market is deeply discounting future cash flows due to the high cyclicality of the homebuilding industry. The current macro environment of high interest rates, leading to significant drops in new orders (-16% in Q3 2025) and backlog (-17% in Q3 2025) [cite: 1 in step 2, 3 in step 2], causes investors to fear a prolonged downturn or a complete halt in growth, forcing them to apply a much higher discount rate or a lower growth assumption than my **10.0% discount rate** and **2.0% maturity rate**.
2.  **Margin Pressure Concern:** The market is concerned that the recent drop in Gross Margin to 21.0% [cite: 1 in step 2, 3 in step 2] is not temporary. My model conservatively projects a slow recovery to 16.0% NIM by 2029. The market may be projecting a lower long-term NIM, perhaps 13.0%-14.0%, or a much slower recovery, especially since management guided for "continued margin pressure" [cite: 6 in step 1].
3.  **ROIC Underestimation:** NVR's historical competitive advantage is its phenomenal ROIC (31%-43% historically) [cite: 1 in step 3, 5 in step 3] stemming from its asset-light model. My model uses an extremely conservative **20.0%** ROIC to reflect its high-quality nature while still being conservative for a valuation. The market may not fully believe this high ROIC is sustainable over the full cycle, thus pricing the stock for a much lower reinvestment return.

**Conclusion:**
The market is currently pricing NVR as a cyclical business with an average competitive advantage facing severe near-term headwinds. My model, while already conservative on growth and margins, still attributes a significant value to NVR's core competitive advantage—its high-return, land-light business model (reflected in the **20.0% ROIC** assumption). If NVR manages to stabilize sales and margins faster than the market expects (a strong possibility given its business model), the fair value of **$8,779.67** will prove accurate. The current stock price represents an attractive entry point for a long-term investor who believes NVR will maintain its superior capital efficiency.
