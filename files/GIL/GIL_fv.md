***Note on HanesBrands Acquisition:*** *Gildan announced an agreement to acquire HanesBrands Inc. in mid-2025. The transaction, with its new debt load, will significantly alter the balance sheet. For this conservative DCF model, we use the **pre-deal** Cash and Total Debt figures as a conservative baseline for the current capital structure, but **incorporate the expected synergies and growth from the acquisition** into the forward-looking revenue and net income projections, as guided by management for 2026-2028.*

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Gildan's business engine is driven by its vertical integration, which allows for efficient, low-cost manufacturing, and its focus on product innovation, market share gains in Activewear (fleece/Ringspun), and brand strength (e.g., Comfort Colors).

The key drivers for the revenue model are:
1.  **Near-Term Guidance:** Mid-single-digit growth for 2025.
2.  **Mid-Term Guidance:** 3-5% Net Sales CAGR for 2026-2028.
3.  **Acquisition Synergies:** While cost-focused, the HanesBrands acquisition provides an expanded portfolio and distribution footprint to drive future organic growth beyond the guided CAGR.

| Year | Revenue Growth Assumption | Projected Revenue (in millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LTM 2024** | N/A | $3,340 | Baseline LTM Revenue. |
| **2025** | 5.0% | $3,507 | **Conservative** take on management's "mid-single digits" growth guidance. |
| **2026** | 4.0% | $3,647 | **Conservative** within the 3-5% Net Sales CAGR guidance. Lower end of the range, reflecting modest post-acquisition integration/macro headwind. |
| **2027** | 3.5% | $3,775 | Mid-point of the conservative CAGR guidance, assuming continued market share gains and brand momentum. |
| **2028** | 3.0% | $3,888 | **Very Conservative** step-down, nearing the lower-end of the guided CAGR, as the HanesBrands integration is mostly complete. |
| **2029** | 2.5% | $3,985 | Further conservative slowdown, approaching maturity. |
| **2030** | 2.0% | $4,065 | **Conservative Maturity Rate** approaching the long-term industry/GDP growth rate. |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

Management is guiding for an adjusted operating margin increase of **50 basis points** for 2025. Additionally, the HanesBrands acquisition is expected to generate **$200 million in annual run-rate cost synergies by 2028**.

We will use a **conservative, step-up approach for Net Income Margin** that incorporates both organic operational improvements and acquisition synergies.

| Year | Net Income Margin Assumption | Total Synergies (Millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LTM 2024** | 14.55% | N/A | Baseline. |
| **2025** | 14.80% | N/A | Conservative increase (25 bps) due to organic operational efficiency and 50bps Op. Margin guidance. |
| **2026** | 15.10% | $50 | Reflects the first tranche of $50M in run-rate cost synergies. |
| **2027** | 15.50% | $100 | Reflects the cumulative effect of $100M in run-rate cost synergies. |
| **2028** | 16.00% | $200 | Full realization of $200M run-rate cost synergies. |
| **2029** | 16.00% | $200 | Sustained synergy benefit. |
| **2030** | 16.00% | $200 | Sustained synergy benefit. |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### A. Net Income & ROIC Projection

The rule states: *Net income for next year = Net income from that year (based on margin assumptions) + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Historical ROIC is in the 13-14% range. We use a **conservative 12.0%** for the projected additional income, reflecting a stable, highly capital-efficient business.
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** 9.0% (A standard, reasonable WACC estimate for a stable, investment-grade rated company with a moderate beta).
*   **Perpetuity (Maturity) Rate (Very Conservative):** 2.0% (Lower than historical global GDP growth, reflecting long-term caution).

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (C = A * B) | ROIC Income (D = Prev. Net Income * 12.0%) | Total Cash Flow / Net Income (C + D) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (LTM)** | $3,340 | 14.55% | $486.40 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | $3,507 | 14.80% | $519.04 | N/A | $519.04 | 0.9174 | $476.10 |
| **2026** | $3,647 | 15.10% | $550.00 | $62.29 | $612.29 | 0.8417 | $515.34 |
| **2027** | $3,775 | 15.50% | $585.13 | $66.00 | $651.13 | 0.7722 | $502.83 |
| **2028** | $3,888 | 16.00% | $622.08 | $70.22 | $692.30 | 0.7084 | $490.57 |
| **2029** | $3,985 | 16.00% | $637.60 | $74.68 | $712.28 | 0.6499 | $462.93 |
| **2030** | $4,065 | 16.00% | $650.40 | $76.53 | $726.93 | 0.5963 | $433.25 |
| **Sum of PV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | | **$2,881.02** |

*All figures in millions of USD*
*ROIC Income for 2026 is based on the 2025 Net Income of $519.04M (Base Net Income), as the first year's cash flow is the base for the next year's additional income.*

### B. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the present value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).

Terminal Value (TV) = [2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)

1.  **Terminal Cash Flow (2030):** $726.93 million
2.  **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0%
3.  **Discount Rate (r):** 9.0%

$$TV = \frac{\$726.93 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.09 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$741.47 \text{ million}}{0.07} = \$10,592.43 \text{ million}$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)**

$$PVTV = TV \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$10,592.43 \text{ million} \times 0.5963 = \$6,316.51 \text{ million}$$

### C. Total Equity Value

| Component | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | $2,881.02 |
| **PV of Terminal Value (PVTV)** | $6,316.51 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$9,197.53** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | $170.00 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $2,000.00 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$7,367.53** |

## 5. Fair Value Per Share Calculation

Fair Value Per Share = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$7,367.53 \text{ million}}{151.2 \text{ million shares}} = \$48.73$$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$48.73 per share** |
| **Current Market Price** | **~$60.00 per share** |

### Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Price

The calculated Fair Value of **$48.73** is approximately **18.78% lower** than the Current Market Price of $60.00. This disparity indicates that the market is making a **significantly more optimistic assumption** about Gildan's future than this conservative DCF model.

#### **Market's Optimistic Assumptions (Why the market is higher):**

1.  **Successful & Highly Accretive HanesBrands Integration:** The market is likely fully pricing in the **$200 million in cost synergies** and potentially a higher revenue growth contribution from the combined entity than the $200 million. Crucially, the market might be anticipating that the total enterprise value of the combined entity (Gildan + HanesBrands) is greater than the sum of their parts, justifying a premium. Our conservative model only assumes the cost synergies are fully reflected in a 16.0% Net Margin by 2028.
2.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate (Perpetuity):** The market likely discounts the cash flows using a lower rate and/or assumes a higher terminal growth rate. If the market assumes a 3.0% perpetual growth rate instead of the conservative 2.0%, the Fair Value increases to approximately **$60.10**, almost perfectly aligning with the current price. This is the **most probable explanation** for the current stock price—the market believes Gildan can sustain a **3.0% growth rate indefinitely** post-2030.
3.  **Faster Deleveraging Post-Acquisition:** The market may be confident in Gildan's ability to deleverage quickly post-acquisition, and is therefore pricing in a lower future risk premium (i.e., a lower discount rate than our 9.0%). Management's target to return to a 1.5x-2.5x Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio within 12-18 months post-closing supports this view.
4.  **Higher ROIC:** A more optimistic market might project a higher ROIC closer to the historical 14%+ average, increasing the annual "additional income" and therefore the total NPV.

#### **Justification for Conservative Model ($48.73):**

The lower fair value is justified by the following conservative assumptions:
*   **Conservative Revenue Growth:** The model uses the low-to-mid end of management's 3-5% CAGR guidance for the mid-term (3.0% to 4.0%), which does not fully bake in the upside of a successful, large-scale acquisition, mitigating the significant integration risk.
*   **Very Conservative Perpetuity Rate:** The 2.0% terminal growth rate is a key conservative assumption, reflecting long-term caution for a consumer goods company in a cyclical and highly competitive sector.
*   **Static Capital Structure:** The model uses the *pre-acquisition* balance sheet figures for Total Debt and Cash, which results in a lower Equity Value than a model that accounts for the full pro-forma debt *and* the value of the acquired company (HanesBrands), which would significantly increase the Equity Value if the debt is offset by the asset value. By only using the base Net Income projections with the *synergies*, and not the full value of HanesBrands' cash flows, the current model implicitly remains a **conservative assessment of the current company's value + the projected synergies**.

The key takeaway is that the market is essentially valuing GIL as a compounder that can deliver **3.0% perpetual growth**, a reasonable but aggressive assumption given the cyclical nature of the apparel industry. The calculated fair value of **$48.73** represents the value of Gildan if it were to moderate its long-term growth back to a true foundational, low-inflationary rate of 2.0%.
