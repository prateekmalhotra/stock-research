## Business Summary

Cable One is a connectivity provider that offers high-speed internet, cable television, and telephone services primarily to residential customers and small businesses. The company differentiates itself by focusing on smaller cities and less densely populated regional markets across the United States where competition is generally lower than in major metropolitan areas. The core of their business model is the ownership and operation of the local network infrastructure, which allows them to deliver these services. The vast majority of the company's revenue now comes from providing high-speed internet (broadband) service, as customers increasingly drop traditional cable TV packages in favor of streaming options.

## Business Model Risk

Cable One faces significant risk associated with heavy capital expenditure, meaning the company must constantly invest huge sums of money to upgrade its networks to prevent them from becoming obsolete. Historically, the main threat was 'cord cutting,' where customers canceled traditional cable TV, forcing the company to pivot entirely toward high-margin internet service. Currently, the most severe near-term threat comes from increased competition from companies rolling out superior fiber optic cable networks or aggressive fixed wireless internet providers (like 5G Home Internet) that are now targeting some of Cable One's smaller, traditionally protected markets. If these new competitors offer faster speeds or lower prices, Cable One's market share and earnings could be significantly harmed, especially if they cannot upgrade their own network infrastructure fast enough to match the technological advances of rivals.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the evolution of Cable One, Inc. (CABO), a major broadband provider that operates primarily under the brand name **Sparklight**.

***

### **The Early Years: From Newspaper Division to Cable TV (1986 - 2005)**

1.  **Original Inception (1986):** The company was originally founded as a subsidiary of the Graham Holdings Company, which at the time owned The Washington Post newspaper, and was initially named Post-Newsweek Cable.
2.  **Founding Purpose:** The initial goal was to provide traditional **cable television services** to various communities across the United States.
3.  **The Name Change (1997):** The company changed its name to Cable One, which it would keep for its corporate identity, even as its customer-facing brand changed later on.
4.  **A Forward-Looking Step (1997):** Cable One began to introduce an innovative product for the time: **broadband internet access** to its cable customers, foreseeing the immense importance of high-speed connectivity.

### **The Strategic Pivot and Shift to Broadband (2006 - 2015)**

5.  **Headwind: The Rise of "Cord-Cutting":** As the 2000s progressed, the company faced a major industry headwind as traditional cable TV became less profitable due to rising programming costs and consumers beginning to "cut the cord" in favor of other entertainment options.
6.  **Innovative Solution: The Broadband Pivot (2006):** In a major strategic move, Cable One began to actively shift its focus from being primarily a cable TV provider to predominantly a **broadband internet provider**.
7.  **The New Core Focus:** This new strategy involved intentionally de-emphasizing the declining video business and aggressively channeling resources and investment into its high-speed data (internet) and business services, which offered much higher profit margins.
8.  **Becoming Independent (2015):** The company officially became a fully independent, publicly-traded entity on the New York Stock Exchange, separating from its parent company, Graham Holdings Company.

### **Growth, Rebranding, and Modernization (2016 - Present)**

9.  **Key Tailwinds: A Unique Market Position:** A significant tailwind for Cable One was its focus on serving smaller, non-metropolitan, and secondary markets, where it often had little or no direct competition from other high-speed wired providers.
10. **Innovative Solution: Growth by Acquisition:** To expand its advantageous footprint, Cable One executed strategic acquisitions, such as purchasing NewWave Communications in 2017, which brought more customers and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.
11. **Innovative Solution: Brand Modernization (2019):** To better reflect its current business focus on fast internet, the company completely rebranded its residential services to **Sparklight** (and later consolidated other acquisitions under this umbrella). The new name, which suggests "speed and connectivity," was designed to separate it from its history as a traditional cable TV company.
12. **Headwind: New Competitive Threats:** In recent years, a strong headwind has emerged with increasing competition from rival companies aggressively building new **fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)** networks and the rapid expansion of **fixed wireless internet** (like from wireless carriers).
13. **Innovative Solution: Network Upgrades and Future-Proofing:** To combat competition, Cable One has committed to continuous network investments, utilizing technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 and 4.0 to dramatically increase speeds on their existing cable lines and aggressively expanding their own Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployments.
14. **Headwind: Financial Pressures:** The more competitive environment, coupled with rising interest rates, has caused subscriber growth to slow and pressured revenues and profits in 2024 and 2025.
15. **Current Strategy:** The company responded to these headwinds by cutting its dividend to prioritize **debt reduction** and is focusing on localized, personalized product offerings to both retain its most valuable customers and attract new, more value-conscious customers.

### **The Company's Goal Today**

16. **Current Business Goal:** Cable One's ultimate goal is to connect over a million customers (residential and business) across 24 states by being the most trusted provider of **superior broadband communications services**, primarily high-speed internet.
17. **Simple Goal in Simple English:** The company is transforming from a traditional cable TV provider into an essential, high-speed internet utility for smaller cities and towns, aiming for reliable, high-margin, long-term growth by prioritizing data services and expanding its fiber-powered network.

## Moat Analysis

Cable One, Inc. (CABO) built its business around a strong and structural moat, primarily by focusing its efforts on markets that larger competitors typically avoid. This strategy created significant advantages, though the moat is now facing new challenges from next-generation technologies.

### The Moat of Cable One (CABO)

1.  **Geographic Moat/Local Monopoly:** Cable One's primary advantage is its deliberate focus on non-metropolitan, secondary, and tertiary markets (rural and suburban areas). This strategic choice means the company often operates as a practical monopolist or a duopolist in its service areas, facing much less competition compared to major city markets served by rivals like Comcast and Charter.

2.  **High Barrier to Entry (Capital Investment):** The existing, in-place hybrid fiber-coaxial network represents a high up-front capital cost that a new competitor must replicate to enter the market. Building a new parallel infrastructure in dispersed rural and suburban areas is financially prohibitive, which has historically protected Cable One's market share and allowed for stable cash flow generation.

3.  **Sticky, Recurring Revenue:** Broadband internet service is an essential utility, not a one-time purchase, ensuring customer contracts are highly sticky and recurring. This essential nature of the service, combined with the lack of comparable alternatives in many of their markets, contributes to lower customer turnover (churn rates).

### Special Position, Differentiation, and Pricing Power

4.  **Differentiation through Market Choice:** Cable One differentiates itself by serving the "unwanted" markets, allowing it to escape the fierce pricing wars and high customer acquisition costs of major metropolitan areas.

5.  **Significant Pricing Power:** The lack of robust competition in its core markets grants Cable One significant pricing power, allowing it to maintain a high Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) for its residential data services. Reports have suggested that the effective monopoly in some rural areas has led to very high prices for consumers.

6.  **Growth from a "Broadband-First" Strategy:** The company's growth into what it is today stemmed from its strategic transition years ago to prioritize high-speed data services over traditional, declining video services. This focus on the highest-margin product (broadband) in less competitive markets fueled its financial performance.

### Displacement Risk and Moat Defense

7.  **Vulnerability to Capital-Rich Competitors:** Displacement by a capital-rich competitor is a growing risk, as rising competition from Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) overbuilders, wireless internet providers, and even satellite services like Starlink is increasing, particularly in half of Cable One's markets. FTTH is a superior technology to Cable Oneâ€™s current infrastructure, and major capital investments are required to upgrade the network to remain competitive.

8.  **Network Effects are Structural, Not Social:** The company's primary advantage is a **structural** barrier (the cost of the physical network) rather than a traditional social network effect (where the service's value increases with each new user). The localized infrastructure creates a geographic and financial advantage that new entrants find difficult to overcome, acting like a local utility.

9.  **Proactive Moat Defense via Investment and Innovation:** To maintain its edge, Cable One must and does constantly invest and innovate.
    *   **R&D and Innovation:** The company allocated **\$45.3 million to research and development in 2023**, focusing on next-generation broadband technologies, advanced cybersecurity, and AI-driven network management.
    *   **Network Upgrades:** The company is actively investing in network upgrades, including expanding Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployments and DOCSIS 4.0 technology, to expand capacity and compete with new fiber entrants.
    *   **Acquisitions:** Cable One has also strategically expanded its reach and consolidated its power through a series of acquisitions of complementary assets in underserved markets.

## Catalyst Analysis

Cable One, Inc. (CABO) is focusing on cost management, capital efficiency, and strategic investment to counter competitive pressures from fiber and fixed wireless providers. The following are the key catalysts that could impact the stock price.

### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Lower Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** The company is benefiting from prior network investments, with capital expenditures having been on a downward trend for two years and expected to continue declining. This reduction in spending on upgrades like DOCSIS 4.0 directly increases the company's free cash flow (Adjusted EBITDA minus CapEx).
2.  **Stabilization of Residential Data Metrics:** Management has stated optimism about achieving broadband revenue growth over the coming year and noted that residential data Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) has shown signs of stabilization in recent quarters after earlier declines. A confirmed halt in subscriber losses or a return to modest subscriber growth would be a significant positive catalyst.
3.  **Debt Reduction and Improved Financial Flexibility:** In the first quarter of 2025, the company announced the suspension of its quarterly cash dividend to save approximately $67 million annually, which will be redirected toward debt reduction and growth initiatives. While initially viewed negatively by dividend investors, this focus on deleveraging is intended to strengthen the balance sheet and free up capital for strategic investments.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Growth in Business Services:** Cable One's business data revenues continue to grow, driven by demand in the carrier, wholesale, and enterprise segments. Management highlights this as a source of healthy growth that can offset residential challenges.
2.  **Strategic and Operational Integration:** The company is consolidating its various operating brands under the single **Sparklight** brand and implementing a new, unified billing system. Management anticipates that these operational enhancements, which also include a full-court press on integrations, will lead to better cost-effectiveness and an improved customer experience.
3.  **Network and Product Innovation:** Continued investment in "leading intelligent Wi-Fi technology" and the deployment of updated network architecture are intended to maintain a competitive advantage by offering higher speeds and better in-home connectivity. This strategy aims to improve the customer journey and retention, particularly against fiber competitors.
4.  **CEO Succession Plan:** The announced retirement of CEO Julia Laulis, effective at the end of 2025, introduces near-term uncertainty, but the appointment of a new CEO with a fresh strategy for competing in the current market could act as a long-term catalyst.

## Management Record

Based on public information and recent financial reports, here is an analysis of the management of Cable One, Inc. (CABO) for an investor.

### Cable One Management Analysis (CABO)

#### **1. CEO Background, History, and Tenure**

1.  The current Chair of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer is Julia M. Laulis (also known as Julie Laulis), who will be retiring by the end of 2025 or upon the appointment of her successor.
2.  Ms. Laulis has an extensive, long-term history with the company, having joined Cable One in 1999 and holding various key operational and marketing positions, including Chief Operating Officer, before becoming CEO in 2017.
3.  The transition to Laulis's leadership in 2017 was a smooth internal succession, following the retirement of her predecessor, Thomas O. Might, who had served as CEO for nearly 25 years.

#### **2. Track Record and Key Decisions (Pre-2023 Performance)**

1.  For several years after the company's 2015 spin-off, management successfully shifted its strategic focus to high-speed data (HSD) and business services, driving compounded annual revenue growth for both segments.
2.  Under Laulis's direction, the company rebranded its consumer-facing business to Sparklight and expanded its footprint through significant strategic acquisitions, including Hargray and Fidelity.
3.  Management demonstrated a strong focus on margin expansion, successfully growing its Adjusted EBITDA margin from 39% at the time of the spin to over 53% by mid-2021, and its enterprise value grew over 400% from the spin-off to Q2 2021.

#### **3. Management Performance and Credibility (Recent Challenges)**

1.  Recent performance has led to a significant loss of investor confidence, with Q1 2025 results revealing a 5.9% revenue drop, a 93% collapse in net income, and a loss of residential data subscribers.
2.  The company's stock has suffered major losses, with the share price declining over 60% year-to-date as of June 2025 and trading near its 52-week low.
3.  Managementâ€™s abrupt decision to suspend its 14-year streak of quarterly cash dividends was met with a severe investor backlash, triggering a 41% single-day stock plunge and leading analysts to cite a "credibility crisis."

#### **4. Future Strategy and Vision**

1.  The core strategy remains a multi-year plan for profitable growth, which centers on expanding the higher-margin residential data and business data services while phasing out the lower-margin residential video business.
2.  The company is committed to increasing network capacity and coverage through continued investment in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployments and improving overall infrastructure.
3.  In response to new competition from fixed wireless access (FWA), management is introducing a prepaid broadband product ("Flex Connect") and other personalized products to stabilize and grow customer units, particularly in the value-conscious segment.

#### **5. Leadership and Popularity**

1.  The company is currently undergoing a critical CEO succession process, with the Board actively searching for a replacement, considering both internal and external candidates.
2.  The executive team's "popularity" among employees appears low; a third-party report rated the Executive Team a "D," placing it in the bottom 15% of similar-sized companies.
3.  The dividend suspension, which was framed as a strategic move to save $67 million annually for debt reduction, is a key point of contention with the shareholder base, suggesting an expected "shareholder base turnover" as income investors exit the stock.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available information, primarily from Cable One, Inc.'s (CABO) proxy statements (DEF 14A) and related filings, the following points address the management incentive and compensation structure:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Cable One, Inc. (CABO)**

1.  **High Insider/Major Shareholder Alignment (A Strong Positive):** The company benefits from a very substantial insider holding by director Donald Graham, who owns 14.37% of the stock, which is a strong indicator of long-term alignment between a major investor and shareholders' interests.

2.  **Management Stock Ownership:** Named Executive Officers (NEOs) and directors hold shares and are subject to robust **stock ownership guidelines** and **holding guidelines**, meaning management must build and retain a meaningful equity stake in the company, which ties their personal wealth directly to stock price performance.

3.  **Performance-Based Pay Structure:** The executive compensation program is designed to be performance-based, utilizing a mix of base salary, annual cash incentives, and a significant portion of long-term incentive (LTI) equity awards, such as Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Performance Share Units (PSUs), and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

4.  **Key Performance Metrics (Linking Pay to Operations):** The incentive compensation is tied to key financial and operating metrics, including **Adjusted EBITDA** for the annual cash incentive and metrics like **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** and **Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures** for the long-term incentive awards.

5.  **Mitigating Risk and Misconduct:** The compensation plan includes important governance mechanisms such as a **Clawback Policy**, which allows the company to recoup or forfeit incentive compensation (cash bonuses and equity) in the event of financial restatements, legal/compliance violations, or executive misconduct.

6.  **Potential Compensation Concern (High Compensation):** A point of potential contention is that the CEO's total compensation (\$8.04M) has been noted as significantly above the average for similar-sized companies in the US market (\$3.50M), which could raise questions about compensation competitiveness and the rigor of target setting.

***

### **Conclusion: Alignment with Shareholder Interests**

Cable One's management is generally incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders, driven primarily by the following factors:

*   **Strong Alignment from Major Shareholder:** The large insider ownership of 14.37% by a key individual (Donald Graham) provides an inherent, powerful incentive for sound governance and long-term value creation, as their wealth is directly linked to the company's stock performance.
*   **Emphasis on Long-Term Equity:** The compensation structure's heavy reliance on long-term equity awards (PSUs, PSAs, RSUs) that vest over multiple years and are tied to operating metrics like ROIC and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures ensures executives are focused on sustainable operational and capital efficiency improvements, not just short-term gains.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The mandatory stock ownership guidelines and the clawback policy reinforce accountability and deter excessive risk-taking or personal pocket-lining by requiring executives to hold stock and penalizing misconduct.

The structure suggests that executives are rewarded for creating shareholder value through operational performance and stock appreciation, rather than being incentivized to just "line their own pockets" through excessive cash bonuses or easily attained short-term targets.

## Price History

Based on a review of recent price data and technical analysis from financial sources:

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The Cable One, Inc. (CABO) stock price as of mid-October 2025 is approximately **$155.48**. This is near the lower end of its 52-week trading range of **$117.54** to **$437.00**.
2.  **Position Relative to 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **32.28%** above its 52-week low of $117.54.
3.  **Overall Price Trend (Big Drop):** The stock has experienced a massive drop, decreasing by over **51%** over the last year (as of July 2025). This dramatic fall reflects a significant downtrend that has brought the price into a low range.
4.  **Technical Analysis Signals:** Technical indicators are mixed but generally bearish. Many short and long-term Moving Averages are issuing **sell signals**, and the overall technical rating on TradingView and other sites often points to a "sell" or "strong sell," suggesting a continuation of the negative trend in the near term. However, some daily analyses contradict this, showing "Strong Buy" signals.
5.  **Reason for Big Drop (Fundamental Issues):** The substantial decline is fundamentally driven by poor business performance, including reports of **sluggish subscriber trends**, a projected **sales decline**, and navigating **revenue declines** in recent quarters. The company reported a significant net loss ($-437.98 million USD) in its last quarter.
6.  **Trading Low Assessment:** While the stock is more than 30% above its absolute low, its price is dramatically lower than its 52-week high of $437.00. The price action and prevailing technical sell signals suggest the stock is trading in a significantly **depressed range**, which some analysts see as undervalued with potential growth if operational performance improves.

## Long Thesis

Cable One is a crucial high-speed internet provider (a utility) for smaller towns and less populated areas, where it often faces less competition than its larger rivals. The stock is currently trading at a deeply depressed price because new fiber and wireless competitors have temporarily caused the company to lose subscribers. The bull case is that this competitive pain is temporary. Management is aggressively cutting its shareholder dividend to save cash for two critical things: paying down debt and massively investing in network upgrades (like fiber) to match or beat competitor speeds. If these proactive defenses successfully stabilize the customer base and halt subscriber losses, Cable One's core businessâ€”selling high-margin internet in protected marketsâ€”will quickly regain its status as a robust cash-flow engine. Since the stock price already reflects the worst-case scenario (a 51% drop), any operational success in stabilizing customer counts will lead to a significant recovery in the share price, especially as financial flexibility improves due to debt reduction.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The company's expensive network upgrades (Fiber-to-the-Home and DOCSIS 4.0) must successfully match the speeds offered by new competitors. New rivals (fiber overbuilders and fixed wireless) must not escalate their market invasion beyond current levels. The cash saved by cutting the dividend must successfully reduce debt and stabilize the balance sheet, restoring investor confidence. Finally, the eventual appointment of a new CEO must bring fresh strategy and renewed focus that successfully reverses the recent trend of customer losses.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Cable One, Inc. (CABO) contains several critical assumptions that are contradicted or materially challenged by recent facts, forming the basis for a strong bear case.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Bull Case Thesis**

1.  **Competitive Pain May Not Be Temporary, But Structural:** The bull case assumes subscriber loss is a temporary "blip," but residential data subscriber decline is an ongoing issue, down 3.2% year-over-year in Q2 2025. This, combined with Cable One's higher average residential broadband price ($\sim\$80$) compared to competitors like Fixed Wireless Access ($\sim\$50$), suggests a deep, structural disadvantage that its high-priced offering is not competitive in the new landscape.

2.  **Impairment Charge Challenges "Worst-Case Scenario" Pricing:** The stock price may not fully reflect the worst-case scenario, as the company reported a massive **\$456.2 million non-cash asset impairment charge** in Q2 2025, resulting in a net loss of \$438.0 million. This suggests the company's own asset valuation and the value of its protected markets are significantly deteriorating, a far worse operational reality than temporary subscriber losses.

3.  **Network Upgrade Costs vs. Debt Burden:** The thesis relies on "massive investment" in upgrades to match competitors, but capital expenditures remain high (up 8% in Q1 2025) which drains cash flow needed to service the company's still-substantial debt of approximately \$3.50 billion. The high-stakes bet on upgrades comes at a significant financial cost in an environment of declining revenue.

4.  **"Robust Cash-Flow Engine" Is Deteriorating:** While the company's adjusted EBITDA margin remains strong, the actual cash flow and profitability have suffered a sharp decline, with total revenues falling 3.4% year-over-year and residential data revenues also declining. This challenges the assertion that the core business will "quickly regain its status as a robust cash-flow engine."

5.  **CEO Transition is a Risk, Not a Guaranteed Catalyst:** The bull case treats the new CEO's appointment as a guaranteed catalyst for "fresh strategy and renewed focus." However, the sitting CEO announced her retirement by the end of 2025 with a successor search underway, and the transition period is formally cited as a significant business risk that could lead to shifts in strategy and impact financial results.

### **Bear Case Thesis**

The bear case for Cable One is that its historical business model of operating a high-margin internet "utility" in protected, smaller markets is fundamentally broken by the dual threat of aggressive competition, which will permanently compress margins and market share.

1.  **Permanent Margin and Market Compression:** The high-margin business in "protected markets" is over, as fiber overbuilders and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) providers continue to aggressively target CABOâ€™s footprint with superior (fiber) or lower-cost (FWA) products. This leads to sustained subscriber losses and forces the company to either lower its high prices or increase CAPEX significantly, permanently compressing its industry-leading operating margins.

2.  **Debt and Execution Risk:** The company's strategy of funding massive, multi-year network upgrades (Fiber-to-the-Home and DOCSIS 4.0) by cutting the dividend puts high execution pressure on a company with a high net leverage ratio of 4.1x and declining revenue. If the expensive upgrades fail to stabilize the customer count quickly, the debt burden will become increasingly difficult to manage as cash flow and profitability shrink.

3.  **Valuation Reset to a Declining Cable Multiple:** Cable One no longer trades as a high-growth, high-margin, protected utility; it is now a declining, highly-leveraged cable operator facing significant capital expenditure requirements and a leadership transition. The market will continue to re-rate the stock, moving its valuation multiple lower to reflect its new status as a struggling, high-risk turnaround play, making a "significant recovery" unlikely until operational success is demonstrated over several quarters.

---

## Next Steps

The existing analysis is comprehensive, clearly outlining the bull and bear cases, with the core conflict being the severity of competition versus the success of the CapEx and debt-reduction plan.

The initial search provided critical details about the massive impairment charge and current valuation multiples.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should investigate:

### **Next Steps to Investigate for Cable One (CABO)**

1.  **Quantify the Competitive Threat by Market:**
    *   The analysis confirms that the $\text{\$456.2 million}$ impairment charge in Q2 2025 was due to a decline in stock price triggering a reassessment of **goodwill and intangible assets (franchise agreements)**, suggesting the value of the "protected markets" is deteriorating.
    *   **Action:** Investigate which *specific geographic segments* or *past acquisitions* (e.g., Hargray, Fidelity) the goodwill/franchise impairment charge is attributed to. This will pinpoint exactly where the "protected markets" are no longer protected.

2.  **Evaluate the Execution of Network Upgrades (Fiber/DOCSIS 4.0):**
    *   The bull case hinges on network upgrades. Management stated in March 2025 that prior DOCSIS 4.0 investments would lead to a downward trend in CapEx. Q2 2025 CapEx was slightly down year-over-year.
    *   **Action:** Search for the *latest quantified metrics* on the network rollout:
        *   How many **Homes Passed by Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)** did Cable One add in the last quarter (Q2/Q3 2025)?
        *   What is the **current footprint of the new high-speed DOCSIS 4.0 service**? (e.g., how many homes are eligible for multi-gig speeds?)

3.  **Analyze Current Valuation and Peer Comparisons (Dig Deeper):**
    *   The current EV/EBITDA is around **4.7x to 5.33x**, which is historically very low for CABO (median over 13 years was 12.02x) and even lower than major cable peers like Comcast and Charter. The bear case suggests this is a permanent "declining cable multiple."
    *   **Action:** Get the most recent **EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and Free Cash Flow (FCF) multiples for primary peers** (e.g., Charter Communications/CHTR, Comcast/CMCSA, and rural-focused fiber builders if possible) to definitively prove or disprove the valuation reset thesis.

4.  **Track the CEO Succession Process:**
    *   The retirement of CEO Julie Laulis at the end of 2025 is a major long-term risk and a potential catalyst.
    *   **Action:** Search for any recent news or press releases regarding the **CEO search committee, timeline, or identified internal/external candidates**. The identity and background of the new CEO will be the single most important long-term factor.

5.  **Unpack the Impact of New Competitive Products:**
    *   The company is introducing new products like "Flex Connect" (prepaid broadband) [cite: Management record].
    *   **Action:** Investigate the **pricing and specific speed tiers** of these new competitive products. Are they genuinely competing with the $\text{\$50}$ Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) plans, or are they still attempting to maintain the high Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) that the bear case suggests is unsustainable?
