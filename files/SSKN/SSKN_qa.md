## Business Summary

STRATA Skin Sciences is a business-to-business (B2B) company that provides advanced medical equipment, mainly specialized light therapy machines like the XTRAC laser, to dermatology and medical offices primarily within the United States. These machines treat common chronic skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo. The core business model operates similarly to a ‘razor and blade’ approach: while the company earns some revenue from selling the initial laser machine, the majority of their recurring, predictable revenue comes from the ongoing sale of consumable parts (like disposable handpieces) and service contracts required to keep the machines operating. This strategy ensures doctors are continually reliant on STRATA for supplies, driving sustained sales based on how often the devices are used for patient treatments.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk is the dependence on favorable insurance reimbursement policies. If major insurance providers decide to reduce the amount they pay doctors for light therapy treatments, or place stricter rules on coverage, physicians may stop using STRATA’s machines, immediately hurting the company’s recurring revenue from consumables. This has been a recurring threat in the medical industry, as insurers frequently seek ways to lower costs. A long-term risk involves intense competition and technological obsolescence. If competitors introduce new drug treatments or alternative light therapies that are cheaper or proven to be more effective than STRATA’s current devices, the market position of STRATA’s products could quickly erode, forcing the company to invest heavily in research and development to keep up, potentially harming earnings and market share.

## Company History

This history of STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. (SSKN) is simplified and jargon-free to help you understand the company's journey from its beginnings to its current mission.

### **The Early Years: Inception and Initial Purpose**

1.  **Inception (1989) and Early Focus:** The company was originally founded in 1989 under the name Electro-Optical Sciences, Inc., and later operated as MELA Sciences, Inc.
2.  **The Original Business Goal:** The initial focus was on developing non-invasive tools to assist dermatologists in the examination of skin for signs of melanoma (a serious form of skin cancer). Their first main product was a system called MelaFind.
3.  **The First Big Problem (Discontinued Product):** The company’s original core product, MelaFind, did not become the market success they had hoped for, leading the company to eventually discontinue that business line entirely. This suggested the company needed a major strategic shift to survive.

### **The Pivotal Shift: Becoming STRATA Skin Sciences**

4.  **The Game-Changing Acquisition (2015):** The major turning point came in June 2015 when the company acquired the key assets of the XTRAC and VTRAC businesses from PhotoMedex, Inc.
5.  **The Birth of STRATA Skin Sciences (2016):** Following this acquisition, the company officially changed its name to STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. in January 2016 to reflect its new, clear focus.
6.  **The New Core Goal:** STRATA's mission shifted completely from skin cancer *detection* to the development and commercialization of advanced light-based products for the *treatment* of chronic skin diseases like psoriasis and vitiligo.

### **Innovative Solutions and Business Model**

7.  **The Flagship Innovative Solution (XTRAC Laser):** The core of the company became the XTRAC Excimer Laser System, a device that delivers a highly targeted beam of ultraviolet B (UVB) light to treat localized patches of conditions like psoriasis and vitiligo.
8.  **The Unique Business Model ("The Partnership Program"):** To help more dermatology practices use the expensive equipment, STRATA created a unique, innovative model in the U.S. called the Partnership Program. Instead of clinics having to buy the machine outright, STRATA provides the laser and charges a fee for each patient treatment performed. This lowers the initial cost barrier for doctors.
9.  **Marketing Innovation (Direct-to-Consumer):** STRATA uses targeted advertising (Direct-to-Consumer, or DTC) to educate patients about XTRAC treatment. They then help patients get insurance approval and direct them to their partner clinics, which helps drive patient volume and revenue for both STRATA and the doctors.

### **Headwinds and Tailwinds (Challenges and Advantages)**

10. **Significant Tailwind (Eliminating Competition):** In 2021, STRATA acquired the Pharos excimer laser business from a key competitor (Ra Medical Systems). This move significantly increased their total number of devices in use and firmly established STRATA as the leading provider of excimer laser treatments in the U.S. market.
11. **Headwind (Financial Strain):** The company has dealt with financial difficulties and the persistent challenge of achieving consistent profitability, sometimes having to raise new capital and receiving notices regarding Nasdaq listing requirements.
12. **Headwind (Competitive and Legal Battles):** STRATA has also faced headwinds from competitors, including ongoing legal challenges (like the recent litigation against LaserOptek) to protect its proprietary technology and market position from competitors that may be using misleading claims.
13. **Massive Future Tailwind (Insurance Code Expansion):** A key advantage for future growth is the planned historic expansion of government insurance codes (CPT codes) for the XTRAC laser. This change, expected by 2027, will allow the treatment to be reimbursed for up to 30 additional skin conditions, potentially expanding the available patient population significantly.

### **STRATA Today: The Current Goal**

14. **Current Focus:** Today, STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. is a focused medical technology company primarily known for its XTRAC laser. Its goal is to provide dermatologists with clinically proven, non-surgical treatment options and to make these treatments accessible to patients suffering from chronic, life-altering skin conditions.

## Moat Analysis

Based on the company's business model, regulatory advantages, and unique service offering, here is an analysis of the moat for STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. (SSKN), primarily centered around its XTRAC excimer laser system.

### Moat and Differentiation Analysis of STRATA Skin Sciences (SSKN)

#### 1. Sticky, Recurring Revenue Model (The Partnership Program)
*   **Customer Contracts are Sticky:** STRATA's primary business differentiator is its unique "Partnership Program" where it places the XTRAC laser system in a dermatologist's office for a fee-per-treatment cost structure, instead of a large, one-time equipment purchase.
*   **Recurring Revenue:** This model creates sticky, recurring revenue, as the company is paid each time the device is used for a patient treatment. This ensures that the contracts are not just one-time sales but a continuous stream of income tied to the number of procedures performed.
*   **Value-Added Services:** The partnership also includes installation, staff training, full service and maintenance of the equipment, and even co-op advertising to help the clinic find patients. This high level of support and low upfront cost for the clinic makes it difficult for a competitor to displace the installed device.

#### 2. Unique Regulatory and Reimbursement Advantage
*   **Special Position in the Market:** The XTRAC laser is positioned as the standard in targeted UVB therapy, and its treatments are covered by a specific set of CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes, which dictate insurance reimbursement.
*   **Massive Market Expansion:** The company is set to benefit from a significant upcoming revision to the CPT codes (effective as early as 2026/2027), which is expected to triple its addressable patient market to over 30 million by including more chronic skin conditions like atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata under the reimbursable umbrella.
*   **Pricing Power/Market Access:** This regulatory advantage is a form of special market position and pricing power. It ensures that treatments performed on their devices are eligible for insurance coverage, which is a critical factor for dermatologists, making their technology a preferred, financially viable choice.

#### 3. Intellectual Property (IP) and Legal Defensibility
*   **IP Protection:** STRATA actively pursues litigation to protect its intellectual property, which management views as a layer of defensibility and a tool for market consolidation.
*   **Competitive Barrier:** This legal strength against competitors who may attempt to infringe on their patents helps reinforce their position as a long-term leader in the excimer laser market, forcing other companies to create truly different, non-infringing technology.

#### 4. Ease of Displacement
*   **Hard to Displace:** While STRATA is a relatively small company with financial challenges (such as negative net income), its specialized moat makes it challenging for a competitor, even one with significantly more capital, to easily displace.
*   **Capital Needs Beyond R&D:** A competitor would need not only a technically superior laser but would also have to:
    *   Break the existing sticky, recurring partnership contracts with dermatologists.
    *   Navigate the complex, multi-year process of securing its own favorable CPT reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

#### 5. R&D and Innovation
*   **Need for Constant Innovation:** The company does invest in product development and has an innovative approach, such as introducing the TheraClearX acne system and focusing on combination therapies (XTRAC with topical drugs) to maintain a treatment edge.
*   **Focus on Clinical and Reimbursement Edge:** While the company's financial results show a focus on improving operational efficiency and increasing gross margins from recurring revenue, the primary strategic 'innovation' in recent years has been securing expanded reimbursement (the CPT codes), which has been the biggest reason for potential future growth.

## Catalyst Analysis

The stock catalysts for STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. (SSKN) are primarily driven by expansion in reimbursement, growth in its recurring revenue model, and market penetration, as highlighted in recent company releases and earnings calls.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Within 12 Months)**

1.  **Elevate 360 Program Success:** The company's management is focusing on its consulting program, which helps partner clinics improve their operations. Clinics adopting this program have reported an average year-over-year growth of $7\%$, with gross billings per device increasing by $8.5\%$, which is a direct driver of the company's recurring revenue.
2.  **Growth in Recurring Revenue:** Net U.S. recurring revenue from its core product, the XTRAC laser, grew by $2.8\%$ in the third quarter of 2025, while global recurring revenue increased by $3\%$. This recurring revenue model provides a stable and predictable income base.
3.  **International Expansion:** The company is expanding the availability of its products outside the U.S. A recent example is the regulatory clearance and initial commercial placements of its TheraClear®X Acne Therapy System in Mexico, which opens a new international market.
4.  **Successful Litigation and Market Reclaim:** The company secured a legal victory that resulted in an injunction against a competitor, which allowed 20 clinics to return to STRATA, contributing over \$1 million in annual revenue.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)**

1.  **Significant Reimbursement Expansion (Management's Key Focus):** The most significant long-term catalyst is the historic expansion of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for the XTRAC 308-nanometer excimer laser, set to take effect on January 1, 2027.
2.  **Tripling of Addressable Market:** This CPT code expansion is expected to broaden reimbursement eligibility to cover multiple inflammatory and autoimmune skin conditions, which management anticipates will effectively triple the company’s addressable patient market to over 30 million.
3.  **Strategy for Higher Reimbursement Rates:** Management is actively pursuing a price increase submission with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the new expanded codes, with a goal of achieving higher reimbursement rates as early as 2026, ahead of the full CPT expansion.
4.  **Strengthening Portfolio and Pipeline:** The company continues to invest in its product portfolio, including its XTRAC, VTRAC, and TheraClear®X systems, and is pursuing clinical studies and publications to validate their use for new indications and combination therapies, further supporting market growth.

### **Current Management and Background (Dolev Rafaeli)**

1.  **Current Leadership:** The current President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice-Chairman of the Board is Dr. Dolev Rafaeli, who was appointed to this role on October 30, 2023.
2.  **Executive Tenure and Compensation:** Dr. Rafaeli has over 30 years of experience in the healthcare and medical device fields and has a direct ownership stake of approximately 2.5% of the company's shares. His 2024 compensation was heavily weighted toward fixed pay, with zero new long-term equity grants, a structure which some analysts view as prioritizing immediate retention over long-term, equity-based shareholder value creation.
3.  **Historical Track Record (External):** Dr. Rafaeli has a proven track record outside of his recent SSKN tenures, including overseeing sales growth from $19 million to over $300 million and significantly expanding the XTRAC device's global install base while at PhotoMedex.

### **Management History and Transitions**

4.  **First CEO Tenure and Succession:** Dr. Rafaeli previously served as STRATA's President and CEO from 2018 to 2021 before stepping down on February 28, 2021. Robert (Bob) Moccia was appointed CEO immediately after, bringing extensive experience in the dermatology sector, including leading companies to successful exit transactions totaling over $1.2 billion.
5.  **Second CEO Transition:** Mr. Moccia stepped down on October 30, 2023, and the termination was mutually agreed upon with the Board, classified as a "termination without cause" in the separation agreement. Dr. Rafaeli's return was welcomed by the Board, and he expressed a commitment to the company as a "long and significant shareholder."

### **Strategy, Key Decisions, and Performance**

6.  **Core Business Strategy:** The company's primary business model is the "Partnership Program," a recurring revenue structure based on a fee per treatment, which is a key driver for its dermatology segment. The company is focused on the XTRAC excimer laser technology for treating autoimmune skin conditions like psoriasis and vitiligo.
7.  **Future Vision and Growth Catalyst:** A major future growth catalyst is the expected expansion of CPT codes in early 2027, which is anticipated to broaden reimbursement eligibility to include up to 30 new skin conditions, potentially tripling the addressable patient population.
8.  **Operational Initiatives:** Management is focused on enhancing profitability through the "Elevate 360" platform, which aims to optimize partner clinic operations, increase average gross billings per device, and strategically remove underperforming units.
9.  **Legal and Competitive Decisions:** A key management decision has been the aggressive pursuit of a lawsuit against a competitor, LaserOptek, to protect the integrity of its intellectual property and prevent misrepresentation of its product's reimbursement eligibility.
10. **Financial Performance (Mixed Results):** Recent financial results (Q3 2025) showed a significant total revenue decline (down 20% year-over-year) and a net loss, but management successfully reduced operating expenses and reported a slightly positive adjusted EBITDA. Global recurring revenue, which is central to the strategy, has shown signs of growth, increasing 3% year-over-year.
11. **Shareholder Value Track Record:** The long-term stock performance has been poor, with a 10-year return of approximately -97.65% (as of late 2025), and a significant misalignment was observed in 2023 between high executive compensation and a sharply falling Total Shareholder Return. The company does not currently pay a dividend.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc.'s (SSKN) disclosures, including recent SEC filings and market data, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure:

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** Managers and directors hold a significantly high percentage of the company's stock, reported between approximately 40.92% and 57.6%. A higher percentage of insider ownership generally suggests a strong alignment between the interests of the management and long-term shareholders, as the executives' personal wealth is directly tied to the company's stock performance.
2.  **Recent Insider Buying:** Key insiders, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and a Director, have recently been net buyers of the company's stock. Insiders purchased over $790,000 worth of shares in the last 24 months with minimal selling, which indicates confidence in the company's future prospects.
3.  **Concentrated Ownership:** The overall beneficial ownership is concentrated, with major holders like Accelmed Partners LP owning 34.55%. While not all are managers, a major shareholder with board representation (Accelmed's Director, Uri Geiger, made a large buy) can also exert pressure for shareholder-friendly actions.

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

4.  **Emphasis on Equity Incentive Plans:** The company is expanding its equity incentive plan, which is often used to conserve cash and to tie management compensation directly to stock price performance and long-term value creation. The amendment seeks to add 520,000 shares to the plan, bringing the total reserved shares to approximately 26.1% of outstanding shares.
5.  **Stock Option Awards:** Recent compensation includes significant stock option awards for the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), suggesting a compensation philosophy that is heavily weighted towards future equity-based performance.
6.  **Cash Compensation:** The key executives receive a base level of cash compensation (CEO at approximately $408.71k, CFO at $493.19k, and COO at $490.44k). While the exact mix of salary and annual cash bonus is not fully detailed, the emphasis on equity and the relatively modest base salaries for a public company of its size suggest a structure aiming for performance-based rewards.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

7.  **Incentive Alignment is High:** The management and directors appear to have **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders** due to the very high percentage of insider ownership and the recent and substantial insider buying activity.
8.  **Performance Link:** The significant reliance on an omnibus incentive plan and stock option awards directly links a large portion of the executives' potential wealth to the long-term appreciation of the company's stock price. If the stock price rises, both managers and shareholders benefit.
9.  **Caveat on Performance:** The company's pay-versus-performance disclosure has shown a net loss in 2024 and a poor Total Shareholder Return (TSR) on a multi-year basis. This suggests that while the incentives *exist* to act in shareholder interest (i.e., through equity), the company has not yet successfully executed on the strategy needed to deliver positive returns for shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a technical and fundamental review of STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. (SSKN) stock price history as of late November 2025, here is an analysis:

1.  **Current Price Relative to 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading very close to its yearly low. Using a recent closing price of approximately \$1.35 and the 52-week low of \$1.33, the stock is currently **1.50%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis: Is it Trading Low?** The stock is definitely trading low based on technical indicators and price history. It is within a multi-month falling trend and is considered **oversold** on a key technical indicator (RSI14 is at 22, where a reading below 30 is typically considered oversold).

3.  **Long-Term Price Trend:** Over the last 12 months, the stock has experienced a significant decline, with a drop of approximately **44%**.

4.  **Big Drops Explained (Last Few Months):** The stock saw a sharp recent drop following its **Q3 2025 earnings report** released on November 13, 2025. The company reported a **20% year-over-year decline in total revenue** and missed analyst consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings per share.

5.  **Reason for Revenue Decline:** The primary driver for the revenue decline was a **60% decrease in equipment sales** and softness due to international market instability.

6.  **Positive Developments/Potential Gains:** Despite the short-term negative reaction, the company highlighted a major long-term catalyst: **CMS recognition of expanded CPT codes** for its XTRAC excimer laser, which is anticipated to **triple the covered patient population** in the U.S. This change is expected to take effect in January 2027.

7.  **Analyst Outlook:** The stock holds a general "Hold" consensus rating, but with an average 12-month price target that suggests a potential upside of over 370% from the current low price.

## Long Thesis

STRATA has a unique and highly stable business model: it provides specialized light therapy lasers (XTRAC) to dermatology clinics and earns predictable, recurring revenue every time a doctor uses the machine for treatment. The current low stock price is a temporary reaction to recent slow equipment sales and does not account for the company's major upcoming advantage. The key driver for future growth is a historical change in insurance rules (CPT codes) coming in 2027, which is expected to allow the XTRAC laser to treat up to 30 new skin conditions, potentially tripling the size of STRATA’s addressable patient market. If the company successfully scales its recurring revenue base to meet this massive new demand, its stable, high-margin revenue stream will surge, leading to significant stock appreciation. Management's high ownership stake and recent buying activity reinforce confidence in this future vision.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. The planned, historic expansion of insurance reimbursement codes (CPT codes) for the XTRAC laser must take effect as anticipated in early 2027.
2. Doctors must successfully adopt the XTRAC laser to treat the newly covered skin conditions, significantly increasing the utilization rate of STRATA’s installed devices.
3. The company must successfully manage its ongoing financial headwinds (like net losses and low equipment sales) until the massive recurring revenue growth arrives post-2027.
4. Competitors cannot introduce new, breakthrough drug treatments or alternative light therapies that are significantly cheaper or more effective than the XTRAC laser system before STRATA capitalizes on the market expansion.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for STRATA Skin Sciences (SSKN) hinges on a single, distant catalyst (CPT codes in 2027) while underestimating the immediate financial risks and the evolving competitive landscape.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **High Risk of Financial Failure Before the Catalyst:** The long thesis assumes the company can successfully manage its financial headwinds until 2027. However, STRATA reported a Q3 2025 net loss of \$1.6 million and a Q2 2025 net loss of \$2.5 million, with a cash balance of approximately \$6.0 million to \$7.1 million. This high cash burn relative to the cash reserves suggests a very short financial runway (likely less than one year) that requires immediate, significant cost-cutting or, more likely, a large and highly dilutive capital raise to survive until the revenue surge arrives in 2027.

2.  **Overestimation of the 2027 Revenue Surge (Competition from New Drugs):** The core assumption is that the expanded CPT codes will "potentially **tripl[e]** the size" of the addressable market and lead to a surge in XTRAC utilization. This ignores the rapid advancement in systemic and topical drug treatments for the new indications.
    *   **JAK Inhibitor Threat:** For key new conditions like vitiligo, new topical (e.g., ruxolitinib cream) and oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are either FDA-approved or in late-stage trials, and are quickly becoming a *first-line* standard of care for mild-to-moderate disease.
    *   **Standard of Care Relegation:** The XTRAC laser (a targeted phototherapy) is often considered a *second* or *third-line* option, or an adjunctive therapy, especially if patients prefer a topical cream or systemic pill over weekly in-office light treatments. This shift may cap the actual increase in XTRAC device utilization, diminishing the projected "tripling" of recurring revenue.

3.  **Risk from Slowed Equipment Sales:** The recurring revenue model depends on a growing installed base of XTRAC devices. The 60% year-over-year drop in equipment sales for Q3 2025 indicates that the "highly stable business model" is already under stress. Fewer new device placements between now and 2027 means a smaller installed base to capitalize on the CPT code expansion, severely limiting the post-2027 revenue surge.

4.  **Integration of Management Ownership:** High management ownership is presented as a sign of confidence, but for a micro-cap company with a short cash runway, this stake may motivate management to avoid a necessary, large capital raise (to protect their percentage ownership) even if it increases the risk of the company's long-term insolvency.

### **Bear Case Thesis for STRATA Skin Sciences (SSKN)**

STRATA Skin Sciences is a speculative, high-risk micro-cap company with a critical financial runway problem that severely discounts its primary growth catalyst. The stock faces a high probability of **significant dilution or insolvency** long before its 2027 CPT code expansion catalyst can materialize. Even if the company survives, the projected tripling of its addressable market is unlikely to translate into a proportional surge in recurring revenue because the **standard of care for new indications is rapidly shifting toward new, non-laser drug therapies**, primarily topical and systemic JAK inhibitors. This shift threatens to relegate the XTRAC laser to a less-frequent, second or third-line adjunctive treatment, fundamentally limiting the value of the 2027 reimbursement change and making the stock a low-probability bet on a highly distant, potentially diminished payoff.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the critical tension between the high financial risk (Bear Case) and the massive long-term potential (Long Thesis), your next steps should be hyper-focused on quantifying the financial runway and stress-testing the key long-term catalyst.

The search results already provided a good start:
*   **Financials:** Cash at \$7.1 million, Q3 2025 net loss of \$1.6 million, and a 9-month operating cash burn of \$(2.6) million, confirming the near-term risk. They also raised \$2.2 million recently.
*   **Installed Base:** The U.S. XTRAC installed base *slipped* by six units to 838. Management anticipates the installed base will start increasing again toward the end of 2025.
*   **JAK Inhibitors:** Management acknowledges JAK inhibitors but claims XTRAC is safe, non-drug, and studies confirm **combining** XTRAC with JAK inhibitors is safe and effective for vitiligo.

Here are the most important remaining questions to investigate:

1.  **Quantify the Financial Runway and Dilution Risk:**
    *   Using the reported **Q3 2025 cash balance (\$7.1M)** and the nine-month **operating cash burn (\$(2.6)M)**, precisely model the cash runway to determine the exact date STRATA will likely need a new capital raise. This is the single biggest near-term risk.
    *   *Question:* What is the average monthly or quarterly **free cash flow (or net cash used in operating activities)** and what are the specific covenants or minimum cash balance requirements set by any existing credit facilities?

2.  **Evaluate the Competitive Positioning of Combination Therapy:**
    *   STRATA highlights *combination therapy* with JAK inhibitors as an advantage. Investigate the current clinical trial landscape or real-world data to see if the combination of XTRAC + JAK inhibitors provides a **significantly better** outcome than JAK inhibitors alone for conditions like vitiligo.
    *   *Question:* Is the use of XTRAC an *add-on* service (implying lower treatment volume) or is it clinically necessary for the best outcome for the newly covered conditions?

3.  **Stress-Test the Multi-Year Growth Strategy (Installed Base):**
    *   The long-term value hinges on the installed base being high when the 2027 CPT codes hit. Investigate the specific sales pipeline, sales force size, and capital deployment strategy for **XTRAC placements** in 2026 to ensure the installed base grows meaningfully despite the 60% equipment revenue drop in Q3 2025.
    *   *Question:* What is the target number of net new XTRAC placements for fiscal year 2026? What is the current replacement cycle/cost for existing XTRAC devices?

4.  **Validate the High Analyst Price Target:**
    *   The analyst target suggests a potential upside of over 370%. Find the published analyst report (or reports) to understand the **specific revenue multiple and 2027/2028 revenue projections** they are using to justify such a high target.
    *   *Question:* What is the underlying assumption for the **utilization rate (billings per device)** increase for all 838 XTRAC units once the CPT code expansion takes effect?

5.  **Seek Clarity on the 2026 CPT Code Advancement:**
    *   Management initially sought temporary codes for the 2026 cycle but later indicated CMS does not plan to create them. Confirm the final status of any efforts to accelerate the reimbursement for the newly covered indications before the January 1, 2027, date.
    *   *Question:* What is the latest update on the CMS **2026 Final Rule** regarding the review of STRATA's submitted economic data for a potential **increase in reimbursement rates** for the existing codes?
