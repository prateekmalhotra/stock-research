## Business Summary

Samsung C&T Corporation operates as a highly diversified global conglomerate with four main divisions. Its core business model is centered on large-scale, complex B2B (Business-to-Business) operations, primarily through its Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Trading & Investment divisions. The E&C segment generates significant revenue by building large infrastructure projects globally, such as power plants, major office towers, and complex industrial facilities (like semiconductor plants for other Samsung affiliates). Its primary customers are governments, energy corporations, and major industrial companies across South Korea, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The Trading division acts as a global middleman, facilitating the movement of industrial materials and natural resources (like chemicals, steel, and energy) between suppliers and manufacturers worldwide. A smaller portion of revenue is generated domestically in South Korea through its B2C (Business-to-Consumer) segments: Fashion (selling apparel brands) and Resort & Food Services (running the Everland theme park and catering services), targeting local consumers and businesses.

## Business Model Risk

The company faces immediate threats from the volatility inherent in its core businesses. For the E&C division, near-term risks include unexpected increases in inflation and interest rates, which directly raise the costs of labor and materials (such as steel), squeezing profit margins on long-term fixed-price contracts. Historically, cost overruns and project delays, particularly in complex global power and infrastructure projects, have been a recurring cause of earnings volatility. Long-term risks are centered on geopolitical instability and corporate governance. Since the E&C segment operates heavily in emerging markets and regions like the Middle East, political conflicts or economic crises can lead to project cancellations or the inability of clients (often government entities) to pay, threatening future earnings. Furthermore, as a crucial holding vehicle within the Samsung Group, the company is susceptible to regulatory risks associated with South Korean corporate governance rules concerning *chaebol* (large family-owned conglomerates). Legal and succession issues involving the founding family have caused significant concern and market turbulence in the past, and any regulatory scrutiny on intra-group transactions or ownership structure poses a continued structural risk to investor confidence and its market valuation.

## Company History

This is a detailed history lesson on **Samsung C&T Corporation (028260.KS)**, a global company that is much more than just a construction firm. It is often seen as the foundational company of the entire Samsung Group.

***

### The Foundation and Early Goals (1938 - 1970s)

1.  **Inception as the First Samsung Company:** Samsung C&T's history begins in 1938 when it was founded by Lee Byung-chul as **Samsung Sanghoe** (meaning 'Three Stars Trading Company'), making it the very first company of what would become the vast Samsung Group.
2.  **The Original Purpose:** The business was initially founded as a small trading company, focused on local and overseas trading operations, with the ambitious vision of becoming a leading company across a variety of crucial industries for the burgeoning Korean economy.
3.  **A Major Tailwnd: Government Support:** In 1975, the company received a huge boost when the Korean government officially designated it as the nation's **first general trading company**. This recognition was a significant 'tailwind,' positioning the company to spearhead South Korea's crucial national export drive and global expansion.

### Entering the Construction and Lifestyle Arena (1970s - 2000s)

4.  **Expansion into Construction and Leisure:** The company's interests grew to include construction, with the establishment of Samsung Construction (1977), and the development of resort and leisure businesses, such as opening Korea's first family theme park (Farm Land in 1976, which later became Everland).
5.  **The Critical Merger (1995):** A major structural change occurred in 1995 when the trading company merged with **Samsung Construction**. This consolidation created the foundation for the modern Samsung C&T, shifting its focus significantly towards large-scale, global engineering and construction projects.
6.  **Establishing a Global Reputation:** In the post-merger era, the company quickly became a powerhouse in civil engineering and building, taking on iconic global projects. This showcased their technical expertise and helped cement a reputation as a world-class construction firm.

### Overcoming Headwinds with Innovation (2000s - Present)

7.  **Iconic Construction Milestones:** A key innovative solution to secure its global standing was to successfully complete some of the world’s most challenging construction feats, which acted as a powerful display of capability. These included the Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, and the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.
8.  **The Headwind of Corporate Restructuring:** A significant challenge was the 2015 "reverse merger" with Cheil Industries, another Samsung affiliate that focused on fashion and resorts. While the merged entity kept the famous "Samsung C&T" name, the structure meant the old trading company was technically absorbed, causing some controversy and a decline in its stock price due to the merger ratio.
9.  **The Modern Corporate Goal:** Following the 2015 merger, the company set a new vision to be a **"Global Business Partner" and a "Lifestyle Innovator."** This goal clearly defines its diverse business portfolio today, which includes Engineering & Construction, Trading & Investment, Fashion, and Resort services.
10. **Tackling Global Business Complexity:** A recurring problem was managing massive, complex, and geographically dispersed projects with aging, domestically-focused computer systems. The innovative solution was a major digital transformation, upgrading their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to a modern global platform to standardize and streamline processes worldwide.
11. **Pioneering Digital Solutions:** Today, they continue to innovate with a focus on future technology. They use a dedicated Digital Innovation Group to develop advanced tools, such as in-house Generative AI and AI-powered solutions, to improve productivity and analyze global market trends more efficiently.
12. **The Current Structure and Future Focus:** Samsung C&T now operates with four main pillars and other subsidiaries, aiming for sustainable growth by adding new 'Growth Driver' businesses. This includes a focus on modern demands like **energy solutions** (e.g., power plants, LNG), **smart cities**, and environmentally conscious practices, such as a pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

## Moat Analysis

This analysis focuses on the economic moat of Samsung C&T Corporation (028260.KS), emphasizing the factors that allow it to maintain its competitive position and profitability.

The moat is primarily built upon its unique position as the de facto holding company of the Samsung Group and its specialized, high-tech expertise in its core business segments.

### I. The Core Moat: Intangible Assets and Structural Position

1.  **Implicit Backing of the Samsung Group (Intangible Asset/Brand):** Samsung C&T is often considered the *de facto* holding company of the Samsung *chaebol* (conglomerate) and holds significant stakes in key affiliates, including a substantial holding in **Samsung Electronics** and a majority stake in **Samsung Biologics**. This ownership structure provides a massive, stable source of dividend income, an unmatchable balance sheet strength, and the implicit financial security and global credibility of the entire Samsung brand.
2.  **Captive Client for Complex Projects (Switching Costs):** The Engineering & Construction (E&C) Group serves as the primary builder for some of the most advanced and complex facilities for the Samsung Group, such as high-tech semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) and biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. This creates a guaranteed stream of high-value, highly technical **recurring internal contracts** and gives C&T unique, world-class expertise that few external competitors can replicate.
3.  **Governance as the *Chaebol* Linchpin (Cost of Replication):** The company's 2015 merger was a crucial step in the generational transfer of leadership for the Samsung Group. Its role as the organizational center of the conglomerate is a structural advantage that cannot be acquired or easily displaced by outside capital, as it is tied to the internal ownership and power structure of one of the world's largest companies.

### II. Differentiation, Pricing Power, and Customer Stickiness

1.  **Specialized Technical Differentiation (E&C):** Samsung C&T has established a reputation for successfully completing the most difficult global construction projects, such as the Burj Khalifa, Petronas Towers, and Taipei 101. This track record proves an elite level of technical expertise in ultra-high-rise, complex civil, and advanced industrial (plant) construction, allowing them to compete for—and often win—premium, high-margin contracts worldwide.
2.  **High Switching Costs in Biomanufacturing (Network Effect/Stickiness):** The Bio segment, driven by the majority-owned **Samsung Biologics (CDMO)**, has a strong moat based on high switching costs. Once a pharmaceutical company's drug is approved by global regulators (like the FDA) to be produced at a specific facility, moving that production is extremely complex, expensive, and time-consuming. This regulatory barrier locks in customers with long-term, multi-year, multi-billion dollar contracts, generating **highly sticky and recurring revenue**.
3.  **Pricing Power from Speed and Reliability:** In the CDMO business, C&T’s ability to build large-scale, high-quality manufacturing plants faster and more reliably than competitors (leveraging its E&C expertise) grants it a form of **pricing power**. Clients are willing to pay a premium for the certainty of quality, compliance, and a shortened time-to-market.
4.  **Diversified Portfolio as a Risk Moat:** The company’s division into four core groups (E&C, Trading, Fashion, Resort/Bio) acts as a powerful risk hedge. Underperformance in a cyclical sector like construction can be offset by stable dividends from Samsung Electronics or high-growth from Biologics, creating an exceptionally stable business profile.

### III. Innovation, Displacement, and Growth

1.  **Innovation Focus:** The company must **constantly innovate**, but its R&D is focused on **process and operational efficiency**, rather than consumer product breakthroughs. Its E&C and Trading groups utilize a **Digital Innovation Group** to leverage technologies like generative AI for internal productivity, and the E&C group is focused on developing new construction methods for next-generation, eco-friendly energy facilities. This commitment to technological *application* maintains its competitive edge in efficiency.
2.  **Ease of Displacement:** It would be **extremely difficult** for someone with more capital alone to displace Samsung C&T, especially in its core moats.
    *   An attacker could build more facilities, but they cannot buy the **institutional knowledge and decades of experience** in constructing world-class mega-structures and hyper-complex industrial plants.
    *   Critically, no amount of outside capital can replicate its **strategic position** as the *de facto* holding company of the Samsung Group.
    *   Displacing the Biologics business would require not only immense capital but also years of successful regulatory inspections and established credibility to convince major global pharmaceutical companies to switch suppliers.

### Current Management Structure and Background

1.  **Multi-CEO Structure:** Samsung C&T operates with a multi-CEO system, with separate Presidents & CEOs heading the four main business groups: Engineering & Construction (E&C), Trading & Investment (T&I), Fashion, and Resort.
2.  **Key Executives:** Notable current executives include Byung Suk Chung (Chairman of the Board), Sechul Oh (President & CEO, E&C Group), Jae Eon Lee (President & CEO, T&I Group, appointed for 2024), and Hailin Jeong (President & CEO, Resort Group, appointed for 2023).
3.  **Background:** The key management personnel, such as Jae Eon Lee, have deep experience within the Samsung Group, holding various roles across different divisions, indicating a focus on internal expertise and a strong understanding of the conglomerate's operations.

### Historical Context and Key Decisions

4.  **2015 Merger (Cheil Industries):** The current entity is the result of a controversial 2015 merger between the former Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, a move critics, like activist fund Elliott, argued severely undervalued Samsung C&T and harmed minority shareholders.
5.  **Succession Focus:** The merger was widely viewed by prosecutors and some investors as a key strategic decision to consolidate Lee Jae-yong's (now Samsung Electronics Chairman) control over the Samsung Group, making the merged Samsung C&T the *de facto* holding company.
6.  **Legal Track Record:** A Seoul court has recently acquitted Lee Jae-yong and other executives of charges including stock manipulation and breach of trust related to the 2015 merger, with the court stating the merger ultimately benefited the company and its shareholders by stabilizing management.

### Performance and Delivery on Shareholder Value

7.  **Financial Stability and Growth:** Management has maintained a track record of solid performance, with FY 2023 operating profit increasing by 13.5% year-on-year and a continued upward trend in operating profit into 2024, despite a challenging global business environment.
8.  **Shareholder Return Policy (2023-2025):** The current management has a three-year shareholder return policy, which includes a commitment to distribute the highest possible dividend payout allowed under their policy (KRW 2,550 per common share for FY 2023).
9.  **Treasury Share Cancellation:** A major commitment to enhance shareholder value is the plan to cancel all retained treasury shares in three equal installments over the 2023–2025 policy period, with the first cancellation, valued at over KRW 1 trillion, announced in January 2024.
10. **Activist Engagement:** Management's proactive efforts to improve shareholder value, such as the treasury share cancellation, have followed proposals from activist investor groups aimed at narrowing the company's discount to Net Asset Value (NAV).

### Future Strategy and Vision

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Samsung C&T Corporation's (028260.KS) management incentive and compensation reveals a structure that, while lacking significant direct individual insider ownership, is heavily oriented toward performance metrics designed to align with shareholder value.

### **1. Insider Ownership (Low for Professional Management, High for Controlling Group)**

1.  **Low Direct Individual Ownership:** The Executive Directors and professional managers hold a very small, often negligible, percentage of the company's common stock in their personal capacity. This suggests that the day-to-day management's immediate personal wealth is not primarily dependent on a rising stock price through direct equity holdings.
2.  **High Controlling Shareholder Ownership:** The true "insider" incentive is rooted in the Samsung Group's structure. The largest single shareholder, Jae-yong Lee (Chairman Jay Y. Lee), along with other Lee family members and affiliated foundations, holds a controlling stake of approximately **36.0%** of total shares. This means the professional management is ultimately incentivized to act in the interests of this powerful, long-term controlling shareholder.
3.  **Conclusion on Ownership Incentive:** The individual incentive from personal ownership is low, but the corporate mandate from the controlling owner—who has a massive, multi-generational stake—is extremely high, which indirectly governs the professional management's actions.

### **2. Compensation Structure (Strong Performance Alignment)**

1.  **Compensation Components:** Director compensation is a combination of a fixed **Base Salary** and variable pay from **Target Incentives** and **Long-Term Incentives (LTI)**, emphasizing a pay-for-performance philosophy. Independent Directors are paid a base salary and expenses only.
2.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Alignment:** LTI is determined over a three-year performance period, with key metrics directly linked to shareholder value and capital efficiency. These metrics include **Return on Equity (ROE) relative to peers** and **stock performance**, which strongly incentivizes long-term value creation.
3.  **Short-Term Incentive Alignment:** Semi-annual and annual incentives are tied to operational and financial efficiency indicators, such as **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), Operating Profit Margin, Revenue Growth Rate, Free Cash Flow (FCF)**, and achieving a positive **Economic Value Added (EVA)**. The inclusion of ROIC and FCF incentivizes management to generate profit efficiently and manage capital expenditures effectively.
4.  **Governance Oversight:** The compensation for directors is determined by the **Compensation Committee**, which is often chaired by an Independent Director, suggesting a degree of independent oversight in setting pay.

### **3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment with Shareholders**

1.  **Incentives Align with Shareholder Value (Generally):** The compensation structure is rigorously designed using key shareholder-centric metrics like **ROE relative to peers**, **stock performance**, and **FCF**. This suggests the management team is primarily incentivized to drive operational and financial performance that will lead to sustainable shareholder value, rather than merely "lining their own pockets" with unearned, high fixed compensation.
2.  **Potential for Conflict (Minority vs. Controlling Shareholder):** A key area of potential divergence is between the interests of the controlling shareholder group and minority/activist shareholders. For instance, the company's Board-backed dividend plan was approved over a higher dividend proposal from activist funds, causing the stock to fall, which highlights that the controlling shareholder's long-term strategy (which may include a focus on internal investment or group stability) can sometimes override the immediate desire of minority shareholders for higher cash returns.
3.  **Overall Conclusion:** Samsung C&T's management has **enough incentive, specifically through its highly performance-based compensation plan and the mandate from the controlling shareholder**, to pursue strategies of operational efficiency and capital market performance that benefit **all shareholders**. However, the low personal stock ownership by professional managers and the existence of a dominant, controlling shareholder suggest that the ultimate decision-making priority lies with the long-term, group-wide interests of the Lee family, which may lead to conflicts regarding capital return policies.

## Price History

Based on the recent price history and technical analysis for Samsung C&T Corporation (028260.KS), here is an analysis of its stock performance.

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock's approximate price is **188,000 KRW** (as of September 2025), which is closer to its 52-week high of 203,500 KRW than its 52-week low of 108,100 KRW.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The current stock price of 188,000 KRW is approximately **73.91%** above its 52-week low of 108,100 KRW, indicating a strong run over the past year.

3.  **Technical Analysis Assessment:** Technical indicators generally suggest the stock is **not trading low**; it is trending high with a positive outlook. For example, the 200-day moving average suggests a "Buy" signal, and technical analyses provide a "Strong Buy" rating on a monthly view.

4.  **Overbought Conditions:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently been observed above 70 (e.g., 73.14), which typically suggests the stock has entered an **overbought territory** in the short-term, a potential signal for a price pullback.

5.  **Recent Large Gains (Up "Bigly"):** The stock has experienced significant appreciation, rising over **30%** in the past year and more than **50%** over the last six months. This upward momentum has been a response to the South Korean government's "Corporate Value-up Programme."

6.  **Gains Explained by Corporate Reform:** The government program aims to address the "Korea discount" by encouraging large conglomerates (like Samsung C&T, the de-facto holding company for Samsung Group) to improve governance and enhance **shareholder returns**. Investor optimism that Samsung C&T would participate through higher dividends and buybacks fueled the significant price rally.

7.  **Notable Drops Explained:** A notable daily drop of over **10%** occurred in March 2024 after shareholders voted against an activist fund's proposal for a much larger dividend increase and share buyback program. The outcome disappointed investors who were looking for a swift and aggressive implementation of shareholder-friendly policies under the new corporate reform push.

8.  **Impact of Legal Rulings:** Positive legal news, such as the South Korean Supreme Court clearing Samsung Chairman Jay Y. Lee in the 2015 merger fraud case, has also provided supportive sentiment for the stock.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Samsung C&T is based on unlocking the massive, hidden value of its assets. First, the company is essentially the central holding company for the entire Samsung empire, owning large, valuable stakes in highly successful companies like Samsung Electronics and Samsung Biologics. Historically, the market has not fully valued these holdings, creating a 'discount.' In the near term, the company is acting forcefully to fix this problem by canceling all its existing treasury shares and committing to higher cash payouts to shareholders. This corporate clean-up should significantly boost the stock price. Over the long term, the company benefits from its core divisions: its construction arm is guaranteed steady, highly technical work building new chip and biotech factories for its affiliates, and its trading arm is pivoting into future-focused areas like green hydrogen. These stable, specialized operations provide cash flow to fund new growth in the highly lucrative biotech manufacturing sector, ensuring sustainable, dual-track growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario relies on several factors: 1) Management must fully execute its plan to cancel treasury shares and increase dividends exactly as promised, successfully narrowing the current discount to its asset value. 2) The company’s major investments, particularly its critical stake in Samsung Biologics, must continue its high growth trajectory and remain a consistent source of increasing dividend income. 3) The global economy must remain stable enough for the Engineering & Construction division to successfully execute its complex, fixed-price, long-term global projects without significant cost overruns or political disruptions. 4) The Samsung Group itself must avoid new, damaging legal or governance issues that could create uncertainty for the controlling structure.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Samsung C&T Corporation is robust on its fundamental asset value but overlooks critical execution and structural risks. The primary flaw lies in assuming that management's actions will *sufficiently* close the Net Asset Value (NAV) discount and that the core construction business is *truly* immune to cyclicality and project risk.

Here is a critique of the long thesis, identifying the holes and flaws:

### Bear Case Thesis: The Discount Remains Locked by Governance and Operational Risks

The market discount will persist because the management's shareholder return policy is insufficient to satisfy investors, and the core operating businesses face cyclical and capital risks. Samsung C&T remains a holding company for the controlling family, prioritizing long-term group stability and capital-intensive new ventures over maximizing immediate shareholder value, thereby ensuring the continuation of the "Korea Discount."

---

### Critique and Identified Flaws in the Long Thesis

#### 1. Flaw in Execution of Treasury Share Cancellation (Critique of Assumption 1)
*   **Insufficient Action:** While the company committed to canceling all treasury shares by 2028 (or by 2026 via equal installments) and increasing dividends, the pace and magnitude of these returns were deemed too conservative by the market.
*   **Governance Roadblock:** The company successfully defeated activist funds in a March 2024 proxy battle who were demanding substantially higher dividends and a faster cancellation plan. This victory by management led to a sharp stock price decline (nearly 10%), signaling to the market that the controlling block is not prioritizing maximum shareholder return, which fundamentally perpetuates the "Korea Discount."

#### 2. Flaw in Assumption of Stable Cash Flow from Core Divisions (Critique of Assumption 3)
*   **Construction Cyclicality and Risk:** The assumption of "steady" work is flawed; the Engineering & Construction (E&C) division's revenue and operating profit have recently shown declines due to the **completion of high-tech and large-scale projects** for its affiliates. This shows the E&C earnings are highly cyclical and dependent on Samsung Group's major investment cycles.
*   **Cost Overrun Risk on Fixed-Price Contracts:** The E&C division's core work involves complex, long-term, fixed-price projects (like chip and biotech factories). Historically, the company has faced massive losses (e.g., a $700 million loss in 2016) on such projects, highlighting a significant and often hidden risk to the operating cash flow.

#### 3. Flaw in "Unlocking" Biologics Value (Critique of Assumption 2)
*   **High Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Drain:** Although Samsung Biologics is experiencing high growth and expanding its capacity (Plant 5, ADC facility), this rapid expansion is highly capital-intensive. The required multi-trillion won investment for new facilities and next-generation technologies (ADCs, CGTs) is likely to limit the cash available for dividend payouts to Samsung C&T in the short-to-medium term.
*   **Rising Competition in New Modalities:** The lucrative biotech manufacturing sector is becoming intensely competitive, with global rivals like Lonza and Wuxi Biologics also aggressively entering and expanding capacity for next-generation drugs (ADCs, CGTs), potentially pressuring Samsung Biologics' future margins and growth rate.

#### 4. Flaw in "Future-Focused" Trading Pivot as a Cash Cow
*   **New Ventures are Capital Drains:** The pivot into "future-focused areas like green hydrogen" is an early-stage investment, not a reliable cash cow. The Trading & Investment division's operating profit actually dropped by 17% in 2024. The new hydrogen and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) ventures are currently a use of capital (part of the company's planned 4 trillion KRW investment), meaning they will *drain* cash flow before becoming a sustainable source of profit.

#### 5. Structural Governance Flaw (Critique of Assumption 4)
*   **Inherent Holding Company Discount:** The company's primary function remains maintaining the Lee family's control over the entire Samsung Group. The defeat of the activist proposal, which was a test of the government's push to reduce the "Korea Discount," confirms that the controlling shareholders will continue to oppose any measure that significantly dilutes their power or forces a massive, immediate cash distribution that could compromise the company's massive investment plans.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the core conflict is between the massive inherent asset value (NAV) and the continued existence of the "Korea Discount" due to corporate governance and slow capital return.

The first search already yielded critical, quantifiable data to support the bear case, especially regarding Biologics dividends and E&C cyclicality.

Here are the most important remaining questions and next steps, focusing on quantifying the shareholder return execution and the materiality of the new growth engines.

### I. Quantify the Shareholder Value Execution (Governance Overhang)

1.  **Treasury Share Cancellation Status:**
    *   **Question:** What is the specific, confirmed schedule and percentage for the **remaining treasury share cancellation** under the current 2023-2025 policy?
    *   **Goal:** The current stock price rally is tied to the *Corporate Value-Up* catalyst. Investors need to confirm the pace of share reduction and ensure management is executing the plan exactly as promised to narrow the discount.

2.  **Affiliate Cash Flow/Biologics Dividend Plan:**
    *   **Question:** Does Samsung Biologics (43.1% owned by Samsung C&T) have a publicly announced dividend policy or a *stated timeline* for when they expect to start paying dividends?
    *   **Goal:** The Bear Case is strongly supported by financial forecasts showing a **0.0% dividend yield** from Biologics through 2027, despite its high growth and value. This contradicts the Long Thesis's assumption of "increasing dividend income" in the short term. The next step is to look for any management guidance on this CapEx-heavy subsidiary.

### II. Quantify the Operational Segments and Risks

3.  **E&C Captive Client Concentration:**
    *   **Question:** What is the percentage breakdown of the Engineering & Construction (E&C) division's **backlog and/or annual revenue** derived from internal Samsung Group affiliates (Samsung Electronics, Samsung Biologics, etc.) versus external clients?
    *   **Goal:** Quantify the "captive client" moat. This number is crucial for balancing the Bear Case risk of cyclicality (E&C revenue declined in Q2 2025) with the Long Case's guaranteed project pipeline (e.g., P4 plant project).

4.  **T&I's New Growth Engine Materiality:**
    *   **Question:** What is the **committed capital investment (KRW amount)** and the **projected revenue timeline** for the new growth ventures in the Trading & Investment (T&I) group, specifically Green Hydrogen and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)?
    *   **Goal:** Determine if these ventures are substantial future growth drivers (Long Thesis) or merely capital drains and PR for the next few years (Bear Case).

### III. Search Strategy for Next Step

Your next search should be highly focused on the governance and CapEx numbers:

*   **Search Query:** `Samsung C&T remaining treasury share cancellation timeline 2025`
*   **Search Query:** `Samsung Biologics dividend policy and forecast 2026-2028`
*   **Search Query:** `Samsung C&T E&C revenue breakdown by affiliate and external projects`
