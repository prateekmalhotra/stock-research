## Business Summary

The E.W. Scripps Company primarily operates local broadcast television stations across numerous markets in the United States, providing local news, weather, and popular entertainment. Their business model relies on two core revenue streams. First, they sell advertising time slots to national and local businesses seeking to reach the stations' viewing audience. Second, and increasingly crucial, they charge cable, satellite, and streaming providers a mandatory fee (known as retransmission consent fees) for the right to include Scripps’ channels in their subscription packages. Therefore, their paying customers are advertisers (businesses) and cable providers, while their product is delivered to the general viewing public across various U.S. geographic areas.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant immediate risk for the company is volatility in advertising spending, as revenue can quickly drop if the economy slows down and businesses reduce their marketing budgets. However, a more serious long-term threat is the accelerated trend of 'cord cutting,' where millions of consumers cancel their traditional cable or satellite subscriptions in favor of streaming services. This trend directly harms Scripps because a large percentage of its guaranteed income comes from the retransmission fees paid by these cable providers. As the pool of paying subscribers shrinks, this high-margin revenue source erodes. This structural threat has been occurring for over a decade, but its continued acceleration jeopardizes the stability of the company's key revenue pillar and forces them into highly contested competition with technology giants for digital advertising dollars.

## Company History

The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP) is one of America's oldest media organizations, whose history tracks the evolution of news from "penny papers" to national television networks.

### Inception and Core Mission (1878–Early 1900s)

1.  **Founding and Purpose:** The company was founded in 1878 by Edward Willis "E. W." Scripps and his sister, Ellen Browning Scripps, starting with the establishment of the *Cleveland Penny Press* newspaper.
2.  **Original Goal:** The founder’s mission was to provide honest, low-priced, and well-written news to the working class, a segment of society he felt was underserved by more expensive papers.
3.  **Core Philosophy:** This populist mission is embodied in the company's long-standing motto: "Give light and the people will find their own way."
4.  **Early Innovation (Headwind Response):** Facing the dominance of the powerful Associated Press wire service, E.W. Scripps created his own wire service, United Press (later United Press International or UPI), to supply news to smaller and more independent papers.

### Diversification and Major Tailwinds (Mid-20th Century)

5.  **Riding the Radio and TV Tailwinds:** Recognizing the rise of new technology, Scripps diversified from print into radio broadcasting in 1935 and then television in 1947, successfully jumping onto the major media tailwinds of the era.
6.  **A Lasting Legacy:** In 1940, the company took on the stewardship of the **Scripps National Spelling Bee**, an educational program that would become one of its most widely recognized and enduring public-service initiatives.
7.  **Cable Television Expansion:** In the 1990s, the company capitalized on the cable television boom by launching and acquiring lifestyle channels, which became a massive, lucrative tailwind.
8.  **Creating Household Names:** This new division launched the Home & Garden Television (HGTV) network in 1994, later acquiring a stake in the Food Network and launching the DIY Network.

### Strategic Transformations and Industry Headwinds (2008–2015)

9.  **Major Spin-Off (Problem/Solution):** By the mid-2000s, the profitable cable networks were financially supporting the company's legacy newspaper and broadcast businesses, a classic corporate conflict.
10. **The Split:** In 2008, Scripps made a landmark decision to split the company into two separate, publicly traded entities; the high-growth cable networks (HGTV, Food Network, etc.) became **Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI)**, and the traditional newspaper and television stations retained **The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP)** name.
11. **Exiting Print (Headwind Response):** Facing the continuous, major industry headwind of declining newspaper circulation and advertising revenue, the company fully exited the newspaper business in 2015 to focus exclusively on broadcast and national networks.

### The Company Today: Focused on Broadcasting (2015–Present)

12. **Current Goal:** Today, The E.W. Scripps Company is a pure-play broadcasting company, focused on maximizing the value of its two main business segments: Local Media and Scripps Networks.
13. **Local Media:** This segment includes a portfolio of more than 60 local television stations across the US that are affiliated with major networks like ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX.
14. **Scripps Networks:** This segment includes national, free-to-air broadcast networks, such as **Ion Television**, **Scripps News** (a 24/7 national news channel), and **Court TV**.
15. **New Headwinds:** The company continues to face a soft traditional television advertising market, especially in sectors like automotive, and financial pressure due to a lack of political ad revenue in non-election years.
16. **Innovative Solution: Sports:** To counteract these headwinds, a key innovative move was launching **Scripps Sports** to acquire premium live sports rights, such as WNBA and National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) games, to attract dedicated viewers and premium advertisers.
17. **Digital Solutions:** They are also seeing strong revenue growth in Connected TV (CTV) and streaming platforms, a modern-day tailwind that allows them to deliver their national network content to viewers who have dropped traditional cable service.
18. **Operational Efficiency:** The company is addressing internal challenges, such as integrating numerous old contracts from decades of acquisitions, by using modern centralized contract management technology and exploring the use of AI in local operations to save costs and streamline its processes.
19. **Financial Focus:** A major strategic focus has been tackling debt, with efforts to refinance and pay down obligations to strengthen the company’s financial stability amid an uncertain economic climate.

## Moat Analysis

The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP) operates with a moat that is characteristic of the traditional broadcast television industry, primarily built on a foundation of regulated scarcity, established local presence, and recurring distribution revenue.

### Moat Analysis and Differentiation

1.  **Regulated Scarcity and Local Market Monopoly (Barrier to Entry):** The most fundamental moat is based on **FCC broadcast licenses**, which are a finite and difficult-to-acquire asset. Since new competitors cannot simply launch an identical local broadcast TV station, this regulatory barrier makes the core business incredibly hard to displace.
2.  **Dual Revenue Stream with Contractual Stickiness:** Scripps generates revenue from two primary sources: advertising and **distribution revenues** (retransmission consent). The distribution fees paid by cable and satellite providers for the right to carry their local stations are governed by **multi-year contracts**, making a large portion of the revenue sticky and recurring.
3.  **Unique National and Local Portfolio:** A key differentiator is the blend of its **Local Media** (over 60 local TV stations) and its **Scripps Networks** (national networks like ION, Bounce, Court TV). This combination provides scale for national advertising and deep, local relevance in specific markets.
4.  **ION Network's Massive Reach:** The ION national television network is available in nearly **99% of U.S. television broadcast homes** through its owned and operated stations, which provides a powerful platform to deliver mass audiences to national advertisers.

### Pricing Power and Special Market Position

1.  **Retransmission Consent Leverage (Pricing Power):** The multi-year distribution agreements give Scripps significant leverage to negotiate increasing fees from cable and satellite companies, as the providers need the local stations to offer a complete channel lineup to their subscribers. This revenue stream provides a strong baseline and predictable growth, separate from the volatile advertising market.
2.  **Political Advertising Premium (Special Position):** As a local broadcast powerhouse, Scripps is a primary beneficiary of high-margin **political advertising** spending, especially in presidential and key Senate election years. Candidates rely on local TV's broad, non-skippable reach to connect with voters, giving the company pricing power during election cycles that other media companies may not share.
3.  **Live Sports as a Differentiator:** The company has been aggressively acquiring local and national rights for live sports, such as the WNBA, National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), and NHL teams, which attracts a dedicated audience and high-demand advertising dollars. Live content is one of the few things viewers consistently watch in real time, making it premium inventory that commands a price edge.

### Displacement, Growth, and Innovation

1.  **Historical Growth and Foundation:** Scripps' long history, dating back to 1878, involved pioneering the "Penny Press" newspaper model and strategically evolving through consolidation and diversification into broadcast, cable, and digital media, establishing a foundational brand trust and scale.
2.  **High Capital Barrier to Displacement:** While a competitor with more capital could attempt to acquire an existing station group, it is virtually impossible to build a new network of comparable size and local market penetration from scratch due to the **finite and protected nature of broadcast licenses** and the cost of replacing established infrastructure.
3.  **Strategic Innovation over Traditional R&D:** The company's focus is less on traditional research and development (R&D) and more on **strategic innovation** to adapt to shifting media consumption. This includes investing in its digital presence, expanding its Connected TV (CTV) advertising business, and securing exclusive live sports content to create new, high-demand inventory.
4.  **Network Effects in the Local Market:** The strong local market presence fosters a small-scale network effect where a larger, loyal local audience attracts more local and national advertisers, which in turn funds better local content (news, weather, and sports), further cementing audience loyalty.

## Catalyst Analysis

The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP) has several key catalysts that could drive its stock price in the near and long term, according to recent financial results and management's stated strategy.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (2025)**

1.  **Significant Political Advertising Revenue:**
    The company expects a substantial increase in political advertising towards the end of 2025 (Q4), which historically provides a major boost to the company's Local Media segment in election years.

2.  **Continued Growth in Connected TV (CTV) and Networks Profit:**
    The Scripps Networks division has shown strong performance, with Connected TV revenue increasing significantly in Q1 2025 (42% growth), and the division achieved its highest margins in over two years (32% in Q1 2025).

3.  **Sports Strategy Driving New Advertisers:**
    CEO Adam Symson has highlighted the company's sports strategy, including its agreements with the WNBA and NWSL, as a key differentiator that is bringing new advertisers to their platforms and is expected to drive division performance.

4.  **Successful Debt Refinancing and Expense Management:**
    The company successfully completed refinancing transactions to extend its debt maturity, which improves its financial structure and positions it better for the near term. Additionally, management continues to focus on tight expense controls and savings from restructuring efforts.

### **Long-Term Catalysts and Management Strategy**

1.  **Potential for Industry Consolidation and Scale:**
    Management has explicitly stated that Scripps is well-positioned to benefit from potential Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulatory changes that could allow for greater consolidation in the local broadcast industry, which would enhance the company's scale.

2.  **Strengthening Local Media Footprint:**
    Scripps is actively optimizing its portfolio, such as through recent station swaps, to strengthen its market presence and financial stability, affirming its confidence in the long-term value of its local media business.

3.  **Leveraging Technology for Operational Efficiency:**
    The company is focused on improving its local operations by using centralized production and exploring the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to control costs and support future growth.

4.  **Focus on De-leveraging:**
    A core component of the management's strategy is continuing to reduce its debt leverage ratio following the initial refinancing and using its strong cash flows from peak political years to improve the balance sheet.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of The E.W. Scripps Company's (SSP) management incentive and compensation is based on its recent DEF 14A proxy statement filings.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (SSP)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Voting Control**

1.  **Dual-Class Stock Structure:** The company operates with a dual-class stock structure, which creates a significant separation between economic ownership and voting power. Class A Common Shares have low voting rights, while Common Voting Shares, which elect the majority of the Board of Directors, hold concentrated voting power.
2.  **Founder Family Control:** Ultimate control of the company is heavily concentrated with descendants of the founder, Edward W. Scripps, and other affiliates, who hold the Common Voting Shares. This family ownership acts as a long-term "insider" interest with a vested, multi-generational interest in the company's long-term existence and legacy.
3.  **Executive Management Ownership:** The direct, individual ownership stake of Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is modest (e.g., the CEO directly owns approximately 0.77% of shares), which is not considered high by itself. The primary alignment comes through their significant equity compensation grants and stock ownership guidelines, rather than large initial personal stakes.

#### **2. Compensation Structure**

1.  **Emphasis on Performance-Based Pay:** The executive compensation philosophy is heavily weighted toward variable, performance-based pay to align management interests with shareholders. The CEO's total compensation, for instance, consists of approximately 29.9% base salary and **70.1% variable incentives** (bonuses, stock, and options).
2.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Alignment:** Long-Term Incentives are delivered through performance share awards, which only vest into stock if specified multi-year performance criteria are met, directly linking a majority of executive wealth to sustained company success.
3.  **Key Financial Performance Metrics:** Compensation is tied to financial metrics focused on operational performance and cash flow, such as **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)**. The use of UFCF is particularly relevant in a company with significant debt, as it incentivizes management to prioritize cash generation and debt reduction, which are critical shareholder value drivers.

#### **3. Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

1.  **Structural Alignment Exists:** The compensation structure, with over 70% of pay being variable and tied to multi-year stock vesting and cash-flow/EBITDA metrics, provides a strong structural incentive for the management team to improve the company’s operational and financial performance, thus acting in the interest of shareholders.
2.  **Incentive to Line Pockets (Mitigated):** The high percentage of compensation delivered as performance shares and options (as opposed to just base salary or time-vested restricted stock) reduces the incentive for management to solely "line their own pockets" with guaranteed income, as their wealth creation is largely dependent on the stock price and meeting challenging operational goals.
3.  **Dual-Control Context:** While the compensation structure aligns the **executive management** with shareholder value, the founder family's control via the high-vote stock ensures a fundamental, **long-term legacy perspective** dictates the overall strategic direction and Board composition, which can be viewed as both a stabilising force and a check on short-term-focused management incentives.

## Price History

The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP) has shown significant volatility in its price history, with mixed signals from recent technical analysis and clear catalysts for recent price movements.

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Based on a recent closing price of approximately \$2.81 and a 52-week low of \$1.36, The E.W. Scripps Company stock is currently trading approximately **106.6%** above its 52-week low.
2.  **Technical Analysis Assessment (Trading Low):** The stock's technical analysis from sources like TradingView provides mixed to bearish signals; while some indicators were recently neutral or suggested a buy signal (like an MACD Bullish Signal Cross on one date), the overall rating on a short and medium-term basis (1-month) has been a "sell" signal. Although it is over 100% up from its 52-week low, it is still trading well below its 52-week high of \$4.17, suggesting it is in the lower half of its 52-week range and is not considered "trading low" by all indicators, but has plenty of room to the upside if momentum returns.
3.  **Recent Big Drop Explained:** A notable drop, specifically a 4.2% fall on one occasion, occurred after the investment bank UBS downgraded the stock from 'Neutral' to 'Sell'. The downgrade cited concerns over "upcoming headwinds," including worries that the mid-term consensus was too optimistic given weak volumes and lower near-term capacity.
4.  **Recent Big Surge/Uptick Explained:** The stock experienced a jump after two significant announcements related to strategic efforts to adapt to the evolving media landscape and improve financial stability.
    *   The company saw a jump on the news of a deal to launch six of its national channels (including ION, Bounce, and Court TV) on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming platform, which helps expand its digital distribution amid the "cord-cutting" trend.
    *   Another positive move followed the announcement of an agreement to sell the WFTX television station for \$40 million, with the proceeds intended for debt reduction.
5.  **Longer-Term Price Action:** The stock has been highly volatile, posting a **42.63% gain** over the past year, but a **16.36% decline** over the last six months, highlighting a general downward trend in the more recent past.
6.  **Debt and Financial Outlook:** Despite efforts like the asset sale, the company's high leverage remains a concern for some analysts, with a reported net leverage ratio of 4.4x; however, the moves to sell non-core assets are seen by others as an attempt to enhance long-term financial stability.

---

## Long Thesis

The investment case for Scripps is built on capitalizing on its essential status in the local TV market while successfully adapting to the rise of streaming. In the near term, the company is poised for a massive, high-profit cash flow surge from the 2025 political advertising cycle, which provides a one-time opportunity to aggressively pay down its debt load. Long term, management is fighting the loss of cable subscribers by expanding distribution onto new platforms, such as streaming services (like Peacock), and focusing on high-demand, non-skippable content like live sports (WNBA, NWSL) to attract premium advertisers. By achieving financial stability through debt reduction and improving efficiency via new centralized technology, the company is transforming itself from a highly leveraged traditional broadcaster into a modern, financially robust local media leader.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario relies on several key conditions being met: 1) Political advertising revenue must materialize at record high levels as expected during the 2025 election cycle, which the company must prioritize for debt reduction. 2) The company must maintain its contractual pricing power, meaning cable providers continue paying increasing retransmission fees despite the ongoing trend of cord-cutting. 3) The strategic moves into live sports and high-growth digital advertising (Connected TV) must successfully replace the revenue lost from declining traditional cable customers. 4) Management’s aggressive cost-cutting measures and integration of new technologies (like AI) must result in lasting and substantial operational cost savings.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for The E.W. Scripps Company (SSP) relies heavily on a high-leverage business successfully using temporary, cyclical cash flow to offset accelerating secular decline. The core flaws lie in overstating the permanency of cyclical gains, underestimating the debt risk, and ignoring the rising costs and pricing pressure in the very digital businesses meant to replace the declining core.

### **Bear Case Thesis: Structural Decline and Cyclical Reliance**

The E.W. Scripps Company faces a classic "melting ice cube" dilemma, where the accelerating decline of its high-margin traditional pay-TV business will likely outpace the low-margin and increasingly costly growth of its new digital and sports ventures, leaving the company perpetually over-leveraged and vulnerable to cyclical downturns.

***

### **Critique of the Long Thesis and Identification of Flaws**

#### **1. Over-reliance on Cyclical Political Revenue for Debt Reduction (Assumption 1)**

*   **Flaw:** The thesis assumes the political advertising cash flow in the "2025 election cycle" will be a one-time opportunity for *aggressive* debt paydown, but 2025 is a non-presidential, off-cycle year that historically sees a severe revenue cliff.
*   **Evidence and Critique:** The company's political ad revenue demonstrated extreme cyclicality, with the Q2 2025 off-cycle revenue plunging significantly from the prior-year election-peak quarter. The cash surge from the 2024 election was largely needed to manage the existing, high debt load, which had a net leverage ratio of 4.4x as of Q2 2025 and a high debt-to-equity ratio of over 200%. The company has even deferred preferred stock dividends to conserve cash for debt repayment, indicating that financial stability, rather than aggressive debt reduction, remains a primary focus and a strain on available capital.

#### **2. Retransmission Revenue is Structurally Impaired by Cord-Cutting (Assumption 2)**

*   **Flaw:** The optimistic view that the company can "maintain its contractual pricing power" and increase retransmission fees despite the "ongoing trend of cord-cutting."
*   **Evidence and Critique:** The total subscriber base, which dictates the total value of retransmission fees, is actively shrinking, with the subscriber count declining by approximately 5% in 2024. While the company has successfully negotiated new carriage agreements and secured new distribution fees for sports content, the foundational revenue base is eroding. The absolute number of cable subscribers is falling, creating a structural headwind that will inevitably limit any future pricing power gains.

#### **3. New Revenue is High-Cost and Faces Commoditization Pressure (Assumption 3)**

*   **Flaw:** The expectation that "strategic moves into live sports and high-growth digital advertising (Connected TV) must successfully replace the revenue lost."
*   **Evidence and Critique (Sports):** The strategy of acquiring high-demand live sports rights (WNBA, NWSL) is a high-cost endeavor, as evidenced by a reported $39 million multi-year deal for the WNBA. While viewership is growing, the substantial increase in programming costs puts pressure on the net profitability of this new revenue stream, which is replacing the high-margin, predictable distribution revenue from traditional carriage deals.
*   **Evidence and Critique (Connected TV/Digital):** Growth in Connected TV (CTV) revenue is strong, but the overall market has seen an influx of inventory leading to **lower pricing** for Scripps's CTV assets. This pricing pressure suggests that the high-growth digital revenue may suffer from commoditization and may not provide the high margins necessary to fully offset losses from the traditional business.

#### **4. Operational Savings are Insufficient to Offset Structural Decline and Impairments (Assumption 4)**

*   **Flaw:** The claim that "aggressive cost-cutting measures and integration of new technologies... must result in lasting and substantial operational cost savings."
*   **Evidence and Critique:** Despite reporting margin improvements in the Networks division, the company previously recorded a massive non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the networks business, indicating a permanent decline in the perceived value of assets. This impairment charge and the continued net losses show that the reported cost savings and efficiency gains are either temporary, being reinvested in high-cost sports rights, or are insufficient to outpace the ongoing secular revenue decline and amortization of goodwill. The need to continually reduce expenses while simultaneously investing heavily in new content creates a fundamental conflict for sustainable profitability.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis you've completed, the next steps should focus on quantifying the core conflict—**debt servicing vs. cash flow generation**—and establishing a clearer picture of the value drivers that are replacing the declining legacy business.

Here are the most important questions and areas to investigate further:

### **1. Quantify Near-Term Debt and Financial Headwinds**

*   **Political Revenue vs. Off-Cycle Cliff:** Explicitly determine the company's full-year political advertising guidance for the current **2025 off-cycle year**, which is a crucial check on the bear case. The previous analysis mentions a \$343 million record in 2024, but 2025 is expected to see a significant drop, as Q2 2025 political ad revenue was only \$2.6 million.
*   **Debt Servicing Pressure:** Investigate the required cash interest payments and remaining debt maturity schedule for the next two to three years. The company's refinancing pushed maturities to 2028 and 2029, retired 2027 notes, and they expect to pay \$175 million to \$185 million in cash interest in 2025. This cash outflow needs to be directly compared to the company's projected free cash flow (FCF) in a non-political year.
*   **Preferred Stock Dividend Liability:** Find the current balance of the accumulated unpaid dividends on preferred stock (held by Berkshire Hathaway) to assess the total financial obligation and how management plans to pay this increasingly high-interest liability, which is being paid "in kind."

### **2. Model the 'Melting Ice Cube' (Retransmission Revenue)**

*   **Distribution Revenue Outlook:** Seek company guidance or analyst projections for total **distribution/retransmission revenue** growth or decline for 2025 and 2026. While the per-subscriber rate increases, the overall pay-TV subscriber base is shrinking, making the *total dollar amount* the most important number for modeling the core business's runway.
*   **Renewal Schedule and Risk:** Identify the key pay-TV provider contracts (MVPDs) that are up for renewal in 2026, as 75% of pay-TV households are up for renewal in that year, which will significantly impact the retransmission revenue forecast.

### **3. Validate the Long-Term Growth Pillars' Profitability**

*   **Scripps Networks Margin Sustainability:** Look for detailed margin guidance for the Scripps Networks division beyond the recent Q1 2025 margin of 32%, which was driven by significant expense reductions. The bear case argues the new revenue (Sports, CTV) is high-cost. The company is guiding for a meaningful 400 to 600 basis point margin improvement in this division for the full year 2025, which needs further validation.
*   **Sports Revenue Contribution:** Get a clearer breakdown of the expected revenue contribution from the new sports deals (WNBA, NWSL, NHL rights), as the current data only indicates that sports inventory is commanding advertising rates more than 2x its non-sports inventory. The profitability of these deals, net of high content costs, is a crucial missing piece.

### **4. Understand the ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) Opportunity**

*   **Timeline and Revenue Potential:** Deeply research the **EdgeBeam Wireless, LLC** joint venture (with Nexstar, Gray, and Sinclair) to determine the expected timeline for its commercial launch and when Scripps anticipates realizing *meaningful* revenue from ATSC 3.0 datacasting. The total addressable market for automotive connectivity and content delivery is estimated to be billions, but the actual revenue split and launch schedule for Scripps is key.

### **5. Conduct a Comparative Valuation Analysis**

*   **Peer Multiples:** Calculate or find the current **EV/EBITDA** and **P/E** multiples for SSP and its closest public peers (Nexstar Media Group, Gray Television, and Tegna, if available). This will help determine if the stock is truly "undervalued" based on current valuation metrics, as one source notes Nexstar trades at 7.1x EV/EBITDA compared to an industry median of 7.6x, and SSP has a better "Value Grade" but a higher P/B ratio.
