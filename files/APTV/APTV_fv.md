## 1. Initial Financial Data & Key Assumptions

### A. Balance Sheet Data (as of September 30, 2025)

| Metric | Value (USD Billions) | Source / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$1.60 | As of September 30, 2025. |
| **Total Debt** | \$7.85 | Long-term debt (\$7.613B as of Q3 2025) + conservative proxy for short-term debt (\$0.241B from Q1 2025). |
| **Net Debt (Debt - Cash)** | \$6.25 | \$7.85B - \$1.60B |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 217.73 Million | Most current figure. |
| **Current Stock Price** | \$85.94 | Opening price on October 31, 2025, for market comparison. |

### B. Business Engine & Modeling Assumptions

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 Revenue (Full Aptiv)** | \$20.35 Billion | Midpoint of the company's raised full-year 2025 guidance (\$20.2B - \$20.5B). |
| **EDS Spin-off Impact** | Effective from Jan 1, 2026 | The spin-off is expected by March 31, 2026. Assuming full impact from the start of the fiscal year is simpler and conservative for a DCF model. |
| **New Aptiv 2024 Revenue Base** | \$12.1 Billion | Pro-forma 2024 revenue for the continuing business (Advanced Safety & User Experience and the remaining Signal & Power Solutions). |
| **Revenue Growth Rate (2026-2030)** | **7.5%** | Management targets "mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth" for the new, technology-focused company. 7.5% is a conservative midpoint of "high single-digit" growth. |
| **Operating Margin (2026-2030)** | **12.5%** | Management targets "low-to-mid teens U.S. GAAP operating income margins" for the new entity. 12.5% is a conservative midpoint. |
| **Interest Expense** | \$0.365 Billion | Calculated based on Q3 2025 nine-month interest expense, held flat as a conservative measure. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | A long-term conservative normalized rate, considering APTV's global operations and Swiss tax domicile, despite recent volatility due to one-time charges. |
| **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)** | **8.0%** | Conservative assumption. Historical TTM ROIC is in the 7.5% to 9.7% range. An 8.0% return ensures growth in the model while remaining below the high end of historical performance. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.5%** | Conservative estimate for a cyclical auto-tech company with a high beta (1.51) and moderate debt load. This is slightly below the WACC of 9.82% calculated by one source, remaining conservative on the rate. |
| **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth)** | **3.0%** | A very conservative rate, slightly above the long-term historical inflation average, reflecting the cyclical nature of the industry and a long-term economic growth assumption. |

## 2. Revenue and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

The valuation focuses on **Net Income as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**, as Net Income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year, with an additional income component from ROIC on accumulated cash.

### A. Revenue Model

| Year | Revenue Calculation | Revenue (USD Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Full Aptiv) | Management Guidance Midpoint | **\$20.35** |
| **2026** (New Aptiv) | \$12.1B \* (1 + 7.5%) | **\$13.01** |
| **2027** | \$13.01B \* (1 + 7.5%) | **\$13.98** |
| **2028** | \$13.98B \* (1 + 7.5%) | **\$15.03** |
| **2029** | \$15.03B \* (1 + 7.5%) | **\$16.15** |
| **2030** | \$16.15B \* (1 + 7.5%) | **\$17.36** |

***Justification:*** The model applies the management-guided 7.5% growth rate from the 2024 pro-forma base revenue of \$12.1 billion. The drop from \$20.35B in 2025 to \$13.01B in 2026 is a necessary *de-facto* subtraction of the EDS business, ensuring the model reflects the higher growth rate of the continuing, de-risked auto-tech entity.

### B. Net Income Model (All figures in USD Millions)

The formula used for the projection is:
**Net Income(t) = (Revenue(t) \* Operating Margin) - Interest Expense(t) \* (1 - Tax Rate) + (Cash(t-1) \* ROIC)**

| Year | Revenue | Op. Margin | Op. Income | Interest Exp. | EBT | Tax (25.0%) | NI from Operations | NI from Cash (ROIC) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Cash to next year |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025*** | \$20,350 | 12.0%** | \$2,442 | \$365 | \$2,077 | \$519 | \$1,558 | N/A | **\$1,558** | \$3,158 |
| **2026** | \$13,011 | 12.5% | \$1,626 | \$365 | \$1,261 | \$315 | \$946 | \$125 | **\$1,071** | \$4,229 |
| **2027** | \$13,987 | 12.5% | \$1,748 | \$365 | \$1,383 | \$346 | \$1,037 | \$338 | **\$1,375** | \$5,604 |
| **2028** | \$15,036 | 12.5% | \$1,879 | \$365 | \$1,514 | \$378 | \$1,136 | \$448 | **\$1,584** | \$7,188 |
| **2029** | \$16,164 | 12.5% | \$2,020 | \$365 | \$1,655 | \$414 | \$1,241 | \$575 | **\$1,816** | \$9,004 |
| **2030** | \$17,376 | 12.5% | \$2,172 | \$365 | \$1,807 | \$452 | \$1,355 | \$720 | **\$2,075** | \$11,079 |

\* *2025 is calculated as a rough pro-forma to get an initial Net Income from operations using the lower 2024 full-year Adjusted Operating Margin of 12.0%, as the spin-off has not yet occurred. Initial Cash is the reported \$1.6B.
\*\* *Cash to next year = Cash(t) = Cash(t-1) + Total Net Income(t).*
\*\*\* *NI from Cash = Cash(t-1) \* ROIC of 8.0%.*

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Perpetual Growth Model (Gordon Growth Model):
*TV* = (Cash Flow in 2030 \* (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*TV* = (\$2,075M \* (1 + 3.0%)) / (9.5% - 3.0%)
*TV* = \$2,137.25M / 0.065
**Terminal Value = \$32,881 Million**

### B. Discounted Cash Flow Table

| Year | Cash Flow (NI) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (9.5%) | Present Value (PV) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$1,071 | 0.913 | \$977.01 |
| **2027** | \$1,375 | 0.834 | \$1,146.75 |
| **2028** | \$1,584 | 0.762 | \$1,206.89 |
| **2029** | \$1,816 | 0.696 | \$1,263.10 |
| **2030** (Annual CF) | \$2,075 | 0.636 | \$1,319.10 |
| **2030** (Terminal Value) | \$32,881 | 0.636 | \$20,929.89 |
| **Total Present Value (Enterprise Value)** | | | **\$26,842.74 Million** |

## 5. Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated Fair Value of **\$94.56** suggests that Aptiv PLC's stock is **undervalued** by approximately **10.03%** based on these conservative, long-term projections.

### Justification of Model Assumptions:

1.  **Revenue Engine and Spin-off:** The model's conservatism is rooted in the assumption of a full-year 2026 revenue base of only **\$13.01 billion** for the *New Aptiv*. The **7.5%** growth rate is a direct, conservative interpretation of management's "mid-to-high single-digit" target, which is built on the high-growth tailwinds of electrification, autonomous driving (ADAS), and software-defined vehicles—the core focus of the new company. The market's valuation implies a lower long-term growth rate or lower margins than management's guidance.

2.  **Margin Profile:** The use of a **12.5% Operating Margin** is conservative, as management's "mid-teens" target suggests a ceiling of 15% or higher. The market may be discounting this target due to industry cyclicality, execution risk on the spin-off, and ongoing inflationary/commodity pressures in the automotive supply chain. The higher projected margins of the new, more advanced "pure play" tech business are a key value driver in this DCF.

3.  **ROIC and ROIC Feedback Loop:** The **8.0% ROIC** used is a lower-end estimate of Aptiv's historical performance (TTM ROIC has been near 10%). This conservative figure appropriately models the return generated on retained net income (cash) and ensures that the cash flows are robust but not overly optimistic.

4.  **Discount Rate:** The **9.5% Discount Rate** is a conservative WACC for a high-beta company in a growth-oriented, yet volatile, sector.

### Market Implied Assumption:

The current market price of **\$85.94** implies a lower long-term outlook for the post-spin-off entity compared to the model's assumptions. Specifically, the market is likely factoring in one or more of the following:

*   **Execution Risk of the Spin-off:** The market may be applying a discount to the realization of value from the EDS separation, doubting the successful execution and the achievement of the higher-margin profile for the remaining company.
*   **Slower Automotive Production:** The market might be projecting a more pessimistic outlook for global vehicle production and the broader macroeconomic environment, which would negatively impact the 7.5% revenue growth assumption.
*   **Goodwill Impairment:** The recent non-cash goodwill impairment charge of \$648 million in Q3 2025 related to the Wind River acquisition suggests challenges in software-defined vehicle program growth, which the market may be permanently discounting into the future.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated fair value suggests that the market has not fully priced in the long-term, high-growth, high-margin potential of the **New Aptiv** entity post-spin-off, as guided by management. The model's assumptions are grounded in management's stated internal metrics, yet remain conservative (e.g., using the midpoint for growth/margin, and an 8.0% ROIC). The 10% undervaluation gap represents an opportunity based on a successful strategic transformation.
