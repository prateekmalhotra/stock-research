## II. The Business Engine: Revenue and Margin Forecast

Aptiv's business engine is driven by two segments: **Signal and Power Solutions (SPS)** and **Advanced Safety and User Experience (ASUX)**, with a key strategic shift being the planned spin-off of the **Electrical Distribution Systems (EDS)** business (part of SPS) by Q1 2026. The core growth is expected to come from the high-margin ASUX business (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems/ADAS, software, and connectivity) and the high-voltage solutions within SPS (electrification).

The core assumptions are:
1.  **Spin-off Impact:** The EDS spin-off by Q1 2026 will create a smaller, higher-growth, and higher-margin "Growth Aptiv" from 2026 onwards.
2.  **Revenue Growth:** The company targets a full-year business bookings target of \$35 billion for 2024, confirming sustained strong demand for its products (which supports future revenue). Management has guided for a **7% growth over market (GoM)** for the full year 2024, which is a key internal metric. We will assume a lower, more conservative GoM for the base business post-spin, which is expected to be focused on high-growth ADAS/EV platforms.
3.  **Margins:** Management guided for a run-rate operating margin of **12.5% in 2025**. The post-spin company, focused on ASUX and high-value SPS products, is expected to have structurally higher margins.

### A. Segment Analysis & Spin-off Assumption

The Q4 2023 transcript cited a full-year 2023 revenue of **over \$20 billion**.

*   **2024 Revenue Anchor (Midpoint):** \$19.75 billion (from \$19.6B to \$19.9B guidance in Q3 2024).
*   **EDS Segment Size (Conservative Estimate):** The EDS business, which is the wiring/electrical architecture, is a mature, high-volume, lower-margin segment. For this valuation, we will conservatively estimate the EDS segment as approximately **40% of the 2025 revenue** (similar to segment disclosure of competitors or historical Delphi Automotive PLC pre-split segmentation), which will be removed from the 2026 revenue base.

### B. Revenue Forecast (2025 - 2030)

| Year | Growth Rationale | Revenue (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (E)** | Midpoint of most recent guidance. | \$19,750 |
| **2025 (E)** | Base growth from current portfolio. *Conservative 5% growth* (lower than GoM to account for market volatility). | \$20,738 |
| **2026 (E)** | **Post-Spin-off Base:** (\$20,738 * 60%) = \$12,443. *Conservative 8% growth* on new base (reflecting a structurally higher-growth, more focused company). | \$13,438 |
| **2027 (E)** | *Conservative 9% growth* (reflecting the strength of the backlog and high-growth segments like ADAS/EV) | \$14,647 |
| **2028 (E)** | *Conservative 9% growth* | \$15,965 |
| **2029 (E)** | *Conservative 8% growth* (Slowing slightly as penetration grows) | \$17,242 |
| **2030 (E)** | *Conservative 7% growth* (Moving toward maturity) | \$18,459 |

### C. Net Income Margin Forecast (2025 - 2030)

Management guided for a **12.5% Operating Margin for 2025**. The Net Income Margin (NIM) is calculated from the Operating Margin less interest expense and tax.

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   **2025 NIM:** Based on 12.5% Operating Margin and a conservative Net Income Margin of **7.0%** for the full company (reflecting interest and tax).
    *   **Post-Spin NIM:** The higher-margin core business is expected to show significant margin expansion. We will conservatively project a gradual increase to an 11.0% Net Income Margin by 2030.

| Year | Revenue (M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income Before ROIC (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | \$20,738 | 7.0% | \$1,452 |
| **2026 (E)** | \$13,438 | 8.0% | \$1,075 |
| **2027 (E)** | \$14,647 | 9.0% | \$1,318 |
| **2028 (E)** | \$15,965 | 10.0% | \$1,597 |
| **2029 (E)** | \$17,242 | 10.5% | \$1,810 |
| **2030 (E)** | \$18,459 | 11.0% | \$2,030 |

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The core cash flow is assumed to be Net Income (as per instruction).

### A. ROIC and Incremental Income

*   **Net Income into Cash Assumption:** Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative positive ROIC of **7.0%** is used for additional income on retained earnings, which is slightly below the trailing 12-month ROIC of 7.53%.

$$
\text{Net Income}_n = (\text{Net Income Before ROIC}_n) + (\text{Net Income}_{n-1} \times \text{ROIC})
$$

| Year | Net Income Before ROIC (M) | ROIC Income (M) (7.0% of previous NI) | Final Projected Net Income (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | \$1,452 | \$0 (Base year) | **\$1,452** |
| **2026 (E)** | \$1,075 | \$1,452 * 0.070 = \$102 | **\$1,177** |
| **2027 (E)** | \$1,318 | \$1,177 * 0.070 = \$82 | **\$1,400** |
| **2028 (E)** | \$1,597 | \$1,400 * 0.070 = \$98 | **\$1,695** |
| **2029 (E)** | \$1,810 | \$1,695 * 0.070 = \$119 | **\$1,929** |
| **2030 (E)** | \$2,030 | \$1,929 * 0.070 = \$135 | **\$2,165** |

### B. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is a relatively high discount rate for an established industrial technology company, reflecting the automotive market's cyclical nature and the execution risk associated with the spin-off and transition to ADAS/EV focus.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting the company reaching maturity and growing slightly above inflation.

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$2,165 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$2,208 \text{M}}{0.07} \approx \$31,543 \text{ million}
$$

### C. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The discount factor for year $n$ is $\frac{1}{(1 + 0.09)^n}$.

| Year (n) | Projected Net Income (M) | Discount Factor | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (1) | \$1,452 | 0.917 | \$1,332 |
| **2026** (2) | \$1,177 | 0.842 | \$991 |
| **2027** (3) | \$1,400 | 0.772 | \$1,081 |
| **2028** (4) | \$1,695 | 0.708 | \$1,200 |
| **2029** (5) | \$1,929 | 0.650 | \$1,254 |
| **2030** (6) | \$2,165 | 0.596 | \$1,290 |
| **Terminal Value** (6) | \$31,543 | 0.596 | \$18,795 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$25,943 million** |

## IV. Fair Value of Stock and Justification

### A. Calculation of Fair Value per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value} = \frac{\text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value} = \frac{\$25,943 \text{M} + \$1,640 \text{M} - \$7,613 \text{M}}{216.08 \text{M}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value} = \frac{\$19,970 \text{M}}{216.08 \text{M}} \approx \$92.42
$$

### B. Final Results

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **\$92.42** |
| **Current Market Price per Share** | **\$82.70** |

The calculated Fair Value of **\$92.42** is approximately **11.75% higher** than the current market price of \$82.70.

### C. Justification and Market Assumptions

The valuation suggests Aptiv is currently **undervalued** by the market based on the conservative growth and margin assumptions post-spin-off.

**Why the Calculated Fair Value is Different from Market Value:**

1.  **Market Skepticism on the Spin-off Execution and Automotive Cycle:** The market is likely pricing in a higher degree of risk related to:
    *   **The EDS Spin-off:** The successful execution and value realization of the planned separation of the Electrical Distribution Systems business by Q1 2026. Spin-offs carry execution and overhead risk, and the market may be uncertain about the financial performance of the "Growth Aptiv" immediately post-separation.
    *   **Automotive Industry Headwinds:** Concerns about the cyclical nature of the automotive industry, slower-than-expected Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption rates in North America and Europe, and pressure on global vehicle production are likely depressing the current stock price.
    *   **Net Loss in Q3 2025:** The reported Q3 2025 net loss of \$355 million due to a \$648 million goodwill impairment charge may have scared off investors, despite the non-cash nature and reaffirmation of long-term strategy.

2.  **My Model's Assumption on Future Margins (The Post-Spin Opportunity):** My model is making a strong but justified assumption about the future profitability of the "Growth Aptiv."
    *   The model assumes the post-spin company, focused on the high-growth, high-value-add ASUX and high-voltage SPS segments, will achieve a Net Income Margin of **11.0% by 2030**. This margin expansion is based on management's commentary regarding margin improvement initiatives and the expectation of a structurally better portfolio post-EDS spin. The market may be discounting this long-term margin potential and operating on a lower near-term margin expectation.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value of **\$92.42** represents a price that fully incorporates the long-term benefits of the strategic pivot (EDS spin-off) and the fundamental growth drivers (ADAS and electrification). The difference between the calculated value and the market price suggests a reasonable margin of safety, as the market is overly focused on near-term cyclical pressures and the execution risk of the spin-off, while not fully valuing the high-margin, technology-focused entity that will remain.
