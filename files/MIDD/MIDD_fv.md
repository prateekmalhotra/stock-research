## Valuation of The Middleby Corporation (MIDD) Stock

This valuation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, incorporating financial data from SEC filings and future projections derived from management commentary in the latest earnings call transcripts. The unique aspect of this valuation is the planned spin-off of the Food Processing Group (FPG) by early 2026, which requires valuing the core "RemainCo" (Commercial Foodservice and Residential Kitchen) and adding the separate value of the "SpunCo" (FPG).

### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The valuation model is built on segment-level performance and incorporates the publicly announced spin-off of the Food Processing Group (FPG) expected by early 2026. The future cash flow is calculated for the *Total Company* (Commercial Foodservice, Food Processing, Residential Kitchen) through 2025, and then for the *RemainCo* (Commercial Foodservice, Residential Kitchen) from 2026 onwards.

#### A. 2024 Estimated Base Revenue and Segmentation

A proxy for the segment mix (62% CFS, 19% FPG, 19% RES) is applied to the 2024 estimated full-year revenue of $3.9 billion.

| Segment | 2024 Est. Revenue (Millions USD) | Est. % of Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Commercial Foodservice (CFS) | $2,418.0 | 62% |
| Food Processing (FPG) | $741.0 | 19% |
| Residential Kitchen (RES) | $741.0 | 19% |
| **Total 2024 Estimated Revenue** | **$3,900.0** | **100%** |

#### B. Segment-Specific Growth Assumptions (Conservative)

Management commentary suggests challenging macro-conditions improving in 2025 and leading to a multi-year recovery.

| Segment | 2025 Growth | 2026-2027 Growth | 2028-2030 Growth (Maturity) | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CFS (RemainCo Core)** | 3.0% | 3.0% | 2.0% | Conservative, multi-year recovery driven by pent-up demand, backlog, new store openings, and innovation/market share gains (e.g., in beverage/ice). |
| **FPG (SpunCo, until 2025)** | 1.0% | **0.0%** (Spun) | **0.0%** (Spun) | Cautious growth for 2025 due to "market uncertainty" impacting large project decision-making. Value is separated from 2026 onward. |
| **RES (RemainCo Recovery)** | 5.0% | 4.0% | 3.0% | Higher growth from a low point as housing/remodel markets recover, leading to "significant upside in volumes" from new products and strategic investments. |

#### C. Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

| Year | CFS Revenue | FPG Revenue | RES Revenue | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | $2,418.0 | $741.0 | $741.0 | **$3,900.0** |
| **2025** | $2,490.5 | $748.4 | $778.1 | **$4,017.0** |
| **2026** | $2,565.2 | N/A (Spun) | $809.2 | **$3,374.4** (RemainCo) |
| **2027** | $2,642.1 | N/A (Spun) | $841.6 | **$3,483.7** (RemainCo) |
| **2028** | $2,695.0 | N/A (Spun) | $866.8 | **$3,561.8** (RemainCo) |
| **2029** | $2,748.9 | N/A (Spun) | $892.8 | **$3,641.7** (RemainCo) |
| **2030** | $2,803.9 | N/A (Spun) | $919.6 | **$3,723.5** (RemainCo) |

### 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Calculation

#### A. Margin and Operating Income Assumptions

| Segment | Adj. EBITDA Margin (Conservative) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CFS** | 28.0% | Consistent with high-end historical performance of 26-29%. |
| **FPG (until 2025)** | 25.0% | In line with long-term target and recent performance. |
| **RES** | Ramps from 12.0% to 15.0% | Starts at Q3 2024 level (nearly 12%) and ramps as market volumes and efficiencies improve towards the "normalized period" management goal. |

| Metric | 2025 (Total Co) | 2026-2030 (RemainCo) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Adjusted EBITDA Margin** | $925.7 M (23.0%) | Ramps from $757.0 M (22.4%) to $930.9 M (25.0%) |
| **Net Income Margin** | 10.0% | 10.0% |

**Net Income (NI) Calculation Rationale:**
The 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin is 22.4%. To derive a conservative, long-term **Net Income Margin** for the DCF (which accounts for Depreciation/Amortization, Interest Expense, and Taxes), a margin of **10.0%** of total revenue is used. This is a conservative assumption given historical adjusted EBITDA margins (over 22%) and the strong cash generation (FCF conversion over 135%).

#### B. Projected Net Income with ROIC Rule

The user-defined rule is applied: $\text{NI}_{n} = \text{NI}_{\text{based}} + \text{NI}_{n-1} \times \text{ROIC}$.

**Conservative ROIC Assumption:** A conservative but reasonable ROIC of **10.0%** is used, reflecting the company's track record of profitable growth through acquisitions and strong operating cash flow generation (FCF conversion).

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Net Income (NI) Margin | Base NI (Millions USD) | NI from Prior Year Cash | **Total Net Income (Cash Flow)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Total Co) | $4,017.0 | 10.0% | $401.7 | $0.0 | **$401.7** |
| **2026** (RemainCo) | $3,374.4 | 10.0% | $337.4$ | $401.7 \times 10.0\% = $40.2 | **$377.6** |
| **2027** (RemainCo) | $3,483.7 | 10.0% | $348.4$ | $377.6 \times 10.0\% = $37.8 | **$386.2** |
| **2028** (RemainCo) | $3,561.8 | 10.0% | $356.2$ | $386.2 \times 10.0\% = $38.6 | **$394.8** |
| **2029** (RemainCo) | $3,641.7 | 10.0% | $364.2$ | $394.8 \times 10.0\% = $39.5 | **$403.7** |
| **2030** (RemainCo) | $3,723.5$ | 10.0% | $372.4$ | $403.7 \times 10.0\% = $40.4 | **$412.8** |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### A. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This reflects a moderate cost of equity for a mature industrial company with global operations, a healthy balance sheet (2.3x leverage), and a history of robust cash flow.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Perpetual Growth):** **2.5%**. This assumes a conservative long-term growth rate slightly above the expected long-term inflation rate (U.S. economy's long-term GDP growth).

#### B. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value is calculated using the 2030 RemainCo Net Income:
$\text{TV}_{\text{RemainCo}} = \text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times \frac{(1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$
$\text{TV}_{\text{RemainCo}} = \$412.8 \times \frac{(1 + 0.025)}{(0.090 - 0.025)} = \$412.8 \times \frac{1.025}{0.065} = \$6,499.0 \text{ million}$

#### C. Net Present Value (NPV) of Cash Flows

| Year (n) | Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1/1.09^n) | NPV (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $401.7$ | 0.9174 | $368.5$ |
| **2026** | $377.6$ | 0.8417 | $317.9$ |
| **2027** | $386.2$ | 0.7722 | $298.3$ |
| **2028** | $394.8$ | 0.7084 | $279.7$ |
| **2029** | $403.7$ | 0.6499 | $262.4$ |
| **2030 (Operating)** | $412.8$ | 0.5963 | $246.0$ |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | $6,499.0$ | 0.5963 | $3,873.3$ |
| **Total NPV of RemainCo (CFS+RES)** | | | **$5,646.1$ million** |

### 5. Valuation of Spun-off Food Processing Group (FPG)

Since the spin-off is expected in early 2026, the FPG is valued as a separate entity and added to the RemainCo NPV. The value is based on its last full year of operation (2025).

*   **FPG 2025 Net Income:** $401.7 M (\text{Total NI}) - $337.4 M (\text{RemainCo Base NI}) = \$64.3 \text{ million}$ (Approximation using 10% Margin on $748.4M revenue).
*   **Conservative FPG Multiple:** The FPG business has higher organic growth (11% in 2023) and higher margins (over 25% adjusted EBITDA). Given its "best-in-class" status, a conservative P/E multiple of **15x** is used.

$$\text{Value}_{\text{FPG}} = \text{FPG NI}_{2025} \times \text{P/E Multiple} = \$64.3 \text{ million} \times 15 = \$964.5 \text{ million}$$

*   **Present Value of FPG:** Discounted back to present (2025 is year 1):
    $$\text{PV}_{\text{FPG}} = \frac{\$964.5 \text{ million}}{1.09^1} = \$884.9 \text{ million}$$

| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $6,531.0$ |
| **Plus: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $606.0$ |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $2,405.3$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$4,731.7$** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $53.793$ (millions) |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$87.96** |

### 7. Justification and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $87.96**

**Note on Market Value:** As of the time of the last data search (Nov 2024), the current market value of MIDD stock is not provided, but based on the search snippets, it was trading around **$144.71** (August 2025 snippet) or near **$167.76** (February 2025 snippet).

**Justification for Disparity (Market Value vs. Fair Value):**

The calculated fair value of **$87.96** is significantly below a typical market price (historical and recent trading range suggests a higher value). This large disparity is due to the extremely conservative assumptions mandated by the valuation rules, particularly the use of **Net Income as the proxy for free cash flow** in the DCF, and the conservative P/E multiple for the FPG spin-off.

1.  **Net Income as Cash Flow Proxy:** Middleby is a high-quality cash-flow generator. Management has repeatedly highlighted record cash flows and a Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion rate around **135%**, with FCF expected to exceed $544M in 2024.
    *   *FCF is typically much higher than Net Income* for a company like Middleby due to large, non-cash amortization expenses from its acquisition-heavy strategy.
    *   **The market values the FCF, not the accounting Net Income.** Using Net Income as FCF significantly underestimates the company's true intrinsic value.

2.  **Conservative ROIC/Net Income Margin:** The **10.0%** Net Income margin assumption is conservative for a business with 22%+ adjusted EBITDA margins.

3.  **FPG Valuation:** The market is likely pricing the FPG spin-off (a high-margin, high-growth industrial equipment business) at a premium P/E multiple well over the conservative **15x** used in this model.

**Conclusion on Disparity:**

The market is making a critical assumption that:
1.  **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** is the appropriate metric for valuation, not Net Income. The market values Middleby on a superior FCF yield basis.
2.  The company will continue its successful **acquisition and integration strategy**, driving profitability and FCF higher than a simple 2.5% perpetual growth rate suggests.
3.  The Residential segment **margin will recover to pre-headwind levels**, and the spin-off will **unlock significant shareholder value** by separating a fast-growing, high-margin asset (FPG) from the main Commercial business (RemainCo).

The DCF, constrained to use the conservative Net Income rule and other highly conservative inputs, results in an artificially low fair value. **The model confirms that the market views Middleby as a superior Free Cash Flow compounding machine, a factor that the mandated Net Income DCF methodology fails to capture.**
