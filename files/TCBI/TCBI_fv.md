## II. Forward-Looking Projection: Business Engine and Assumptions

TCBI's business engine is defined by its multi-year transformation strategy, which focuses on revenue diversification, a better funding mix (deposits), and commercial loan growth, all of which support higher asset quality and improved profitability metrics.

### A. Revenue Projections (in millions USD)

The core business drivers are Net Interest Income (NII) and Non-Interest Income (Fee-based Revenue), driven by commercial loan growth and the Treasury Solutions platform.

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | YoY Growth % | Justification of Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | **$1,256** | - | **GAAP Revenue** for the full year 2025 [cite: 2 in step 3] |
| **2026 (Estimate)** | **$1,344** | **7.0%** | **Conservative Estimate:** Management guidance for 2026 revenue growth is a "mid to high single-digit range" [cite: 8 in step 2]. 7.0% is used as a conservative mid-point of this guidance. |
| **2027 (Estimate)** | **$1,438** | **7.0%** | **Continued Scaling:** Assumes sustained execution on the strategy (Commercial loan growth of 10% in 2025, Fee Income growth from strategic areas). Continued strong execution warrants a sustained 7.0% growth. [cite: 9 in step 2] |
| **2028 (Estimate)** | **$1,539** | **7.0%** | **Decelerating Growth:** The Texas economy remains robust, but conservatively assumes a flat, mid-single digit growth rate as the bank scales off of a larger base. |
| **2029 (Estimate)** | **$1,627** | **5.7%** | **Initial Deceleration:** Reducing the growth rate from 7.0% to a more sustainable 5.7% to reflect maturity in the economic cycle and increased competition. |
| **2030 (Estimate)** | **$1,692** | **4.0%** | **Pre-Terminal Growth:** A final reduction to a normalized, high-single-digit pre-terminal growth rate. |

### B. Margin and Net Income Projections (in millions USD)

The most conservative and manageable metric for future cash flow in a DCF is Net Income, adjusted for any required capital retention.

**Net Income Margin Assumption:**
*   **2025 GAAP Net Income Margin:** $313M / $1,256M = 24.92%
*   **Management Guidance:** The company achieved a Return on Average Assets (ROAA) of 1.04% in 2025 and surpassed their 1.1% target in the second half of 2025 (1.2% in Q4) [cite: 6 in step 4]. This suggests a successful and sustainable path to profitability.
*   **Net Income Margin Projection:** I will use a conservative Net Income Margin of **25.0%** for all projected years (2026-2030). This is slightly higher than 2025, reflecting efficiency gains (Non-interest expense is guided for mid-single digit growth, slower than revenue guidance) and management's success in hitting and surpassing its ROAA targets.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) / Return on Equity Assumption:**
The instruction requires modeling additional income from previous year's cash using ROIC. For a bank, the most appropriate proxy for the return on retained earnings is the **Return on Average Common Equity (ROACE)**.
*   **2025 ROACE (Adjusted):** **9.6%** [cite: 6 in step 4].
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** I will use a conservative **7.0%** ROIC for all projected years to account for business cyclicality and to remain below the achieved 2025 ROACE, ensuring the valuation is highly conservative.

#### Net Income Forecast Table (in millions USD)

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) = A * Margin | Prior Year Cash (C) | ROIC % | Additional Income (D) = C * ROIC | Total Net Income (E) = B + D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $1,256 | 24.92% | **$313** | - | - | - | $313 (Base) |
| **2026** | $1,344 | 25.00% | $336 | $313 | 7.0% | $22 | **$358** |
| **2027** | $1,438 | 25.00% | $360 | $358 | 7.0% | $25 | **$385** |
| **2028** | $1,539 | 25.00% | $385 | $385 | 7.0% | $27 | **$412** |
| **2029** | $1,627 | 25.00% | $407 | $412 | 7.0% | $29 | **$436** |
| **2030** | $1,692 | 25.00% | $423 | $436 | 7.0% | $31 | **$454** |

*Note: Net income from each year flows into "Prior Year Cash" for the next year's "Additional Income" calculation, as per the instruction.*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions

| Metric | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | **10.0%** | **Conservative (but Reasonable):** This rate is higher than the S&P 500's historical long-term average return, and is appropriate for a regional bank that has recently completed a turnaround and faces interest rate cyclicality. A higher discount rate penalizes future cash flows, making the valuation conservative. |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | **2.5%** | **Conservative:** This rate is slightly above the long-term expected US inflation and is significantly lower than the projected 2030 growth rate of 4.0%. It assumes the company matures and grows only slightly faster than the general economy. |

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The projected cash flow is the Total Net Income (E) for the year.

| Year | Total Net Income (USD Millions) (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^n) | NPV (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $358 | 0.909 | $325 |
| **2027** | $385 | 0.826 | $318 |
| **2028** | $412 | 0.751 | $309 |
| **2029** | $436 | 0.683 | $298 |
| **2030** | $454 | 0.621 | $282 |
| **Total NPV of Project Period (2026-2030)** | | | **$1,532** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value estimates the present value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030) and into perpetuity.

*   Terminal Cash Flow ($454M) is grown by the Terminal Growth Rate (2.5%).
*   Terminal Value (TV) = [Cash Flow (2030) * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV = [$454M * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.10 - 0.025)
*   TV = $465.35M / 0.075 = $6,204.67 million

*   NPV of Terminal Value (NPV TV) = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Last Projected Year)
*   NPV TV = $6,204.67M / (1.10)^5 = $6,204.67M * 0.621 = **$3,853 million**

### D. Total Equity Value and Fair Value Per Share

| Metric | Calculation / Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | NPV Project Period + NPV Terminal Value = $1,532 + $3,853 |
| **TEV** | **$5,385** |
| **Less: Total Debt (B)** | $951 |
| **Add: Total Liquid Assets (A)** | $6,051 |
| **Total Equity Value** | $5,385 - $951 + $6,051 = **$10,485** |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding (44,253,688) |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $10,485,000,000 / 44,253,688 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$236.93** |

## IV. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$236.93** |
| **Current Market Price (Approx.)** | **$105.00** |

### Justification for Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **$236.93** is significantly higher (more than double) the current market price of approximately **$105.00**. This implies a major difference in the underlying assumptions between the conservative DCF model and the market's current valuation.

**Why the Valuation is Higher (DCF Assumptions vs. Market Perceptions):**

1.  **Market Skepticism on Profitability Sustainability:** The DCF uses a conservative but steady Net Income Margin of 25.0%, justified by management's success in hitting and surpassing its ROAA targets for 2025. The market, however, is likely pricing in a significant future headwind:
    *   **Bank Sector Fear (Contagion Risk):** The market may be heavily discounting all regional banks due to industry-wide concerns about interest rate risk, commercial real estate (CRE) exposure, and funding costs, despite TCBI's stated strong capital ratios and liquidity.
    *   **"Turnaround Discount":** TCBI has only recently demonstrated strong profitability, with full-year 2024 GAAP Net Income to Common of only $60 million [cite: 19 in step 2] compared to $313 million in 2025. The market may demand several more years of sustained, high-level performance before giving it full credit for the turnaround. The market's implied assumption is that the 2025 earnings are an unsustainably high peak.

2.  **Conservative Debt/Liquidity Treatment:** The DCF model is extremely favorable in its treatment of a bank's balance sheet:
    *   It only considers explicit short-term and long-term debt (**$0.951 billion**), while adding back all liquid assets (**$6.051 billion**).
    *   The market views the bank's non-deposit liabilities (FHLB advances, brokered deposits, etc.) as part of its structural funding, and applying a conservative $0.951B debt figure is not how the market assesses a bank's capital structure, potentially leading to a much higher Equity Value than the market accepts.

3.  **Terminal Value Driver:** The vast majority of the DCF value comes from the Terminal Value ($3.853 billion). The market's valuation implies it is discounting the bank's long-term growth and return potential far more heavily than the 2.5% terminal growth rate and 7.0% ROIC used in this conservative model.

**Conclusion:**
The market is currently pricing TCBI as a regional bank whose recent profitability will either significantly regress to a lower historical average or will be offset by unforeseen credit losses or regulatory/macroeconomic pressures. The DCF suggests the long-term, normalized value of a stable, profitable regional bank in the growing Texas market, operating at the efficiency levels achieved in 2025, is substantially higher. The valuation disparity is primarily a **risk premium** the market is assigning to TCBI's earnings power and the regional banking sector as a whole.
