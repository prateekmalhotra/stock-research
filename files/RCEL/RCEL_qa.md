## Business Summary

AVITA Medical's core business revolves around developing and selling the RECELL System, a specialized medical device used primarily by surgeons in burn and trauma centers (B2B customers) to treat severe skin injuries. This system enables doctors to take a small patch of a patient's healthy skin, process it immediately, and spray the resulting cells onto the damaged area, facilitating natural skin regeneration with less need for large skin grafts. The company generates most of its revenue through the recurring sale of single-use disposable kits required for each procedure, relying on the "razor-and-blade" model once hospitals adopt the technology. While the company has international operations, the vast majority of its earnings are derived from the U.S. market, focusing on expanding the system's use among specialized physicians.

## Business Model Risk

AVITA Medical faces substantial near-term risk because its financial health is highly dependent on the commercial success and broad adoption of a single product, the RECELL System. If a competitor were to introduce a superior or significantly cheaper alternative, the company's market share and earnings could be immediately harmed. A major challenge in the near term is securing favorable reimbursement rates; if insurance companies and government payers do not adequately pay hospitals for using the system, doctors will be hesitant to adopt it widely, slowing sales growth. Historically, new medical technologies frequently experience delays and difficulty achieving broad reimbursement, which harms short-term earnings. A key long-term risk is the successful expansion of RECELL beyond its core burn indication. The company must invest heavily in lengthy and expensive clinical trials to prove the system works for new uses, such as chronic wounds. Failure in these trials or difficulty gaining regulatory approval would severely limit the company's total growth potential and market position. Furthermore, the regenerative medicine field is constantly evolving, posing a long-term threat that advanced new therapies could eventually supersede RECELL, leading to pricing pressure and market erosion.

## Company History

AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL) is a regenerative medicine company that developed a groundbreaking technology to help patients grow new skin from a tiny sample of their own.

### **History of AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL): Inception to Present**

#### **The Inception (The 'Spray-On Skin' Idea)**

1.  **Founding and Original Purpose (Early 1990s):** The company's roots began with pioneering research in Western Australia, driven by Dr. Fiona Wood and scientist Marie Stoner. The core innovation was a "spray-on skin" technology.
2.  **Formal Establishment (1993):** The efforts to commercialize this medical breakthrough led to the formal founding of a company named **Clinical Cell Culture (C3)**.
3.  **The Founding Goal:** The primary purpose of the business was to radically improve the treatment of severe burn wounds. Standard treatment requires taking large sheets of healthy skin from another part of the patient's body (a skin graft), which creates a new wound site and is painful. The goal was to use a very small sample of the patient’s skin to cover a much larger burned area.

#### **The Core Innovation and Early Steps**

4.  **The RECELL System:** The company's main product became the **RECELL System**, a single-use device that creates a cell suspension (often referred to as "Spray-On Skin™ Cells") from a small skin sample at the patient’s bedside in under 30 minutes.
5.  **How it Works (The Breakthrough):** This regenerative solution allows surgeons to treat a wound with a much smaller piece of donor skin compared to traditional methods. Clinical data showed it could reduce the amount of healthy donor skin needed by as much as 97.5% for certain types of burns.
6.  **Early Market Access (2005):** The technology received the CE Mark approval, allowing it to be sold and used in the European Union, which marked an important step toward global expansion.
7.  **Corporate Evolution (2008 & 2019):** Clinical Cell Culture (C3) was acquired and rebranded as **AVITA Medical**. Later, in 2019, the company redomiciled its corporate headquarters to the United States and began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol **RCEL**.

#### **Headwinds (Challenges) and Solutions for US Market Entry**

8.  **Major Headwind: The Long Regulatory Road:** Getting approval to sell a novel medical device, especially a high-risk one like RECELL (classified as a Class III device) in the United States, is extremely long, complex, and expensive.
9.  **Crucial Tailwind: Government Partnership:** AVITA Medical successfully secured funding and support from the U.S. government's **Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)**. This partnership provided significant non-dilutive capital to fund the rigorous US clinical trials required by the FDA.
10. **Regulatory Triumph (2018):** After years of trials, the company received the highly sought-after U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Premarket Approval (PMA) for the RECELL System to treat acute thermal (heat) burns in adults. This was the commercial starting gun for the lucrative US market.

#### **Expansion and Current Strategy (The Present)**

11. **Addressing Adoption Headwinds (RECELL GO):** Once approved, a new challenge was making the device simple enough for busy operating room staff to adopt easily. The solution was the innovative **RECELL GO System**, an automated, next-generation device that streamlines the preparation process, reducing the burden of training and improving consistency in treatment.
12. **Expanding the Market:** The company strategically invested in clinical data to expand RECELL's approved uses. The FDA subsequently approved its use for pediatric (child) burn patients, full-thickness skin defects (trauma and surgical wounds), and importantly, for the repigmentation of stable depigmented vitiligo lesions (a condition causing loss of skin color).
13. **Financial Headwind & Goal:** Despite strong revenue growth driven by US adoption, the company has historically dealt with operating losses and a need to raise capital (equity dilution). The current focus is on managing expenses and accelerating sales through expanded approvals and the launch of RECELL GO to achieve **positive free cash flow**, aiming for financial self-sufficiency in the near future.
14. **The Goal Today:** AVITA Medical's modern goal is to use its platform, led by the RECELL System, to become the new standard of care for a growing range of skin restoration and wound management applications, expanding from burn centers to trauma centers and dermatological clinics.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL) is built upon a strong foundation of regulatory barriers, proprietary technology, and significant economic value proposition for hospitals, making its core product, the RECELL System, highly differentiated and hard to displace.

Here is an analysis of its competitive advantages and business structure:

### 1. Product and Regulatory Barriers (The Primary Moat)

*   **Unique Technology and Differentiation:** AVITA Medical's core product, the RECELL System, provides a "spray-on skin" treatment by rapidly preparing a patient's own skin cells (*autologous* cells) at the point of care. This innovative approach is significantly different from traditional skin grafting, as it requires up to **97.5% less donor skin** for treatment, which minimizes pain, scarring, and healing time at the donor site.
*   **High Regulatory Barrier:** The RECELL System is classified as a Class III medical device, which requires the rigorous, costly, and time-consuming **Premarket Approval (PMA)** from the U.S. FDA. This PMA, along with its multiple expanded approvals (for pediatric burns, full-thickness skin defects, and vitiligo), creates a massive regulatory barrier to entry that competitors with large capital would have to overcome from scratch.
*   **Strong Intellectual Property:** The core technology is protected by a robust global portfolio of granted and pending patents covering the device, methods of use, and next-generation systems like RECELL GO, further blocking direct competition for years to come.

### 2. Special Pricing Power and Market Position

*   **Significant Economic Value:** The product offers clear, quantifiable cost savings for hospitals, which gives AVITA strong pricing power. Clinical data has shown that the use of RECELL reduces the average hospital length of stay (LOS) for burn patients by about 36% (or 5.6 days). This translates to an estimated **cost saving of over $42,000 per patient** for the hospital, outside of procedure costs, by improving bed turnover and resource utilization.
*   **High Gross Margins:** The company's ability to maintain high gross margins (in the range of 81.2% in a recent quarter) suggests that the extraordinary value provided to the healthcare system allows them to command a premium price for the product.
*   **Market Position/Standardization:** AVITA is becoming a leader in point-of-care regenerative solutions, specifically in burn and trauma centers. By generating a large body of real-world clinical and economic evidence from the U.S. national burn registry (over 8,500 RECELL patients), the system is actively working to establish itself as the new **standard of care**—a powerful moat in medicine.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk

*   **Recurring and Sticky Contracts:** The business model is based on selling a **single-use disposable device** (the RECELL System) for each procedure. This creates a highly attractive recurring revenue stream, not a one-time contract.
*   **High Switching Costs:** Hospital adoption is "sticky" because the product is specialized and requires:
    *   Approval by the hospital's Value Analysis Committee (VAC).
    *   **Extensive training and certification** for surgeons and supporting staff.
    *   Once a burn or trauma center has invested in the device, trained its staff, and integrated the RECELL procedure into its surgical protocols, the cost (time, money, risk) to switch to a competitor's system is very high.
*   **Displacement Risk:** Displacement by someone with more capital is difficult due to the combined strength of the PMA (regulatory barrier) and the patent portfolio. While a well-funded competitor could invest in R&D, they would still need to successfully navigate the multi-year, multi-million-dollar FDA PMA process and replicate the strong clinical evidence that AVITA has already accumulated from over 30,000 patients treated worldwide.

### 4. R&D and Innovation

*   **Constant Innovation is Key:** The company's growth and competitive edge rely on continuous innovation. They invest significantly in R&D (e.g., $14.2 million in 2023) to both improve the existing platform and expand its use.
*   **Platform Expansion:** Recent innovations, like the **RECELL GO** system, automate the preparation process to reduce human error and speed up treatment, making the device easier for surgical teams to use. The company is also expanding into new, large markets like treating stable vitiligo lesions and full-thickness skin defects, significantly increasing its total addressable market (TAM). This constant, platform-based innovation is necessary to stay ahead of the general trend of technological obsolescence in the medical device industry.

## Catalyst Analysis

AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL) is a regenerative medicine company focused on acute wound care, with its core product being the RECELL System. The catalysts for the stock price are centered on the expansion of this core product into new markets and indications, resolving temporary financial headwinds, and achieving profitability.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Resolution of Reimbursement Headwinds:** The primary challenge in mid-2025 was a delay in payment from Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) following the introduction of new Category I CPT codes for the RECELL System. Management stated that all seven regional MACs have now published or confirmed provider reimbursement rates, which should remove a major barrier and support a return to revenue growth in the near term.
2.  **Increased Revenue from New U.S. Indication:** The June 2023 expanded FDA approval for the RECELL System to treat full-thickness skin defects significantly increased the company's addressable market in the U.S. to over an estimated \$2.7 billion. Near-term stock momentum is expected as the expanded sales force capitalizes on this new opportunity, particularly in trauma centers.
3.  **Launch of RECELL GO in Europe:** The company received the CE Mark for its next-generation device, RECELL GO, which simplifies the application procedure. Management is leveraging this approval to commence launches in key European markets like Germany, Italy, and the U.K., offering an immediate new source of international commercial revenue.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)

1.  **Achieving Profitability Targets:** Management has set a clear long-term financial goal to achieve cash flow break-even in the second quarter of 2026 and reach GAAP profitability in the third quarter of 2026. Consistent progress toward these milestones, after previous delays, would be a major long-term positive for the stock.
2.  **Expansion into New Product Categories:** Long-term growth is supported by expanding the commercial footprint of new complementary products like PermeaDerm and Cohealyx, which are designed to be used alongside RECELL. This strategy diversifies revenue and strengthens the company’s position in the acute wound care market.
3.  **Continued Adoption as Standard of Care:** Real-world clinical data shows that using the RECELL System significantly improves patient outcomes, including a reported 36% reduction in hospital length-of-stay and substantial per-patient cost savings. Over time, continuous presentation of such data at medical conferences is expected to drive broader adoption and reinforce RECELL's status as a standard-of-care solution.
4.  **NTAP and Potential Commercial Reimbursement:** The CMS approval of a New Technology Add-On Payment (NTAP) for non-burn acute wounds enhances access to RECELL for a wider range of trauma patients. Successful penetration and utilization in this new reimbursement pathway will be a sustained long-term revenue driver.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings, including proxy statements, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation for AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership (Managers and Directors)**
    *   The percentage of stock owned by officers and directors (insiders) is relatively low, cited as approximately **2.80% to 3.35%**. For a small-cap company, this level is typically considered moderate to low, meaning the direct financial stake of management is not extremely high (the "higher the better" principle).
    *   However, recent insider activity shows that managers and directors have collectively **bought more shares than they have sold** in the past few months, which is a positive sign of confidence in the company's future prospects.

2.  **Compensation Structure**
    *   The total compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is heavily weighted toward **at-risk, long-term equity awards** (stock options and restricted stock/Performance Stock Units) over a fixed base salary.
    *   For example, the former CEO's 2024 total compensation was approximately $3.2 million, with a small portion (19%) as base salary and a large majority (81%) as "other" remuneration, mostly equity. This heavy reliance on stock means the majority of their potential wealth is directly tied to the stock price performance.

3.  **Incentive Alignment (Performance Metrics)**
    *   The company's Long-Term Incentive (LTI) program utilizes **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)** and **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**. For the 2024 grants, LTI was weighted 60% PSUs and 40% RSUs, making the majority performance-based.
    *   The vesting of PSUs is tied to pre-established, quantitative performance goals over a three-year period. The specific metrics for the 2024 PSUs are:
        *   **75%** based on **2024-2026 Cumulative Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS)**.
        *   **25%** based on **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** compared to the S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index.
    *   These metrics directly link executive payout to both financial profitability (Adjusted EPS) and stock market performance relative to peers (Relative TSR), which are strong indicators of shareholder value creation.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

4.  **Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest**
    *   **Yes, there is a strong structural incentive** for management to act in the shareholders' interest, primarily due to the compensation mix. A high proportion of compensation is equity-based, and a majority of that equity is performance-based (PSUs) tied to **financial results (Adjusted EPS)** and **relative stock price (Relative TSR)**.
    *   The structure minimizes incentive to "line their own pockets" purely through salary, as a substantial portion of their earnings is at-risk and contingent on achieving metrics that directly benefit all shareholders.
    *   While the outright insider ownership percentage is not exceptionally high, the significant proportion of compensation granted as performance-vesting equity awards is designed to effectively achieve long-term alignment with stockholder return.

## Price History

Based on the closing price of \$3.91 on November 26, 2025, and a 52-week low of \$3.35, here is an analysis of AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL).

1.  **52-Week Range & Low Proximity:** The stock is trading near its 52-week low of \$3.35, having fallen substantially from its 52-week high of \$14.16. The current price of \$3.91 is approximately **16.72%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis Outlook (Trading Low):** The overall technical analysis sentiment from various indicators is a "Sell" or "Strong Sell." This suggests the stock is currently trading low within a negative trend.

3.  **Technical Trend:** The stock is exhibiting weak development and is situated within a falling trend channel in the medium-to-long term, which signals increasing pessimism among investors and indicates a potential for further decline.

4.  **Significant Price Drop Explanation (Last Few Months):** The stock has experienced a sharp decline over the last six months (down 37.74%) and the last year (down 69.67%), largely due to disappointing financial results and guidance cuts.

5.  **Reason for Q2 Drop (August 2025):** A major drop of nearly 35% occurred after the Q2 2025 earnings report, as the company missed revenue forecasts and significantly lowered its full-year revenue guidance. Management attributed this to an industry-wide claims processing issue regarding a conversion to new Medicare CPT codes for their key product, RECELL, which impacted provider reimbursement and product demand.

6.  **Reason for Q3 Drop (November 2025):** The stock saw further decline after the Q3 2025 results, where both Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenue missed analyst estimates. This was accompanied by a further reduction in the full-year revenue outlook, which compounded investor concern over the company's ability to meet expectations.

## Long Thesis

AVITA Medical is set up for significant growth because its 'spray-on skin' technology (RECELL System) is a proven, unique solution that helps patients heal faster with less scarring and saves hospitals substantial money by reducing the patient's time in the hospital. The stock is currently undervalued because of recent, temporary payment processing delays with Medicare, which are now largely fixed. In the near term, sales growth will accelerate rapidly as hospitals receive consistent payment for procedures and the company rolls out its easier-to-use device (RECELL GO). The long-term bull case centers on expanding the product far beyond its original use in severe burns, successfully establishing RECELL as the new standard of care for massive markets like general trauma and surgical wounds, and specialized cosmetic conditions like vitiligo. If the company hits its target of becoming financially profitable by late 2026, it will transform from a high-risk growth stock into a durable, self-sustaining medical technology leader with a deep competitive advantage.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

For the bull case to succeed, several things must happen. First, the temporary payment issues that recently plagued sales must be completely resolved, allowing hospitals to use the RECELL system without fear of delayed or denied insurance claims. Second, the company must successfully transition its product into much larger markets like trauma care, meaning surgeons must widely adopt the technology for non-burn injuries. Third, and most critical for the stock price, the company must follow through on its promise to achieve financial break-even and GAAP profitability by late 2026. This financial stability is essential to remove the risk of needing to ask investors for more cash. Finally, the company must maintain its regulatory moat, ensuring no competitor is able to quickly bring a similar, cheaper 'spray-on skin' product to market.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL) is centered on a series of positive future events and the assumption that current issues are merely temporary. A deep dive into the available data reveals significant execution risk, financial fragility, and evidence that the headwinds are more material and prolonged than the thesis suggests.

## Critique of the Long Thesis (Identifying Flaws and Faults)

### I. Flaw in "Temporary Payment Processing Delays are Largely Fixed"

1.  **Reimbursement Issues are Prolonged and Material:** The "temporary" Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) payment issues led to a severe reduction in utilization and forced the company to significantly lower its full-year 2025 revenue guidance from an initial $100M-$106M to a revised range of **$70M-$74M** (as of Q3 2025). This massive cut demonstrates a major commercial setback that is far more than a "temporary" administrative delay.
2.  **Slower-Than-Anticipated Resolution:** As of the Q3 2025 update, management indicated that the normalization of reimbursement and return of demand was *slower than anticipated*, meaning the problem is still creating a significant headwind and revenue lag. The residual impact is now affecting future year's forecasts.
3.  **Profitability Target Delay:** The direct consequence of the sales dip is a six-to-nine-month delay in the critical financial goals. The target for cash flow break-even was pushed from late 2025 to **Q2 2026**, and GAAP profitability from Q4 2025 to **Q3 2026**. The bull case minimizes the impact of this delay on risk profile and valuation.

### II. Flaw in "Achieve Financial Profitability by Late 2026"

1.  **High Financial Fragility and Liquidity Risk:** The company's balance sheet showed a near **940% debt-to-equity ratio** and relatively low cash reserves ($15.7 million as of June 30, 2025). The need to amend credit agreements and issue common stock to its lender (OrbiMed) in lieu of a cash fee signals financial distress and increases the risk of a highly **dilutive equity raise** if the revised 2026 break-even targets are missed.
2.  **Aggressive Future Growth Requirement:** Hitting the delayed 2026 profitability target requires aggressive, sustained revenue acceleration and perfect execution in the new market segments to compensate for the current year's shortfall. Analysts had previously projected a required annual growth rate of over **60%** to hit the break-even date, a rate that is difficult to sustain.

### III. Flaw in "Long-Term Bull Case Centers on Expanding Product... to Massive Markets"

1.  **Adoption is a Process, Not a Guarantee:** While the expansion into non-burn full-thickness skin defects (trauma/surgical wounds) is a huge potential market ($3.5B TAM) and a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for Medicare helps, commercial adoption is not automatic. The new products are still in the early stages of navigating hospital bureaucracy, specifically the **Value Analysis Committees (VACs)**, which is a slow process that could delay the expected revenue acceleration.
2.  **RECELL GO is Not a Silver Bullet:** The simpler-to-use **RECELL GO** is a clear product improvement, but its successful launch does not guarantee a massive, immediate uptake. Its impact could be gradual as the company focuses on a limited number of high-volume trauma centers (200 accounts). The market is in "show-me-the-revenue mode" rather than pricing in this potential.

### IV. Flaw in "Maintain its Regulatory Moat"

1.  **Existence of Direct Technology Competitors:** The assumption of a deep regulatory moat is questionable. Historically, a direct technology competitor, **RenovaCare**, has been identified and has a similar "spray-on skin" device, demonstrating the technology is not unique to AVITA and that the company is vulnerable to future FDA approvals.
2.  **Functional Competition in Broader Markets:** In the larger, general wound care markets, competition from alternative regenerative medicine products, such as **Aroa Biosurgery's Endoform**, which uses a collagen scaffold for similar wound-healing functions, provides a substitute option for surgeons. A cheaper, non-device-based substitute could erode the high gross margins of the RECELL System.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL)

AVITA Medical is an extremely high-risk growth stock that is struggling with execution and faces a looming liquidity event. The bull case's core assumptions—that administrative problems are solved and revenue acceleration is imminent—are overly optimistic.

1.  **The Delayed Financial Timebomb:** The inability to hit initial profitability targets, forcing a delay to Q3 2026, exposes the company's financial fragility. With high debt and a low cash runway, failure to meet this *revised* target could force a significantly dilutive equity raise, severely punishing shareholders.
2.  **High-Friction Market Penetration:** The massive expansion into trauma and surgical wounds will be slower and more difficult than anticipated. Positive clinical data and government payment incentives (NTAP) do not automatically translate to rapid adoption, as the technology must still pass slowly moving hospital Value Analysis Committees (VACs) and overcome ingrained surgical practice preferences.
3.  **Vulnerable Moat and Margin Pressure:** The "regulatory moat" is not absolute, with direct technological competitors existing in the pipeline and functional alternatives competing in the broader wound care market. As AVITA diversifies its product mix (Cohealyx, PermeaDerm) with lower-margin profit-sharing arrangements, the overall gross margin will decline, increasing the burden on the high-margin RECELL system to drive profitability.
4.  **Sales Momentum Stalled:** The administrative reimbursement hiccup in 2025, which proved to be a material business headwind, has fundamentally broken the high-growth narrative. The company must now rebuild trust with hospitals and investors, making the promised "rapid acceleration" highly unlikely in the near term and casting doubt on its long-term viability as a durable leader.

## Next Steps

The initial investigation has provided significant, up-to-date financial and competitive information that helps sharpen the core conflict between the bull and bear cases.

Based on the full analysis, here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for investigation:

### **Next Steps and Unanswered Questions to Investigate**

#### **1. Competitive Landscape and Moat Durability**

*   **Determine the Current Threat of RenovaCare:** The search results for RenovaCare's "SkinGun" are from 2021 (IDE approval to *begin* a safety/feasibility trial). The critical question is the current status of that trial and their proximity to a full FDA Premarket Approval (PMA). The lack of recent news may suggest a stalled pipeline, but this needs confirmation.
    *   **Search Query:** `RenovaCare SkinGun clinical trial status 2026`

*   **Assess the Impact of Functional Competitors (e.g., Aroa Biosurgery):** The bear case mentions alternatives like Aroa Biosurgery's Endoform. Investigate the comparative clinical data (e.g., healing time, cost effectiveness) of these competing non-device products to see if they pose a material threat to RECELL's high gross margins.
    *   **Search Query:** `RECELL System vs Aroa Biosurgery Endoform cost effectiveness`

#### **2. Resolution of the Reimbursement Headwind**

*   **Confirm CPT Code Resolution and Demand Normalization:** The Q3 2025 report noted the reimbursement normalization was "slower than anticipated" and forced a second revenue guidance cut. The primary unknown is the *current* state of claims processing and procedure volume as of late 2025/early 2026. This is the single biggest factor in the near-term stock trajectory.
    *   **Search Query:** `AVITA Medical reimbursement status Q4 2025 / Q1 2026 update` (Seeking specific recent commentary beyond the Q3 2025 report.)

#### **3. Management and Execution Stability**

*   **Identify the Permanent CEO:** A major risk is the ongoing management transition. The analysis notes an *Interim* CEO was appointed in October 2025. Stability and investor confidence depend on the announcement of a permanent, highly-regarded leader.
    *   **Search Query:** `AVITA Medical permanent CEO announcement`

*   **Quantify New Market Adoption (Trauma/Vitiligo):** The massive long-term growth hinges on expanding into non-burn markets (trauma and vitiligo). Look for recent management commentary or presentation slides that provide hard numbers on:
    *   How many trauma centers have adopted RECELL for full-thickness wounds.
    *   The enrollment/progress of the vitiligo TONE study.
    *   The early adoption numbers for the new RECELL GO system.
    *   **Search Query:** `AVITA Medical RECELL trauma vitiligo adoption metrics 2026`

#### **4. Updated Financial Health and Liquidity Risk**

*   **Re-evaluate Cash Runway using Current Burn Rate:** While an older source suggests a 28-month runway based on a 2023 burn rate of $\approx$\$3.2M/month, the Q3 2025 report shows a net cash use of $\approx$\$6.2M for that quarter (or $\approx$\$2.1M/month) after an August private placement. An updated consensus for the Q4 2025/Q1 2026 cash burn is needed to confirm the *current* runway calculation, especially with the reduced revenue guidance.
    *   **Search Query:** `AVITA Medical cash burn rate Q4 2025 forecast`
