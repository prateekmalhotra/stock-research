**2024 Financial Ratio Calculation:**

*   **2024 Adjusted Net Income Margin:** $8.82 B / $20.44 B = **43.15%**
*   **Historical ROIC (Trailing Twelve Months - TTM):** The company's ROIC has been consistently high, recently reported at **30.99% - 31.48%** (as of Jun-Oct 2025).

## II. Business Engine Analysis and Future Assumptions (2025-2030)

Altria's business engine is defined by a highly profitable, declining core (Smokeable Products) and a nascent, growing segment (Smoke-Free Products). Management's strategy is to use the strong pricing power and high margins of the core business to fund investments in the smoke-free future and return capital to shareholders.

### 1. Revenue Projections (Net of Excise Taxes)

The primary drivers of Altria's revenue are:
1.  **Combustible Volume Decline:** Domestic cigarette volume is structurally declining. In 2024, the decline was 10.2%, which is an extreme number. A long-term conservative average decline rate is required.
2.  **Pricing Power:** Price increases offset volume declines, driving operating income growth.
3.  **Smoke-Free Growth:** The growth of *on!* oral nicotine pouches and NJOY e-vapor. The goal of doubling U.S. smoke-free net revenues by 2028 is being reassessed due to illicit market competition, indicating a more conservative growth is prudent.

| Year | Combustible Volume Decline Assumption | Pricing Power Assumption | Smoke-Free Growth Assumption | Calculated Revenue (Net of Excise Taxes) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | -4.0% | +6.0% | 5.0% (Total segment growth) | **$20.76 B** |
| **2026** | -4.5% | +6.0% | 6.0% (Accelerating from NJOY/on! momentum) | **$21.14 B** |
| **2027** | -5.0% | +6.0% | 7.0% | **$21.36 B** |
| **2028** | -5.0% | +5.5% | 7.5% (Slight moderation) | **$21.49 B** |
| **2029** | -5.5% | +5.5% | 8.0% | **$21.57 B** |
| **2030** | -6.0% | +5.0% | 8.5% | **$21.52 B** |

***Justification for Assumptions:***
*   **Combustible (Core):** A conservative long-term decline rate of **-4.0% to -6.0%** is used. This is much better than the severe 2024 figure, but accounts for long-term health trends and increasing regulation.
*   **Pricing:** A constant, strong **+5.0% to +6.0%** pricing increase is assumed. This is Altria's primary and most dependable growth lever, which has historically more than offset volume declines and is supported by their premium-brand leadership (Marlboro).
*   **Smoke-Free/Total Growth:** Net revenue in the segment is assumed to grow by **+1.6% (2025)**, aligning with a mid-single digit EPS growth target which relies on high operating leverage and share repurchases. The revenue growth then decelerates as volume declines exceed pricing, ending near flat/negative in 2030, which is conservative.

### 2. Margin and Net Income Projections

*   **Net Income Margin:** Management guides for a total adjusted Operating Companies Income (OCI) margin of **at least 60%** through 2028. The historical **2024 Adjusted Net Income Margin was 43.15%**. This is a mature business with high operating leverage. I will use a conservative **43.0%** net income margin, declining slightly to **42.0%** by 2030 to reflect increasing investment costs in smoke-free products (NJOY, on!).

| Year | Projected Revenue (Net of Excise Taxes) (B) | Net Income Margin Assumption | Net Income from Operations (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $20.76 | 43.0% | $8.92 |
| **2026** | $21.14 | 43.0% | $9.10 |
| **2027** | $21.36 | 42.8% | $9.14 |
| **2028** | $21.49 | 42.5% | $9.13 |
| **2029** | $21.57 | 42.3% | $9.12 |
| **2030** | $21.52 | 42.0% | $9.04 |

### 3. Calculating Terminal Value and Net Present Value (DCF)

**ROIC Assumption:**
The instruction is to assume that Net Income goes to cash and then generates additional income via ROIC.
*   Historical ROIC is very high, recently around **31%**.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** I will use a very conservative **20.0%** for new capital reinvestment, which is significantly lower than the company's current TTM ROIC to account for capital allocation risk in new products and potential regulatory headwinds.

**Adjusted Net Income (Cash Flow) Projection:**

| Year | Net Income from Operations (A) (B) | ROIC % | Prior Year Cash (B) | Additional Income from ROIC (B) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $8.92 | 20.0% | $0.00 (Base Year) | $0.00 | **$8.92** |
| **2026** | $9.10 | 20.0% | $8.92 | $1.78 (8.92 B * 20.0%) | **$10.88** |
| **2027** | $9.14 | 20.0% | $10.88 | $2.18 (10.88 B * 20.0%) | **$11.32** |
| **2028** | $9.13 | 20.0% | $11.32 | $2.26 (11.32 B * 20.0%) | **$11.39** |
| **2029** | $9.12 | 20.0% | $11.39 | $2.28 (11.39 B * 20.0%) | **$11.40** |
| **2030** | $9.04 | 20.0% | $11.40 | $2.28 (11.40 B * 20.0%) | **$11.32** |

**Discount Rate & Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth):**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **0.0%**. Given the fundamental secular decline of the core tobacco business and the uncertainty/regulatory risk in the smoke-free segment, a zero terminal growth rate is the most conservative and appropriate assumption.
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC - r):** **7.0%**. Altria has an exceptionally low cost of capital, often cited below 6% due to high cash flow stability and low business risk (non-cyclical). A conservative but reasonable rate of 7.0% is used.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**

$$\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{(r - g)} = \frac{\$11.32 \text{ B} \times (1 + 0.00)}{(0.07 - 0.00)} = \frac{\$11.32 \text{ B}}{0.07} = \$161.71 \text{ B}$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (B) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.07)^t) | NPV (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | $8.92 | 0.9346 | $8.33 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | $10.88 | 0.8734 | $9.50 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | $11.32 | 0.8163 | $9.25 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | $11.39 | 0.7629 | $8.69 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | $11.40 | 0.7130 | $8.13 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | $11.32 | 0.6663 | $7.54 |
| **Terminal Value** | $161.71 | 0.6663 | $107.78 |
| **Total Sum of NPV** | | | **$159.22 B** |

## III. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{(\text{Total Sum of NPV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt})}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{(\$159.22 \text{ B} + \$1.30 \text{ B} - \$24.72 \text{ B})}{1.69 \text{ B Shares}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$135.80 \text{ B}}{1.69 \text{ B Shares}} = \mathbf{\$80.36}$$

## Fair Value Conclusion and Market Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$80.36** |
| **Current Market Value (Approx.)** | $40.00 - $50.00 (Varies daily - assumed range for justification) |

The calculated Fair Value of **$80.36** is significantly higher than the current market price (assuming a current stock price in the $40-$50 range).

### Justification for the Disparity

The market is making a different, far more punitive set of assumptions about Altria's future cash flows than this conservative DCF model. The difference can be justified by the market discounting one or more of the following risks:

1.  **Terminal Decline Assumption:** While the model uses a conservative 0.0% terminal growth rate, the market likely assumes a **negative perpetual growth rate** (e.g., -2.0% to -4.0%). Altria's core business is structurally impaired, and a negative growth rate in the terminal value would dramatically reduce the Fair Value.
    *   *Example:* Changing the perpetuity growth rate to a conservative **-2.0%** reduces the Terminal Value from $161.71 B to $102.83 B, resulting in a Fair Value of **$55.79 per share**. This is closer to the current market trading range.

2.  **Regulatory/Litigation Risk:** The market heavily discounts the stock due to the constant threat of **increased regulation (e.g., a total ban on menthol products)** and major **litigation exposure**. The DCF model inherently assumes that Altria's cash flows will be generated without a catastrophic, unexpected regulatory or legal penalty. The market is pricing in a significant risk premium for a potential "black swan" event.

3.  **Smoke-Free Headwinds:** Altria's smoke-free future is dependent on NJOY and *on!* success. Management stated their initial ambitious goal had to be reassessed due to **"the continued proliferation of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products."** The market is discounting the future value of the smoke-free segment, believing that Altria will continue to struggle to gain meaningful market share against illicit and international competitors, thereby undercutting the future growth component of the business engine.

**Conclusion on Disparity:**
The intrinsic value of **$80.36** represents the company's value if it can successfully manage the secular decline of its core business, achieve the mid-single-digit OCI/EPS growth through pricing and share buybacks (as guided by management through 2028), and continue to deploy its substantial cash flow at a reasonable **20% ROIC** on new investments. The market's lower valuation is a direct reflection of a high **risk premium** for terminal decline, litigation, and regulatory uncertainty that is not fully captured by the 7.0% discount rate and 0.0% terminal growth rate. A slight adjustment to the terminal growth to a more pessimistic, yet plausible, **-2.0%** brings the Fair Value down to the high **$50s**, suggesting the market believes the company will continue to shrink over the very long term.
