### II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

Insteel Industries is the nation’s largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction. Its revenue engine is driven by volume (shipments) and pricing/spreads (between selling price and raw material cost) within its core end markets: non-residential construction (including infrastructure), which accounted for approximately 85% of sales in fiscal 2025, and residential construction (15%).

The key future drivers are:
1.  **Infrastructure Spending:** The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is a multi-year catalyst, with management citing this as a support for continued growth into 2027. This underpins long-term volume growth in its core market.
2.  **Specialty Markets:** Growth in data center construction is a specific, strong demand driver mentioned by management.
3.  **Efficiency/Spreads:** The company is an FIFO reporter, meaning stable or increasing spreads between raw material (wire rod) and selling prices are critical. Capital expenditure of approximately \$20.0 million in FY 2026 is focused on cost and productivity improvements, which will support margins.

The valuation uses a **conservative and decelerating growth model** to reflect the cyclical nature of the construction industry, balancing the current positive infrastructure tailwind with long-term industrial maturity.

#### A. Revenue Projection (USD in millions)

| Fiscal Year | Starting Revenue | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | - | - | \$647.7 | Actual reported Net Sales. |
| **2026** | \$647.7 | **5.0%** | \$680.1 | Reflects near-term "solid opportunity" and ramp-up of infrastructure/data center projects. Assumes modest volume (shipment) growth. |
| **2027** | \$680.1 | **4.0%** | \$707.3 | Continued, but moderating, benefit from the IIJA and commercial construction projects. |
| **2028** | \$707.3 | **2.0%** | \$721.5 | Begins normalization to a conservative long-term growth rate for a cyclical, mature industrial company. |
| **2029** | \$721.5 | **2.0%** | \$735.9 | Conservative long-term growth. |
| **2030** | \$735.9 | **2.0%** | \$750.6 | Conservative long-term growth. |

#### B. Margin and Net Income Projection

The FY 2025 Net Income Margin was 6.33% (\$41.0M / \$647.7M). To be conservative and account for industry cyclicality and price volatility, the margin is modeled to decelerate to a lower long-term average of 5.0% after the peak infrastructure-driven period.

| Fiscal Year | Projected Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | \$647.7 | 6.33% | \$41.0 |
| **2026** | \$680.1 | **6.3%** | \$42.8 | Near-term benefit from recent stronger spreads and cost control. |
| **2027** | \$707.3 | **5.8%** | \$41.0 | Slight moderation as price spreads face inevitable cyclical pressure. |
| **2028** | \$721.5 | **5.5%** | \$39.7 | Continued cyclical margin compression. |
| **2029** | \$735.9 | **5.0%** | \$36.8 | Modeling a return to a conservative, long-term industry average margin. |
| **2030** | \$750.6 | **5.0%** | \$37.5 | Conservative long-term average margin. |

#### C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

**1. Cash Flow Model (Net Income + ROIC):**

*   **Assumption:** Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) Assumption:** Since the company is debt-free and generates cash, a very conservative, positive ROIC of **4.0%** is used on the cumulative retained cash balance. This reflects a low-risk, internal rate of return on capital, which is a key management focus.

| Fiscal Year | Net Income (A) | Cash In-Hand (Start of Year) (B) | ROIC on Cash (B x 4.0%) (C) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$42.8 | \$15.6 (Initial Cash) | \$0.6 | **\$43.4** |
| **2027** | \$41.0 | \$58.4 (15.6 + 42.8) | \$2.3 | **\$43.3** |
| **2028** | \$39.7 | \$99.4 (58.4 + 41.0) | \$4.0 | **\$43.7** |
| **2029** | \$36.8 | \$139.1 (99.4 + 39.7) | \$5.6 | **\$42.4** |
| **2030** | \$37.5 | \$175.9 (139.1 + 36.8) | \$7.0 | **\$44.5** |

*(Note: Cash in-hand for 2026 is the initial cash. The cash from 2026 Net Income is added to the balance for the 2027 calculation, etc. The ROIC component is calculated from the *prior* year's accrued cash (Initial Cash + Prior Net Income Accruals). Dividends and share repurchases are disregarded to maintain a conservative net income-to-cash flow model.)*

**2. Terminal Value Calculation (2030 onwards):**

*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **1.5%** (Very conservative, below long-term GDP/inflation, for a mature, cyclical industry).
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **8.0%** (Conservative, reasonable WACC for a debt-free industrial company, assuming a higher cost of equity due to business cyclicality).
*   **Perpetuity Formula:** [Cash Flow 2030 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Value:** [ \$44.5M * (1 + 0.015) ] / (0.080 - 0.015) = **\$693.3 million**

**3. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

The Net Present Value (NPV) is the sum of the discounted cash flows for the explicit forecast period (2026-2030) and the discounted Terminal Value.

| Year | Cash Flow (USD in millions) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$43.4 | 0.9259 | \$40.2 |
| **2027** | \$43.3 | 0.8573 | \$37.1 |
| **2028** | \$43.7 | 0.7938 | \$34.7 |
| **2029** | \$42.4 | 0.7350 | \$31.2 |
| **2030** | \$44.5 | 0.6806 | \$30.3 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | \$693.3 | 0.6806 | \$471.8 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$645.3 million** |

### III. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value is calculated using the Equity Value formula:

**Equity Value** = Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Current Cash - Total Debt

*   **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows:** \$645.3 million
*   **Current Cash:** \$15.6 million
*   **Total Debt:** \$0

**Equity Value** = \$645.3 million + \$15.6 million - \$0 = **\$660.9 million**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

*   **Shares Outstanding:** 19,416,462 (19.416 million)

**Fair Value Per Share** = \$660.9 million / 19.416 million shares = **\$34.04**

### IV. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share is \$34.04**.

**Market Comparison and Justification:**

*   **Fair Value:** \$34.04
*   **Current Stock Price:** [Current IIIN Stock Price]

If the current market price of IIIN stock is significantly different from \$34.04, it suggests the market is making a different set of assumptions about the future of the company.

**If the Market Price is Higher than \$34.04:**

The market is likely assuming one or more of the following:
1.  **Higher Terminal Growth:** The market anticipates that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and related secular growth (e.g., data centers) will have a longer-lasting impact, leading to a terminal growth rate higher than the conservative 1.5% used here. For example, a 2.5% terminal growth rate would push the valuation up considerably.
2.  **Higher Long-Term Margins:** The market believes that the company's cost and productivity initiatives (supported by CapEx) will result in a sustainable, higher long-term Net Income Margin, perhaps averaging 6.5% or more, even through a cyclical downturn.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** Given the company's pristine, debt-free balance sheet and strong cash position, the market might be applying a lower Cost of Equity (and thus a lower WACC) than the conservative 8.0% used in this analysis.

**If the Market Price is Lower than \$34.04:**

The market's assumptions would be more bearish, suggesting:
1.  **Imminent Cyclical Downturn:** The market is discounting the near-term benefits of the infrastructure spending and instead pricing in an immediate, severe cyclical downturn in non-residential construction, leading to lower Net Income Margins (e.g., < 4.0%) in the near term.
2.  **Increased Raw Material Volatility/Competition:** The market may be concerned about rising raw material costs (wire rod) and aggressive import competition, which will compress the pricing spreads and quickly erode profitability despite volume increases.
3.  **Lower ROIC/Inefficient Capital Allocation:** Despite the focus on "Return on Capital," the market may be skeptical of the company's ability to efficiently reinvest its growing cash pile, assuming a lower or zero return (ROIC < 4.0%).

**The conservatism of this analysis is primarily housed in:**
*   The sharp deceleration of the Net Income Margin from 6.3% to a flat 5.0% by 2029, which builds in an inevitable cyclical decline.
*   The very conservative 1.5% Terminal Growth Rate.
*   The relatively high 8.0% Discount Rate for a debt-free company.

**The Fair Value Per Share is \$34.04.**
