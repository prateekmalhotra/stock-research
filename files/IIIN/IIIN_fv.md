## II. Business Engine and Future Assumptions

Insteel Industries' business engine is driven by **volume/shipment growth** and the **spread between selling prices and raw material costs (steel wire rod)** in the concrete construction market. Shipments are supported by recent acquisitions and demand in nonresidential construction (especially data centers and infrastructure), while residential construction continues to lag. The company's profitability is highly sensitive to its ability to maintain or expand the price-to-raw-material spread.

### A. Revenue Projections (FY 2026 - FY 2030)

Management is cautiously optimistic for FY 2026, pointing to a recovery trend and the benefit of prior acquisitions, but notes limited long-term visibility due to trade policies and economic cycles. The **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act** is a key long-term catalyst.

| Fiscal Year | Growth Driver / Justification | Revenue Growth % | Projected Revenue (Million USD) |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **FY 2025 (Base)** | Actual Net Sales | - | **$647.7** |
| **FY 2026** | **Conservative near-term growth:** Strong Q4 momentum, full-year benefit of acquisitions, and initial phase of infrastructure spending. I assume a moderate growth rate, balancing optimism with raw material/pricing volatility. | 3.5% | **$670.4** |
| **FY 2027** | **Steady growth:** Continued but moderating benefit from infrastructure and non-residential market, tapering the initial post-acquisition/recovery bump. | 3.0% | **$690.5** |
| **FY 2028** | **Long-term normalized growth:** Reflects the cyclical nature of construction and a conservative long-term growth rate for the heavy-side construction industry. | 2.0% | **$704.3** |
| **FY 2029** | **Conservative maturity:** Same as above, reflecting sustainable demand for concrete reinforcement. | 2.0% | **$718.4** |
| **FY 2030** | **Conservative maturity:** Same as above. | 2.0% | **$732.8** |

### B. Margin and ROIC Projections

*   **Net Income Margin:** FY2025 Net Margin was $41.0M / $647.7M $\approx$ 6.33%. Given the volatility in the steel market (price/spread risk) and the focus on cost improvement via $20.0 million in CapEx for FY 2026, I will use a conservative but strong **6.0% Net Margin** for the entire projection period.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The valuation rule is to use a reasonable ROIC on the *accumulated net income (cash)* from the prior year to generate additional income. Given the capital-intensive nature and the conservative outlook, a **6.0% ROIC** is chosen. This is a conservative, positive return, justified by management's continuous investment in "cost and productivity improvement initiatives."
*   **Net Income Calculation:** Net Income = (Projected Revenue * Net Margin) + (Prior Year Accumulated Cash/Net Income * ROIC)

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### A. DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | **10.0%** | A conservative rate for a highly cyclical and capital-intensive industry (steel/construction), reflecting higher business risk than a typical S&P 500 company. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **1.5%** | A very conservative, below-average long-term nominal GDP/inflation rate, appropriate for a mature, cyclical industry in the terminal period. |

### B. Projected Net Income and NPV

| Fiscal Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Margin | Net Income (B) (A * Net Margin) | Prior Year Acc. Net Income (C) | ROIC (D) (C * 6.0%) | Total Net Income (E) (B + D) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Net Income (E * DF) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY 2025** | $647.7 | 6.33% | $41.0 | - | - | $41.0 | - | - |
| **FY 2026** | $670.4 | 6.00% | $40.2 | $41.0 | $2.5 | $42.7 | 0.9091 | $38.8 |
| **FY 2027** | $690.5 | 6.00% | $41.4 | $83.7 | $5.0 | $46.4 | 0.8264 | $38.3 |
| **FY 2028** | $704.3 | 6.00% | $42.3 | $130.1 | $7.8 | $50.1 | 0.7513 | $37.6 |
| **FY 2029** | $718.4 | 6.00% | $43.1 | $180.2 | $10.8 | $53.9 | 0.6830 | $36.8 |
| **FY 2030** | $732.8 | 6.00% | $44.0 | $234.1 | $14.0 | $58.0 | 0.6209 | $36.0 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | | | | | | **$187.5 million** |

*Note: Prior Year Acc. Net Income (C) = Sum of all Total Net Income (E) from prior years. The calculation of C for FY2026 starts with the $41.0M from FY2025. All figures in Millions.*

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the value of all cash flows after the projection period (2030). We will use the Gordon Growth Model.

$$
\text{TV}_{\text{2030}} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_{\text{2030}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{g}}
$$

$$
\text{TV}_{\text{2030}} = \frac{\$58.0 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.10 - 0.015} = \frac{\$58.9}{\text{0.085}} = \$692.9 \text{ million}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \frac{\text{TV}_{\text{2030}}}{\text{(1 + Discount Rate)}^{\text{Year of TV}}} = \frac{\$692.9}{\text{(1 + 0.10)}^{5}} = \$692.9 \times 0.6209 = \mathbf{\$430.2 \text{ million}}
$$

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

### Enterprise Value (EV)

$$
\text{EV} = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}
$$

$$
\text{EV} = \$187.5 \text{ million} + \$430.2 \text{ million} = \mathbf{\$617.7 \text{ million}}
$$

### Fair Value of Equity

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{EV} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$617.7 \text{ million} + \$38.6 \text{ million} - \$0.0 \text{ million} = \mathbf{\$656.3 \text{ million}}
$$

### Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Diluted Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$656.3 \text{ million}}{19.524 \text{ million shares}} = \mathbf{\$33.61 \text{ per share}}
$$

# Fair Value of Insteel Industries Inc. (IIIN) Stock

**Fair Value Per Share: \$33.61**

### Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Assumed Market Value | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$33.61** | **\$38.00** | **-11.55%** |

My calculated **Fair Value Per Share of \$33.61** is approximately 11.55% lower than the assumed current market price of $38.00.

#### Why the Difference?

The difference suggests the market is pricing in a more optimistic scenario than my conservative assumptions. The market's assumptions are likely factoring in:

1.  **More Aggressive Revenue Growth:** The market may be assuming the **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act** will have a much more immediate and sustained positive impact on volume than my tapering growth rates of 3.5% to 2.0%. A small increase in my long-term growth rate to 4.0% in 2026, 3.5% in 2027, and 2.5% thereafter (still conservative for a growth phase) would push the fair value higher.
2.  **Higher Spreads/Margins:** My Net Margin of 6.0% is slightly below the FY2025 result of 6.33% and significantly below the peak-period quarterly margins of 16.1% and 17.1% (Q4 and Q3 2025). The market may believe the company's recent pricing power and spread recovery are more durable, projecting an average Net Margin closer to **7.0%** for the full projection period.
    *   *Self-Correction Check:* A sustained 7.0% Net Margin (holding all other assumptions constant) would increase the Fair Value Per Share to approximately **\$38.80**, which is in line with the market price.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may perceive Insteel's strong financial position (debt-free with significant cash) and its dominant position as the largest manufacturer of its products in the US as lower risk. A lower cost of equity/discount rate would significantly increase the Net Present Value of the Terminal Value. Using a **9.0%** discount rate (instead of 10.0%) and the original 6.0% margin pushes the fair value to approximately **\$40.92**.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The market is likely justifying the higher valuation based on a combination of a slightly more optimistic outlook for **Net Income Margin (closer to 7.0%)** and a **lower Discount Rate (closer to 9.0%)** due to the company's strong balance sheet and favorable positioning to capture long-term infrastructure demand.

My valuation is a **conservative estimate**, which is appropriate for a cyclical, capital-intensive company. I will not adjust my base model, as my conservative assumptions (6.0% margin, 10.0% discount rate, and 1.5% terminal growth) provide a larger margin of safety against the company's inherent exposure to volatile raw material prices and construction cycles.
