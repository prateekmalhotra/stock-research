## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Tronox is a global, vertically integrated producer of **Titanium Dioxide (TiO2)** pigment and **Zircon**. TiO2 is a commodity whose demand is closely tied to global GDP and industrial production (paints, plastics, paper). The company is currently in a cyclical downturn characterized by destocking, weak demand, and competitive pricing pressures.

### Business Engine Assumptions

1.  **Cyclical Recovery:** The TiO2 cycle is expected to recover, as evidenced by management commentary noting a sequential increase in Q4 2025 volumes as a "front end of a recovery." A recessionary low point in 2025 precedes a stronger 2026/2027.
2.  **Cost Rationalization:** The business engine will be driven by improved margins from cost-cutting initiatives. Management is targeting **\$125 million to \$175 million** in annualized savings by the end of 2026, primarily from operational efficiency and the closure of the Botlek plant. We will use the conservative end of **\$125 million** to model margin improvement.
3.  **Long-Term Growth:** Beyond the recovery, a conservative long-term growth rate for a commodity chemical like TiO2 is low, aligning with global GDP growth.

### Revenue Projections (Millions of USD)

| Year | Rationale | Projected Growth | Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | Use the conservative end of the full-year guidance range (\$3.0 - \$3.1B) from Q2/Q3 2025. | -3.2% (vs. FY 2024 \$3.1B) | **\$3,000** |
| **2026 (E)** | Strong initial cyclical recovery + full benefit of Q4 2025 volume ramp. Below peak revenue (e.g., FY 2022 was \$3.58B). | +15.0% | **\$3,450** |
| **2027 (E)** | Continued strong recovery, full realization of cost savings, and market rebalancing (e.g., competitor insolvency mentioned as a future benefit). | +10.0% | **\$3,795** |
| **2028 (E)** | Mature phase of the cycle; growth slows down. | +3.0% | **\$3,909** |
| **2029 (E)** | Growth stabilizes towards a long-term rate, slightly above conservative GDP. | +2.5% | **\$4,007** |
| **2030 (E)** | Continuation of conservative long-term growth rate. | +2.0% | **\$4,087** |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

Net Income Margin will be a key driver, as the company is currently unprofitable (Net Loss of \$48M in FY 2024, \$99M in Q3 2025). We must project a recovery in profitability based on management's cost-saving guidance and increased operating rates.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin % (B) | Cost Savings (C) | Net Income before ROIC (D = A * B + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | \$3,000 | -1.5% | \$60 (partial savings) | **\$15** |
| **2026 (E)** | \$3,450 | 3.0% | \$125 (full run-rate savings) | **\$238.5** |
| **2027 (E)** | \$3,795 | 4.5% | \$125 | **\$295.75** |
| **2028 (E)** | \$3,909 | 5.5% | \$125 | **\$340.00** |
| **2029 (E)** | \$4,007 | 6.0% | \$125 | **\$365.42** |
| **2030 (E)** | \$4,087 | 6.0% | \$125 | **\$370.22** |

**Justification for Margins:**
*   **2025:** A net loss is projected to turn into a small profit (\$15M) due to the first tranche of cost savings (assuming \$60M of the \$125M is realized) despite the weak market, reflecting a deeply conservative start.
*   **2026:** Net Income Margin is modeled to recover to 3.0% (from -1.5% in 2025) plus the full \$125M in annual savings from the efficiency program, reflecting the start of the cyclical recovery and the full impact of cost cuts.
*   **2027-2030:** Margins conservatively peak at **6.0%**. This is well below the company's historical peak margins and reflects a cautious long-term view for a capital-intensive commodity business while still benefiting from the vertical integration and operational improvements.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### Assumptions
*   **ROIC Assumption:** We assume a conservative **5.0%** ROIC. While the company has had periods of negative net income, 5.0% is a reasonable and conservative floor for a capital-intensive business in the recovery phase, significantly lower than the company's past high-cycle ROIC figures.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A conservative long-term growth rate of **1.0%** is used. This is well below global GDP and the company's projected 2030 growth, reflecting a very cautious terminal value assumption for a mature commodity business.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative discount rate of **9.0%** is used. This is a reasonable WACC estimate for a company with a high debt load and cyclical revenue, balancing the cost of debt and equity.

### Projected Cash Flow (Net Income Conversion) and NPV

**Rule Applied:** Net Income for next year = (Net Income from that year) + (ROIC * Net Income converted to cash from previous year).

| Year | Net Income before ROIC (A) | Cash from Previous Year (B) | ROIC Income (C = 5.0% * B) | Final Net Income (A+C) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$15 | \$0 | \$0 | **\$15.00** | 0.9174 | \$13.76 |
| **2026** | \$238.5 | \$15.00 | \$0.75 | **\$239.25** | 0.8417 | \$201.37 |
| **2027** | \$295.75 | \$254.25 | \$12.71 | **\$308.46** | 0.7722 | \$238.11 |
| **2028** | \$340.00 | \$562.71 | \$28.14 | **\$368.14** | 0.7084 | \$260.80 |
| **2029** | \$365.42 | \$930.85 | \$46.54 | **\$411.96** | 0.6499 | \$267.73 |
| **2030** | \$370.22 | \$1,342.81 | \$67.14 | **\$437.36** | 0.5963 | \$260.78 |
| **Sub-Total NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **\$1,242.55** |

*Note: Cash from Previous Year (B) is the cumulative sum of all Final Net Income (A+C) from prior years (e.g., for 2027, B = 2025 Final NI + 2026 Final NI = $15.00 + $239.25 = $254.25).*

### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

$$
\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Final Net Income (2030)} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{TV} = \frac{\$437.36 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.09 - 0.01} = \frac{\$441.73}{\mathbf{0.08}} = \mathbf{\$5,521.63} \text{ Million}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor (2030)}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \$5,521.63 \times 0.5963 = \mathbf{\$3,293.00} \text{ Million}
$$

### Total Net Present Value (NPV)

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \text{Sub-Total NPV} + \text{NPV of TV}
$$

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \$1,242.55 \text{ Million} + \$3,293.00 \text{ Million} = \mathbf{\$4,535.55} \text{ Million}
$$

## 6. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (TROX)** | **\$9.59** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$26.35 (As of February 13, 2026)** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

My calculated fair value of **\$9.59** is significantly lower than the market price of **\$26.35**. This large discrepancy suggests that **the market is pricing in a much faster, stronger, and longer-lasting cyclical recovery with higher margins** than my conservative model assumes.

**Market Assumptions vs. My Conservative Assumptions:**

| Factor | Conservative Model Assumption | Market Implied Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Slow ramp from 2025 to 2.0% terminal growth. | Faster return to peak revenue (e.g., 2022's \$3.58B) and sustained higher growth. |
| **Net Income Margin** | Peak margin of **6.0%** (plus cost savings). | Assumes a full return to historical mid-cycle or peak-cycle margins (e.g., 10%+). |
| **ROIC/Reinvestment** | Only 5.0% ROIC on converted cash. | Assumes highly efficient capital allocation and a much higher ROIC due to the benefits of vertical integration. |
| **Terminal Value** | Low 1.0% Terminal Growth Rate. | Assumes a much higher terminal growth rate (3%+) or a lower Discount Rate, significantly boosting the valuation. |

**The market is likely betting on:**

1.  **A sharp V-shaped recovery in TiO2 pricing:** The market believes the current destocking cycle is near its end and that aggressive price increases will materialize quickly in 2026/2027, well surpassing my assumed revenue growth.
2.  **Full realization of strategic benefits:** The market gives full credit to the vertical integration model, the \$125M+ in cost savings, and potential future value from the rare earth strategy, leading to a structural improvement in profitability (higher Net Income Margins) versus the previous cycle.
3.  **Cyclical Peak Pricing:** The market is likely pricing TROX not on a mid-cycle or through-cycle average, but closer to the value it would have at the next cyclical peak, which could be 2027-2028 based on my model's recovery timeline.

**Conclusion:** My conservative valuation, which assumes a slow recovery and modest long-term profitability for a highly cyclical commodity business, indicates the stock is currently **overvalued** based on intrinsic cash flows alone. The current market price reflects high investor optimism regarding the magnitude and duration of the next cyclical upswing, coupled with the permanent structural cost improvements outlined by management.
