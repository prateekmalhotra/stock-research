### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Tronox is a vertically integrated producer of Titanium Dioxide ($\text{TiO}_2$) pigment, a commodity business highly dependent on the global economic cycle (specifically construction and automotive demand) and the resulting supply/demand balance for $\text{TiO}_2$ and its feedstock, Zircon.

**Business Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Cyclical Recovery (Volume & Price):** The company is currently in a cyclical trough, evidenced by a negative net income in Q1 and Q2 2025 and revised-down 2025 guidance. The core driver for future revenue is a recovery in $\text{TiO}_2$ demand/volume and subsequent pricing power. The market expects a H2 2025 recovery that was already softer than expected, so a strong, conservative recovery will be modeled for 2026 and 2027.
2.  **Cost Improvement Program:** Management is focused on a cost improvement program expected to deliver **\$125 million to \$175 million** in sustainable, run-rate cost improvements by the end of 2026. This will be the primary driver for margin expansion.
3.  **Vertical Integration/Stability:** Tronox's vertical integration provides a cost advantage, allowing it to better weather cyclical downturns.
4.  **Long-Term Growth:** The $\text{TiO}_2$ market is tied to global GDP growth. A conservative long-term growth rate is used after the initial recovery phase.

**Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030) (Millions of USD):**

| Year | Basis / Assumption | $\text{TiO}_2$ Cycle Stage | Revenue Projection | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | Net Sales from 2024 10-K (Step 1 Search) | Trough | \$3,074 | N/A |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | Midpoint of revised 2025 guidance (\$3.0B - \$3.1B). | Deep Trough | **\$3,050** | -0.8% |
| **2026** | **Recovery Year 1:** Strong volume recovery and initial price firming, plus realization of half the cost savings program benefits. A 10% increase is conservative for a cyclical upswing. | Recovery | **\$3,355** | 10.0% |
| **2027** | **Recovery Year 2:** Continued volume and price strength in the peak of the cycle, combined with full realization of cost improvements. | Peak Recovery | **\$3,758** | 12.0% |
| **2028** | **Peak/Initial Softening:** Revenue growth moderates as pricing power fades from the peak. | Softening | **\$3,871** | 3.0% |
| **2029** | **Moderation:** Growth settles toward long-term global GDP/industrial output. | Normal Cycle | **\$3,987** | 3.0% |
| **2030** | **Long-Term Rate:** Conservative long-term growth rate for a mature, industrial commodity business. | Normal Cycle | **\$4,067** | 2.0% |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

The Net Income margin is the most volatile variable due to the cyclical nature of the business and the high fixed-cost structure. The key margin driver is the realization of the **\$125M - \$175M** in cost savings by the end of 2026.

**Margin Assumptions:**

*   **2025:** Uses the midpoint of the revised Adjusted EBITDA guidance (\$435M), reflecting the challenging market. The resulting Net Income loss reflects the ongoing cyclical downturn.
*   **2026 - 2027:** Net Income Margin expands significantly due to high volume/price leverage in the upswing and the full impact of the $\text{Q4 2026}$ run-rate cost savings.
*   **2028 - 2030:** Margin stabilizes to a conservative, long-term average (4.0\% - 5.0\%) for a commodity chemical producer through a full cycle.

| Year | Revenue (\$M) | Adj. EBITDA Guidance | Adj. EBITDA Margin | Interest Exp. (Assumed) | D&A (Assumed) | **Net Income Margin** | **Net Income (Projected) (\$M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$3,074 | \$564 (Est.) | 18.3% | \$200 | \$200 | **-1.8%** | \$(54) |
| **2025** | \$3,050 | \$435 (Midpoint) | 14.3% | \$200 | \$200 | **-2.5%** | \$(76) |
| **2026** | \$3,355 | N/A | 18.0% | \$200 | \$200 | **1.8%** | \$60 |
| **2027** | \$3,758 | N/A | 22.0% | \$200 | \$200 | **4.7%** | \$177 |
| **2028** | \$3,871 | N/A | 21.0% | \$200 | \$200 | **4.4%** | \$170 |
| **2029** | \$3,987 | N/A | 20.0% | \$200 | \$200 | **4.0%** | \$159 |
| **2030** | \$4,067 | N/A | 20.0% | \$200 | \$200 | **4.0%** | \$163 |

***Notes:***
*   *Interest Expense:* Kept flat at a conservative \$200M/year, reflecting the high debt load and fixed rate swaps.
*   *D&A:* Kept flat at a conservative \$200M/year.
*   *Net Income Approximation:* For modeling purposes, $\text{NI} \approx \text{EBITDA} - \text{D\&A} - \text{Interest}$.

### IV. Net Income with Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

The ROIC metric rewards the company for compounding earnings. I will calculate a forward Net Income that includes a conservative return on the previous year's retained earnings (cash from NI).

*   **Historical ROIC:** The company's trailing 12-month Net Leverage was 6.1x in Q2 2025, and it has been unprofitable in recent periods.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** A conservative positive ROIC of **3.0\%** is used on all retained net income for the following year's additional income, acknowledging the potential for positive future returns from a vertically integrated asset base when the cycle turns.

| Year | Net Income (Base) (\$M) | Cash Retained (Previous Year) (\$M) | ROIC (3.0%) on Retained Cash (\$M) | **Net Income (Adjusted) (\$M) [Cash Flow]** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$(76) | \$0 | \$0 | \$(76) |
| **2026** | \$60 | \$(76) | \$(2.3) | \$58 |
| **2027** | \$177 | \$(18) | \$(0.5) | \$176 |
| **2028** | \$170 | \$158 | \$4.7 | \$175 |
| **2029** | \$159 | \$333 | \$10.0 | \$169 |
| **2030** | \$163 | \$502 | \$15.1 | **\$178** |

### V. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income (Adjusted) for each year is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), as instructed.

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** Given the high net leverage (6.1x) and cyclical nature of the business, a high-risk rate is necessary. A conservative **10.0\%** is chosen.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth Rate):** For a mature, cyclical commodity company, the long-term growth rate should not exceed global GDP. A very conservative rate of **1.0\%** is used.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
$$\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$
$$\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$178 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01} = \frac{\$179.78 \text{M}}{0.09} = \$1,997.56 \text{M}$$

**NPV Calculation:**

| Year | Cash Flow (\$M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of CF (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | \$(76) | 0.9091 | \$(69) |
| 2026 | \$58 | 0.8264 | \$48 |
| 2027 | \$176 | 0.7513 | \$132 |
| 2028 | \$175 | 0.6830 | \$119 |
| 2029 | \$169 | 0.6209 | \$105 |
| 2030 (Base) | \$178 | 0.5645 | \$101 |
| 2030 (TV) | \$1,998 | 0.5645 | \$1,128 |
| **Sum of NPV (Projected CF + TV)** | | | **\$1,564** |

### VI. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

The Fair Value is calculated by taking the sum of the Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows, adding the current cash, and subtracting the total debt.

| Metric | Value (Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A. NPV of Future Cash Flows (2025 - Terminal)** | **\$1,564** |
| B. Current Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$132 |
| C. Total Debt | \$3,100 |
| **Total Equity Value (A + B - C)** | **\$(1,404)** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 158.52 |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Total Equity / Shares)** | **\$(8.86)** |

**Fair Value Per Share: $\$(8.86)$**

**Current Stock Price (October 31, 2025): \$3.50**

---

### VII. Justification and Market Interpretation

The calculated Fair Value of $\$(8.86)$ suggests that, under these conservative assumptions, the equity value is **negative**, meaning the debt burden outweighs the net present value of all future cash flows. However, the stock currently trades at **\$3.50** per share.

**Justification for the Disparity (Why is the Market Trading at \$3.50?):**

The significant difference between the calculated negative fair value and the market price highlights that **the market is pricing in a much faster and more robust cyclical recovery than the conservative DCF model assumes.**

1.  **Market Assumption on Cyclical Recovery (The Business Engine):**
    *   **DCF Assumption:** The model assumes the current trough (2025) is deep, leading to a negative starting cash flow, and then projects a robust but *conservative* recovery in 2026-2027 (10\% and 12\% revenue growth, 4\%+ Net Income Margin).
    *   **Market Assumption:** The market believes the cyclical recovery will be **much stronger and sooner**, leading to *significantly* higher Net Income Margins (e.g., 6\%-8\%) and *higher* peak revenues (\$4.5B+) in 2026-2027. The $\text{TiO}_2$ industry has historically seen very high profit margins during peak cycles, and the market is pricing in the full, optimistic value of that peak.
2.  **Market Assumption on Cost Savings and Vertical Integration:**
    *   The market is likely fully factoring in the **\$125M - \$175M** in sustainable cost savings by the end of 2026, leading to a permanent structural reduction in the cost base and a higher floor for profitability in future cycles.
3.  **Market Assumption on Debt Refinancing/Solvency:**
    *   The market is not concerned about the high debt load (\$3.1B) because the next major maturity is not until 2029, allowing the company time to capitalize on the expected cyclical recovery to generate sufficient cash flow for debt paydown or favorable refinancing. The DCF is conservative by not explicitly modeling debt paydown and using a high discount rate due to the risk.
4.  **Market Assumption on Terminal Value:**
    *   A conservative 1.0\% terminal growth rate is likely too low for the market's expectation. The market is likely pricing in a terminal value that assumes a return to profitability and a much higher long-term growth rate for the underlying business due to the vertical integration and cost improvements, which significantly raises the overall NPV.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated negative fair value of **\$(8.86)** is a reflection of a DCF model that is highly sensitive to the high debt load (\$3.1B) and an unfavorable starting point (a cyclical trough with negative profitability). The market price of **\$3.50** reflects a fundamentally different and **optimistic** assumption about the magnitude and velocity of the commodity cycle's recovery. The market essentially views TROX as a highly leveraged call option on the $\text{TiO}_2$ cycle, expecting a massive surge in cash flows (margins and volume) to quickly pay down debt and restore a positive equity value.
