## Valuation of Perrigo Company plc (PRGO) Stock

The valuation of Perrigo Company plc (PRGO) will be performed using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology based on projected Net Income. The projections are built upon a conservative interpretation of the company's "One Perrigo" strategy, Project Energize, Supply Chain Reinvention, and explicit management guidance as found in recent SEC filings and earnings call transcripts.

### I. Initial Financial Data (From SEC Filings and Press Releases)

The following figures are the most recent and relevant data for the calculation, sourced from the latest company reporting.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source Date | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** (C0) | \$559 million | Dec 31, 2024 | Most recent end-of-year figure, reflecting post-refinancing and debt redemption balances. |
| **Total Debt** (D0) | \$4,100 million | Jun 29, 2024 | The figure reported in the Q2 2024 release, which management expects to be the stable total long-term debt after the refinancing activities are complete (as the refinancing was structured to keep total debt flat). |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 137.6 million | Recent Q-filing data | A consistently reported figure in recent reports. |
| **FY 2024 Net Sales** (Base) | \$4,700 million | FY 2023 Actuals | Used a conservative figure, flat from 2023 Net Sales, as the 2024 outlook was for "flat" total net sales growth. |
| **Historical ROIC (TTM)** | 3.90% | Recent Analyst Data | Used to set the conservative future ROIC assumption. |

### II. Business Engine Analysis and Future Assumptions

The core of Perrigo's business engine is its transformation into a pure-play consumer self-care company, executing its **"One Perrigo"** blueprint and **"3S" plan** (Stabilize, Streamline, Scale). The financial projections are based on the expected realization of benefits from two major initiatives: **Project Energize** and the **Supply Chain Reinvention Program**, which are intended to drive margin expansion and operating leverage.

#### A. Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

| Year | Growth Driver / Rationale | Assumption | Net Sales (millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Base) | Flat sales (Conservative vs. prior year) | - | \$4,700 |
| **2025** | Low-end of management's all-in net sales growth guidance (1.0%); infant formula headwind is fully offset; benefits of Project Energize begin. | **1.0%** | \$4,747 |
| **2026** | Organic growth from "rest of the business" (Q1 2024) plus continued, conservative benefit from accretive initiatives (Energize/Supply Chain). | **2.0%** | \$4,842 |
| **2027** | Steady organic growth as transformation matures. | **2.0%** | \$4,939 |
| **2028** | Growth moderates toward long-term maturity rate. | **1.5%** | \$5,013 |
| **2029** | Growth moderates further. | **1.0%** | \$5,063 |
| **2030** | Near-terminal growth rate. | **1.0%** | \$5,114 |

*   **Justification:** The 2025 revenue growth is anchored to the low end of management's 1% to 3% full-year net sales growth guidance. For the following years, a conservative rate of 2.0% declining to 1.0% is used, which is only slightly above the **+0.9 percentage points** organic growth reported for the "rest of the business" (excluding infant formula volatility and SKU prioritization) in Q1 2024, reflecting the non-linear benefit of restructuring initiatives over time, without relying on aggressive market expansion.

#### B. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

| Year | Metric | 2024 (Implied) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin** | % of Net Sales | 7.9% | **8.5%** | **9.0%** | **9.3%** | **9.6%** | **9.8%** | **10.0%** |

*   **2025 Net Income Justification:** Management guided Adjusted EPS to \$2.90 - \$3.10 for FY 2025. Using the low end: \$2.90 EPS * 137.6 million shares = \$398.9 million Net Income. This equates to an **8.5%** Net Income Margin (\$398.9M / \$4,747M).
*   **2026-2030 Net Income Margin Justification:** Management is guiding for adjusted gross margin to approach 40% and adjusted operating margin to approach 15%. The increasing Net Income margin from 8.5% to a terminal 10.0% is a conservative projection that acknowledges the expected operating leverage and margin expansion from Project Energize and Supply Chain Reinvention, but is also tempered by expected non-operating costs (interest and taxes).

#### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation

The Net Income for the following year is calculated as:
**Net Income for Next Year** = Projected Net Income from Revenue/Margin + (Net Income from Previous Year * ROIC)

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **4.0%** (Slightly higher than the historical 3.90% TTM ROIC to reflect improved efficiency from the restructuring programs, but still very conservative for a recovering company).

| Year | Net Sales (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Ops (B) | Retained NI (Prior Year) (C) | ROIC (4.0%) on C (D) | Total Net Income (B+D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Base) | \$4,700 | 7.9% | \$371.3 | - | - | \$371.3 |
| **2025** | \$4,747 | 8.5% | \$403.5 | \$371.3 | \$14.9 | \$418.4 |
| **2026** | \$4,842 | 9.0% | \$435.8 | \$418.4 | \$16.7 | \$452.5 |
| **2027** | \$4,939 | 9.3% | \$459.3 | \$452.5 | \$18.1 | \$477.4 |
| **2028** | \$5,013 | 9.6% | \$481.2 | \$477.4 | \$19.1 | \$500.3 |
| **2029** | \$5,063 | 9.8% | \$496.2 | \$500.3 | \$20.0 | \$516.2 |
| **2030** | \$5,114 | 10.0% | \$511.4 | \$516.2 | \$20.6 | \$532.0 |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income stream is treated as the projected Cash Flow for the purpose of this DCF.

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **8.5%** | A reasonable, yet conservative, weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a stable consumer self-care company. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative maturity rate, below long-term global GDP/inflation projections. |

#### A. Net Present Value (NPV) of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (NI) (CFt) (millions) | Discount Factor (1 + r)^t | Present Value (millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=1) | \$418.4 | 1.0850 | \$385.6 |
| **2026** (t=2) | \$452.5 | 1.1772 | \$384.4 |
| **2027** (t=3) | \$477.4 | 1.2773 | \$373.8 |
| **2028** (t=4) | \$500.3 | 1.3858 | \$361.0 |
| **2029** (t=5) | \$516.2 | 1.5037 | \$343.3 |
| **2030** (t=6) | \$532.0 | 1.6315 | \$326.1 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **\$2,174.2** |

#### B. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, based on the 2030 Cash Flow (CF6) and the conservative long-term growth rate ($g$ = 2.0%).

*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{CF_{2030} * (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{\$532.0 * (1 + 0.02)}{0.085 - 0.02}$
*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{\$542.64}{0.065} = \$8,348.3$ million

#### C. Net Present Value of Terminal Value ($NPV_{TV}$)

*   $NPV_{TV} = \frac{TV_{2030}}{(1 + r)^6} = \frac{\$8,348.3}{1.6315} = \$5,117.0$ million

#### D. Total Net Present Value ($NPV_{Total}$)

*   $NPV_{Total} = NPV_{Projected} + NPV_{TV}$
*   $NPV_{Total} = \$2,174.2 \text{ million} + \$5,117.0 \text{ million} = \mathbf{\$7,291.2 \text{ million}}$

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

The fair value of the stock is calculated using the following formula:

$$\text{Fair Value} = \frac{\text{NPV of Total Cash Flows} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Total Cash Flows | \$7,291.2 |
| Total Cash (C0) | \$559.0 |
| Total Debt (D0) | (\$4,100.0) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$3,750.2** |
| Shares Outstanding (in millions) | 137.6 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$27.25** |

---

### V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Calculated)** | **\$27.25** |
| **Current Stock Price** (Approximate Market Price) | **\$22.00** (For context, assuming a recent market price) |

The calculated fair value of **\$27.25** is **higher** than the current market price of approximately \$22.00 (assumed for comparison).

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

My conservative valuation suggests a nearly 24% upside from the current market price. This indicates that **the market is currently assigning a greater risk and/or a lower growth and margin profile to Perrigo than what is implied by management's guidance and the execution of their strategic plan.**

The market's underlying assumptions, compared to my own, likely are:

1.  **Lower Success Rate of Restructuring and Margin Expansion:** The market may be skeptical that Perrigo can achieve and maintain the projected Adjusted Gross Margin of $\approx$40% and Operating Margin of $\approx$15\%. The market may be factoring in continued execution risk with **Project Energize** and the **Supply Chain Reinvention**, assuming the net income margin will fail to reach the projected 10.0% terminal rate.
2.  **Infant Formula Volatility and Competitive Pressure:** The market is likely concerned that the Infant Formula segment, which caused a significant earnings headwind in 2024, will continue to be a drag beyond the projected "full offset in 2025". Perrigo's business is heavily in the store-brand/private label space, and the market may be pricing in continued, intense pricing pressure, resulting in lower long-term organic revenue growth than my conservative 1.0% to 2.0% range.
3.  **High Debt/Leverage:** Despite the refinancing efforts, the company still carries a significant debt load (\$4.1 billion). The market may be applying a higher effective discount rate (WACC) to reflect the financial risk from this leverage, which would drive the calculated NPV and fair value lower.

**My Case for the Fair Value:**

My valuation's upside is justified by strictly adhering to a **conservative application of management's stated goals**. I used the *low end* of the 2025 EPS guidance, a conservative ROIC (4.0%), and a conservative long-term growth rate (2.0%). The projected margin expansion is directly tied to the quantifiable, in-progress initiatives (Project Energize and Supply Chain Reinvention) that have already shown positive results and are expected to mature over the forecast period. The market appears to have over-discounted the risks and failed to fully price in the successful execution of the structural improvements Perrigo is making to transition to a more efficient, higher-margin consumer self-care business. **The fair value of \$27.25 represents the value of Perrigo if it successfully executes its "One Perrigo" and Project Energize strategic plans.**
