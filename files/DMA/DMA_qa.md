## Business Summary

The Destra Multi-Alternative Fund operates by gathering money from investors, which are primarily sophisticated individuals and large institutions, usually located across the United States. The Fund acts as a financial intermediary, pooling this capital to invest in a diverse mix of non-traditional assets such as real estate, private loans, and complex trading strategies that are typically hard for regular investors to access. The core revenue model is based on charging a recurring management fee, calculated as a percentage of the total amount of money they manage (Assets Under Management or AUM), regardless of whether the investments make a profit.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is poor investment performance. If the Fund's complex strategies lose money, investors will quickly pull their capital out, causing the total AUM and thus the Fund's management fee revenue to shrink rapidly. Because this Fund invests in assets that are often difficult to sell quickly (like private credit), a sudden wave of withdrawal requests creates a liquidity mismatch. This could force the Fund to sell assets at steep discounts, which immediately harms remaining investors. Historically, during market crashes (like 2008), many 'alternative' funds failed to protect investor capital as promised, damaging long-term trust. A persistent long-term threat is increased competition from larger institutions offering similar products at much lower management fees, threatening Destra's market share and profitability, along with new regulations that could restrict the types of complex investments the Fund is permitted to hold.

## Company History

The history of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) is best understood through the journey of its founding company, Destra Capital Management, and the specific goals it set out to achieve for investors.

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) from its inception to the present day:

### 1. Inception and Founding Purpose (The Why)

*   **Parent Company Founding (2008):** Destra Capital Management was founded in 2008 with a specific mission: to help investors achieve better wealth outcomes by finding "next generation" investment solutions.
*   **The Problem It Sought to Solve:** The company noticed that many high-quality, specialized investment strategies—often called "alternative" investments—were only available to very large institutional clients.
*   **The Goal:** Destra's goal was to partner with expert, independent investment managers and bring their unique, sophisticated strategies to a broader market of financial advisors and investors.
*   **Fund Inception (2012):** The Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) itself was launched on March 16, 2012, as a way to package many different non-traditional investment approaches into a single, accessible fund.
*   **DMA's Core Goal:** The fund's primary objective is to seek long-term returns that are "non-correlated," meaning they do not move in the same direction as the broad stock and bond markets. This provides a potentially smoother ride for an investor's total portfolio.

### 2. The Business Structure (What it is)

*   **What it Invests In:** DMA is a "multi-alternative" fund, which means it holds a variety of investment strategies outside of typical stocks and bonds, such as real estate, private companies (private equity), certain types of loans (alternative credit), and complex hedging strategies designed to reduce risk.
*   **Its Trading Status:** The fund is structured as a Closed-End Fund (CEF) and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker DMA. This means it issues a fixed number of shares that investors buy and sell among themselves on an exchange, similar to a regular stock.
*   **The Management Team:** Destra Capital Advisors acts as the main advisor, while a specialized firm, Validus Growth Investors, acts as the Sub-Adviser, managing the day-to-day investments with their expertise.

### 3. Headwinds and Problems Faced

*   **The Expense Hurdle:** A significant challenge for the fund has been its relatively high expense ratio—the cost of running the fund, which is paid by investors. This high cost creates a "performance hurdle," meaning the underlying investments must perform exceptionally well just to break even after fees.
*   **The CEF Discount Problem:** As a Closed-End Fund, DMA's market price (what an investor buys or sells the share for) is determined by supply and demand, and it often trades below its Net Asset Value (NAV)—the actual worth of all the fund's underlying assets per share. This "discount" is a common problem for CEFs and means investors may not fully realize the value of the fund's successful investments.
*   **Market Price Volatility:** While the underlying asset value (NAV) has generally shown modest positive returns since inception, the market price has experienced more negative performance, reflecting investor skepticism or a persistent discount on the public exchange.

### 4. Innovative Solutions and Successes

*   **The Proprietary Investment Process:** The fund's sub-advisor has implemented a proprietary strategy called the "Dynamic Alpha process," which is put at the core of the portfolio. This process aims to generate consistent, skill-based returns that contribute significantly to the fund's overall performance.
*   **Term Structure Change (A Strategic Fix):** In October 2023, the fund's management took a dramatic step to address the persistent CEF discount problem by changing the fund's structure from "perpetual" (never-ending) to a **"term fund."**
    *   **How it Works:** This new structure sets a dissolution (closing) date of March 31, 2027, unless certain performance targets are met. The promise of a fixed closing date often helps narrow the discount because investors expect the fund will eventually liquidate, distributing the full Net Asset Value (NAV) to shareholders.
*   **Increased Investor Payouts:** Following improvements in performance and income generation, the fund's Board approved an increase in the monthly distribution (dividend) rate in late 2025, which aims to make the fund more attractive to income-focused investors.

### 5. Tailwinds (Favorable Trends)

*   **Demand for Diversification:** A major positive trend for DMA is the increasing desire among investors for true diversification—investments that do not move in lockstep with the standard 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. The fund's goal of offering non-correlated performance aligns perfectly with this trend.
*   **Experienced Management:** The parent company, Destra Capital, benefits from having long-tenured managers, with an average tenure of ten years, suggesting stability and a deep knowledge base to guide their various strategies through complete market cycles.
*   **Strong Manager Success Rate (Overall):** Destra Capital has a relatively strong track record overall, with about 75% of its various investment strategies having beaten their category peer median over the last three years, which helps attract and retain investors across its product shelf.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) is based less on scale and more on its complex, specialized investment strategy and its unique vehicle for delivering that strategy to a specific investor base.

***

### **Moat and Differentiation**

1.  **Unique Investment Strategy ("The Moat"):** The fund's primary differentiator is its "Multi-Strategy Alternative Approach" (MASS), which is explicitly modeled after the sophisticated endowment investing pioneered by institutions like the Yale Endowment. This strategy is designed to provide returns that are not closely correlated with the overall stock and bond markets.
2.  **Access to Complex Alternatives:** It offers retail investors access to a diversified portfolio of complex, often hard-to-access asset classes, including proprietary hedge strategies, direct private equity, alternative credit, and real estate, mixing both liquid and illiquid positions. For a small investor, replicating this mix independently is difficult and expensive.
3.  **Proprietary Alpha Process:** The fund's Sub-Adviser utilizes an internally developed, differentiated strategy referred to as the "Validex Dynamic Alpha process," which forms the core of the portfolio. This process, built on rigorous research and risk management, represents the firm’s intellectual property—its unique "recipe" for investment success.
4.  **Closed-End Fund (CEF) Structure:** The fund began as a non-listed interval fund and then became a closed-end fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This structure allows the fund to hold illiquid assets like private equity while still offering shareholders a form of daily liquidity through an exchange-traded share, which sets it apart from traditional open-end mutual funds.

### **Pricing Power and Market Position**

5.  **Lack of Pricing Power on the Market:** The fund is relatively small, with Assets Under Management (AUM) around \$78-91 million. More critically, its shares have frequently traded at a "massive discount" to its Net Asset Value (NAV), which shows it lacks strong market power and investor demand. The high discount indicates investors are not willing to pay the full value of the underlying assets, forcing the fund to trade at a "bargain" price, thus nullifying potential pricing power.
6.  **High Internal Fees (The Trade-off):** The fund has a high gross expense ratio (over 4%), which is common for funds that invest in a "fund of funds" style or with multiple complex alternative managers. This high fee structure does give the manager a competitive *internal* pricing advantage (a high cut of the assets), but it also acts as a headwind for the fund's performance and market demand.

### **Growth, Stickiness, and Displacement**

7.  **Reason for Growth:** The growth of the parent company, Destra Capital, since its founding in 2008, was driven by a mission to specifically help **financial professionals** deliver alternative investment strategies to their clients. The fund’s existence is tied to providing a convenient, all-in-one vehicle for advisors who want to incorporate an endowment-like portfolio into their clients' wealth plans.
8.  **Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The revenue is recurring, as it comes from management fees (a percentage of assets) paid daily or monthly as long as the assets remain invested. The fund encourages customer stickiness by offering a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP), which automatically reinvests distributions back into the fund, fostering a long-term, recurring shareholder base.
9.  **Vulnerability to Displacement:** The fund is highly vulnerable to displacement by competitors with more capital. The AUM is small, and larger asset managers can easily launch a similar multi-alternative closed-end fund, potentially with a lower fee structure or a stronger brand name, which would attract investors away from DMA. The primary moat is the proprietary investment strategy itself, which is challenging to replicate, not the fund's size or market position.
10. **Network Effects / Distribution Advantage:** The parent company's original focus on building relationships with **financial professionals** suggests a distribution-side network effect: as more financial advisors use Destra's products and see success, it validates the platform, which attracts more advisors. This network of advisors acts as a solid distribution channel that can be difficult for a new entrant to replicate quickly.
11. **R&D and Constant Innovation:** The company's core edge is in its intellectual property and constant refinement of its investment process. The reliance on "proprietary hedge strategies" and the "Dynamic Alpha process" means the fund must **constantly innovate** and perform rigorous research (the finance equivalent of R&D) to maintain its investment edge and justify its higher fees and complex approach. If the alpha-generating strategies stop working, the entire moat collapses.

## Catalyst Analysis

The analysis of Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) reveals several near-term and long-term catalysts, with management's stated strategy focusing on enhanced performance and income generation.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Increasing Stock Price)

1.  **Increased Distribution Rate:** The fund has recently announced multiple increases to its monthly distribution, including an increase in October 2025. A higher distribution, especially one that is consistently raised, makes the stock more attractive to income investors and can push the market price higher.
2.  **Strong Portfolio Performance and Income Generation:** Management's stated goals for 2025 included "Significant strides in portfolio performance, income and gain generation" and a "repositioning of assets." Continued execution on these goals, particularly successful returns from the fund's alternative asset mix (real estate, private credit, hedging), would boost its Net Asset Value (NAV) and market price.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Increasing Stock Price)

1.  **Potential Closing of the Discount to NAV:** As a closed-end fund, DMA trades at a significant discount (approximately -15%) to its actual asset value (NAV). Any action taken by the fund, such as share repurchases or a tender offer, would help reduce this discount and directly increase the share price.
2.  **Fixed-Term Dissolution Date:** The fund's structure was changed in October 2023 to include a term limit, meaning it is scheduled to dissolve on March 31, 2027, unless extended. This is a powerful catalyst for closed-end funds, as the market expects the fund's price to converge with its Net Asset Value (NAV) as the dissolution date approaches.
3.  **Alpha Strategy Execution:** Management (Sub-Advisor Validex Global Investing) emphasizes the role of their proprietary "Validex Dynamic Alpha process" as a central and growing contributor to fund performance. Consistent outperformance driven by this core strategy provides a long-term reason for investors to value the fund higher.

### Management's Stated Strategy (from Recent Releases)

*   Management's primary objective for 2025 was to achieve "Significant strides in portfolio performance, income and gain generation, transparency in holdings and repositioning of assets."
*   They explicitly stated that their proprietary "Validex Dynamic Alpha process" is at the "center of the Fund's portfolio," with other exposures like alternative credit, real estate, and private equity satellited around it as diversifiers and sources of non-correlated returns.
*   The recent distribution increase was directly attributed to the "great work that Validex is doing with the Fund’s portfolio."

## Management Record

The management analysis of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) focuses on the Investment Adviser, Destra Capital Advisors LLC, and the Investment Sub-Adviser, Validus Growth Investors LLC (dba Validex Global Investing).

### Management and Track Record

1.  **Fund Management Structure:** Destra Capital Advisors LLC serves as the Investment Adviser to the fund, with Validus Growth Investors LLC (Validex Global Investing) acting as the Investment Sub-Adviser responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management. The portfolio is managed by Mark C. Scalzo (Portfolio Manager and CIO of Validex) and Zach Leeds (Portfolio Manager).
2.  **Executive Leadership Background:** Destra Capital’s CEO, Dominic Martellaro, is a co-chairman and former Janus executive, with Destra Capital itself founded in 2008 to source alternative investment solutions. The Fund's President, Robert A. Watson, CFP®, is also a Partner and Head of Investments at Destra Capital.
3.  **Historical Performance Context:** The fund, which launched publicly in early 2022 (though with a longer non-listed history since 2012), quickly traded at a massive discount, and historically had not produced substantial returns. This underperformance and lack of market popularity meant the fund was considered one of the closed-end funds with the largest discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV).
4.  **Recent Performance and Value Delivery:** Management, through its sub-adviser Validex, has recently shown a focus on improving performance, citing "significant strides in portfolio performance, income and gain generation." This positive momentum led to an announced increase in the monthly distribution rate for shareholders in October 2025.

### Key Decisions and Strategic Vision

5.  **Key Structural Change (Previous Management Influence):** In a major decision in October 2023, the Board of Trustees approved a change from a perpetual fund structure to a term fund. This decision was influenced by activist investor Saba Capital Management, which had taken a significant position, pressuring the management to realize the massive discount for shareholders.
6.  **Future Strategy and Dissolution Date:** The new term structure provides that the fund will dissolve on March 31, 2027, unless certain performance or trading targets are met to justify an extension. This decision gives shareholders a clear path for the discount to be realized through liquidation.
7.  **Investment Strategy and Vision:** The Sub-Adviser, Validex, has centered its portfolio around its proprietary "Dynamic Alpha process," with satellite allocations to alternative credit, real estate, and private equity. Their stated goals for 2025 included repositioning assets, improving transparency, and continuing to generate income and gains.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA)'s regulatory disclosures, the management's incentives present a mixed structure of fixed fees and performance-contingent survival, with limited direct personal alignment through equity ownership.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership (Low Personal Alignment for Individuals):**
    *   While high-level filings indicate that approximately 25.21% of the Fund's stock is held by "insiders," this figure is heavily influenced by large institutional shareholders like Saba Capital Management, L.P.
    *   The typical disclosure for closed-end funds suggests that the officers and trustees (the Fund's immediate leadership) may own **less than 1%** of the outstanding shares in the aggregate, indicating a relatively low amount of personal capital at risk compared to the fund's total value.
    *   **Conclusion:** The direct financial alignment from personal stock ownership by the Fund's individual managers and directors appears to be low.

2.  **Compensation Structure (Asset-Based Fixed Fee):**
    *   The Investment Adviser, Destra Capital Advisors LLC, is compensated primarily through a fixed **Asset Under Management (AUM) fee**, calculated at an annual rate of **1.35% of the Fund's average daily net assets**, payable monthly.
    *   This AUM fee structure incentivizes the management company to focus on **growing or maintaining the total size of the fund's assets** (AUM), as their revenue is directly tied to this metric rather than outperforming a benchmark or maximizing the fund's NAV (Net Asset Value) performance.

3.  **Overarching Incentive to Act in Shareholders' Interest (Fund Survival):**
    *   A significant alignment mechanism is the Fund's **term structure**, which dictates that the Fund is scheduled to dissolve on March 31, 2027, unless the Board approves an extension based on **meeting certain performance or trading targets**.
    *   This makes the continuation of the advisory contract (and the associated AUM fee revenue stream) **contingent on performance** that satisfies the board and shareholders, creating a critical incentive to deliver results and trade at favorable metrics.
    *   **Conclusion:** While the compensation is based on fixed AUM fees, the *survival* of the Fund and the continuation of the revenue stream for the Adviser are directly tied to achieving shareholder-aligned performance targets (e.g., strong distributions and market price/NAV).

## Price History

The Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) is a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a diversified mix of alternative asset classes, including real estate and alternative credit. Its price movement can be analyzed using standard technical metrics and CEF-specific metrics like the discount to Net Asset Value (NAV).

### **Price History and Technical Analysis**

1.  **Current Position Relative to Range:** Based on a recent closing price of approximately $8.70 and a 52-week range of $7.17 to $9.16, the stock is trading closer to its yearly high than its low.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The fund is currently trading approximately **21.34%** above its 52-week low of $7.17 (using a recent price of $8.70).

3.  **"Trading Low" Technical Analysis (Discount to NAV):** For a closed-end fund, a key metric is the discount or premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV), which represents the market price relative to the value of its underlying assets. The fund is currently trading at a significant **discount of over 15%** to its NAV of $10.31, which technically means you are buying the underlying assets for less than their calculated value.

4.  **Relative Discount/Premium Trend:** While the current discount is substantial at $\approx-15\%$, this is considerably *narrower* than its 3-year average discount of $\approx-32.55\%$. The narrowing of the discount indicates that the market price has moved up faster than the value of the underlying assets, suggesting the stock may be trading higher relative to its historical valuation.

### **Reasons for Recent Price Movement**

1.  **Distribution/Dividend Increases:** The fund has had multiple, recent announcements of distribution increases, a significant positive catalyst for closed-end funds. In May and October 2025, the fund announced increases in its distribution rate, which helps drive up demand and price for an income-focused fund.

2.  **Improved Portfolio Performance:** The announced distribution increases were attributed to "Significant strides in portfolio performance, income and gain generation, transparency in holdings and repositioning of assets" by the fund's management. This positive fundamental news helps justify a higher market price for the shares.

3.  **Positive Momentum from Strategy:** Management specifically noted the success of their "proprietary Validex Dynamic Alpha process" as a "significant and growing contributor to fund performance," which would also contribute to the positive momentum and price appreciation.

## Long Thesis

The Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) is positioned to deliver significant returns to investors primarily because of a strategic fix to its structure, combined with strong recent performance. In the near term, the fund is successfully generating increased income and has repeatedly raised its monthly shareholder payouts, attracting income-focused investors and driving the market price higher. The team's proprietary 'Dynamic Alpha process' is performing well, increasing the actual value of the underlying assets (NAV). The biggest long-term upside lies in the fund's new commitment to a fixed dissolution date of March 31, 2027. This structural change acts as a powerful lever, guaranteeing that the fund's market price, which currently trades at a significant discount, will likely converge with the true asset value (NAV) as that date approaches. This means investors are buying the underlying assets at a bargain price today, expecting to realize the full asset value within the next few years. This, coupled with the fund's unique ability to offer complex, non-correlated investments that are highly demanded for diversification, makes DMA a strong vehicle for both high income and significant capital appreciation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on four key outcomes: 1) Management must continue to successfully execute its complex, proprietary 'Dynamic Alpha process' to generate consistent investment returns that justify the fund's high operating fees. 2) The underlying illiquid assets (like real estate and private credit) must maintain their current valuation or appreciate leading up to the dissolution date. 3) The management must adhere to the 2027 term structure, allowing the market price to converge with the Net Asset Value (NAV) so shareholders can realize the full value of the fund's assets. 4) The fund must continue to raise or maintain its increased distributions to keep attracting necessary investor demand.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

## Bear Case Critique of the Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA) Long Thesis

The bullish thesis for DMA is vulnerable on several critical assumptions regarding management's ability to create value, the true sustainability of the yield, and the certainty of the fund's term structure. The bear case faults the thesis on the following points:

1.  **Risk of Term Structure Extension and Discount Realization:** The thesis's "guarantee" of a price-to-NAV convergence by the March 31, 2027, dissolution date is not absolute. The fund's term structure allows for the Board of Trustees to approve an extension of up to twelve months at their "sole discretion" if certain performance targets are not met. Furthermore, the term can be extended for additional three-year terms if performance or trading targets (like trading near NAV or meeting a cumulative return threshold) *are* met. This uncertainty significantly undermines the principal investment thesis of a **guaranteed** future liquidation at NAV, which could push the convergence horizon years into the future.
2.  **Excessive Expense Ratio Eroding Returns:** The high expense ratio, reported between $\text{3.69\%}$ and $\text{4.44\%}$, is an enormous hurdle for the fund's proprietary "Dynamic Alpha process" to overcome. Even if the management's strategy generates positive returns, these returns are heavily diminished by the excessive fees, challenging the assumption that management can generate "consistent investment returns that justify the fund's high operating fees."
3.  **Significant and Persistent NAV Erosion:** The claim that the "Dynamic Alpha process" is performing well and "increasing the actual value of the underlying assets (NAV)" is contradicted by the fund's history. The inception NAV in January 2022 was \$12.00, but the last reported NAV as of October 2025 was \$10.25, representing a significant capital erosion of over $\text{14\%}$ since its public listing. This indicates a consistent inability to protect or grow shareholder capital after fees over the long term.
4.  **Unsustainable Distribution Policy (Return of Capital Risk):** The high distribution yield, which has been recently raised, is likely unsustainable solely from net investment income (NII). The fund's own announcements mention that a portion of the distribution may be paid from sources *other than* net investment income, including short-term capital, which carries a risk of the distribution being a destructive "return of capital". This practice pays investors back their own principal and further contributes to the NAV erosion, contradicting the assumption that high distributions will "keep attracting necessary investor demand" without depleting the fund's core value.
5.  **Illiquid Assets and Forced Liquidation Risk:** The fund holds a substantial portion of illiquid assets, such as real estate, private equity, and alternative credit. If the fund does proceed with the 2027 dissolution, a forced sale of these illiquid holdings to meet the liquidation mandate could result in sales at depressed prices, leading to a final distribution value significantly *below* the reported NAV. This directly challenges the assumption that "underlying illiquid assets... must maintain their current valuation or appreciate" because their **liquidation value** may be far lower than their calculated mark-to-model NAV.
6.  **High Discount Normalization:** While the current discount to NAV is high (around $\text{15\%}$), it represents a **significant narrowing** from the fund's historical average 3-year discount of -32.55%. This indicates that a large part of the "discount capture" opportunity has already been realized by the market since the term structure change announcement, limiting the potential capital appreciation from further convergence.

## Next Steps

The existing analysis provides a strong foundation for the bull and bear cases, especially around the structural change (2027 dissolution date) and the risk of the high expense ratio.

However, the core debate hinges on quantifiable financial details that are still missing. Your next steps should focus on obtaining specific data from regulatory filings (SEC reports) to validate or invalidate the critical assumptions in the long and bear theses.

Here are the most important questions you should investigate next:

### **1. Financial Quality and Distribution Sustainability (Bear Case 4)**

*   **Determine the True Source of the Yield (NII vs. ROC):** Find the most recent **Section 19(a) Notice, Annual Report, or Semi-Annual Report** for DMA. Quantify the percentage breakdown of the distribution (the "yield") between **Net Investment Income (NII)**, **Short-Term Capital Gains**, and potentially **Return of Capital (ROC)**. If a significant portion is ROC, the bear case is strengthened, as the fund is paying investors their own principal back.

### **2. Proprietary Strategy and Liquidity (Moat & Bear Case 5)**

*   **Analyze the Portfolio's True Liquidity Mix:** Use the most recent SEC filings (e.g., N-CSR, shareholder report) to find the current percentage allocation between the highly liquid, actively managed "Dynamic Alpha" strategies and the illiquid assets (Real Estate, Direct Private Equity, Alternative Credit). This is essential for:
    *   Assessing the risk of forced selling/liquidation at a discount in 2027.
    *   Validating the management's claim that they are shifting the portfolio into more liquid strategies.
*   **Deconstruct the "Validex Dynamic Alpha" Process:** Search for any white papers, conference presentations, or third-party reports that detail the actual mechanics (e.g., long/short equities, managed futures, arbitrage) and historical risk-adjusted performance of the proprietary "Validex Dynamic Alpha process" to confirm its viability as a long-term moat.

### **3. Structural Risk and Activist Influence (Bull/Bear Case 1)**

*   **Confirm Activist Investor Status:** Search for recent news or SEC filings (13F or 13D) related to **Saba Capital Management** and the **Destra Multi-Alternative Fund (DMA)**. Determine Saba's current percentage ownership and whether they have made any recent public statements or filed new shareholder proposals. An active Saba increases the pressure to liquidate at the 2027 term date.
*   **Investigate the Term Extension Provisions:** Find the exact language in the fund's governing documents (the latest prospectus or proxy statement) detailing the specific "performance or trading targets" that must be met for the Board to approve an extension beyond March 31, 2027. This will quantify the risk of the term being extended.

### **4. Competitive Benchmarking (Business Risk)**

*   **Compare to Peer Group:** Identify a small group of direct competitors—other multi-alternative closed-end funds (CEFs) that use similar endowment-like strategies (e.g., ticker symbols like **DNP, KYN, or similar multi-strategy CEFs**). Compare DMA's:
    *   **Total Expense Ratio (4.08% as of 3/31/2025)** to the category average.
    *   **Cumulative 3-Year Total NAV Return** against this peer group to judge the true effectiveness of the "Dynamic Alpha" moat *after* fees.
    *   **Current Discount to NAV** against the peer group to gauge if the $\approx -15\%$ discount is abnormally large or just typical for the category.
