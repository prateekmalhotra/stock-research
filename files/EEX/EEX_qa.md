## Business Summary

Emerald Holding, Inc. primarily operates as an organizer of large, business-to-business (B2B) trade shows, conferences, and events across the United States. The company's core business model is centered on creating temporary marketplaces where exhibitors (companies looking to sell products or services, often located domestically) rent floor space (booths) to showcase their offerings to targeted industry buyers and professionals (attendees). Revenue is generated mostly by selling this physical exhibition space and charging attendance fees for specialized conferences. Their customer base is diverse, covering industries such as jewelry, construction, retail, and design, meaning they monetize specific industry communities by facilitating face-to-face transactions and networking.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for Emerald Holding is its inherent reliance on large physical gatherings and domestic business travel. Any severe economic downturn forces businesses to immediately cut discretionary marketing and travel budgets, directly resulting in fewer rented booths and fewer attendees. A critical long-term risk is the potential for technological obsolescence, where sophisticated digital tools and virtual platforms might eventually offer a cheaper and equally effective way for buyers and sellers to connect, reducing the perceived value of high-cost, time-consuming physical trade shows. This kind of threat became acute during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the cancellation of nearly all events, demonstrating the model's high vulnerability to health crises or government mandates prohibiting large gatherings. Although events have resumed, volatility related to future travel restrictions or localized safety concerns, combined with the ongoing need to prove the superior return on investment of physical events over digital alternatives, remains a constant cause for concern regarding earnings and market position.

## Company History

Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) is a major U.S.-based company that specializes in creating business-to-business (B2B) marketplaces, primarily through large-scale trade shows, but also through digital platforms and media.

Here is a history lesson on Emerald Holding, Inc., from its inception to the present day.

### **Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  The company known today as Emerald Holding, Inc. was essentially formed in **2013** when the private equity firm Onex Corporation acquired a group of trade shows called **Nielsen Expositions**.
2.  The initial company was rebranded as **Emerald Expositions**, with the goal of creating a standalone, focused entity dedicated to the business of running trade shows and B2B media in the United States.
3.  The core purpose of the business was, and remains, to **connect buyers and sellers** across different industries by building dynamic platforms, primarily live events, that drive commerce and create value for its customers.
4.  Soon after its founding in 2014, Emerald significantly expanded its portfolio by acquiring **George Little Management (GLM)**, which added major events like the NY NOW gift show, solidifying its position in the trade show market.

### **Growth and The Public Market**

5.  Emerald Expositions held its **Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2017**, which means it began trading its shares on the New York Stock Exchange to raise capital for further growth and increase its visibility in the public financial markets.
6.  For many years, the company operated primarily on a successful model that benefited from a "network effect"—the more high-quality buyers and sellers attended their shows, the more valuable those events became, leading to predictable and recurring revenue.

### **Headwinds and The Pandemic Crisis**

7.  The single biggest headwind the company has ever faced was the **COVID-19 pandemic**, starting in 2020, which forced the widespread cancellation or postponement of nearly all in-person events, shattering their primary business model overnight.
8.  This challenge was severe because their revenue model relied on holding successful live events; without them, the company had to quickly adapt to survive an economic environment of uncertainty.

### **Innovative Solutions and Digital Transformation**

9.  In response to the pandemic, Emerald rapidly accelerated a **"digital pivot"** to move beyond being just a live event organizer, which was a critical, innovative solution to overcome the crisis.
10. This new strategy involved expanding their offerings to create a **365-day engagement model** by providing solutions that connect buyers and sellers digitally all year round, not just during an annual or biannual trade show.
11. A key move in this digital transformation was the **acquisition of PlumRiver LLC (Elastic Suite) in 2021**, a company that provides B2B e-commerce and digital catalog tools for manufacturers and retailers.
12. To reflect this broader business strategy of integrating live events with digital and e-commerce solutions, the company officially **rebranded from Emerald Expositions to Emerald Holding, Inc.**

### **Present Day and Future Goals (Tailwinds)**

13. Today, Emerald is a leader in building **dynamic, market-driven platforms** that integrate live events with digital tools, content, and e-commerce solutions, aiming to be a true partner for businesses.
14. The biggest tailwind the company has been fortunate to experience is the **return of in-person events** following the pandemic, as their core business sees a positive trajectory from the ongoing recovery of face-to-face gatherings.
15. Their growth strategy now focuses on **strategic acquisitions** to diversify their business into high-growth areas, such as purchasing companies that specialize in executive-level summits, luxury travel events, and insurance technology conferences.
16. In essence, the company's ultimate goal is to move from being an event producer to being a comprehensive platform that drives commerce through a mix of **live connection, influential content, and powerful commerce solutions** for its diverse customer base, many of whom are small and medium-sized businesses.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) is not built on a unique product or a technology edge, but rather on **sticky, high-value business relationships** and the powerful, self-reinforcing dynamics of its leading trade shows.

Here is an analysis of its competitive advantages:

### 1. Market Position and Differentiation

*   **Focus on Market-Leading Events:** Emerald Holding is a leading operator of business-to-business (B2B) trade shows in the United States. Its key advantage is that many of its events are the "preeminent event," meaning they are the most important gathering in their specific industry, such as retail, manufacturing, or healthcare.
*   **The "One-Stop Shop" Advantage:** The company's business model has expanded beyond just live events to include digital media, e-commerce, and content. This "connections, content, and commerce" approach offers exhibitors and attendees year-round engagement, not just a few days at a trade show.
*   **Differentiation from Global Giants:** While its main competitors like Informa Markets and Reed Exhibitions are massive global event organizers, Emerald's differentiation lies in its established, specialized portfolio within key U.S. industry verticals.

### 2. Pricing Power and Special Position

*   **Implied Pricing Power:** The company holds a special position because its flagship shows are essential marketplaces where buyers and sellers from a specific industry must be present to stay relevant. This market-leading position and the consistent, high-quality attendance give it a degree of pricing power over booth rental space and sponsorships.
*   **Established Brand Value:** Its trade show franchises often have significant brand value established over long periods, with some event histories spanning over 20 years. This longevity and reputation act as a barrier to entry, as a newcomer cannot simply create an equally respected event overnight.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

*   **The Network Effect:** The core of the company's moat is a "self-reinforcing network effect." The value for exhibitors increases as more qualified buyers (attendees) show up, and the value for attendees increases as more high-quality exhibitors participate.
*   **Recurring Contracts/Loyalty:** This strong network effect and exceptional value proposition for participants lead to high loyalty and predictable, **recurring revenue streams**. Most B2B exhibitors plan to return to the key shows annually, making the revenue model relatively sticky.
*   **High Switching Costs:** Exhibitors and attendees face high "switching costs" (in terms of time, effort, and lost connections) if they choose to leave an industry's preeminent show for a lesser alternative. They risk losing access to their most important customers, suppliers, and industry trends.

### 4. Displacement Risk and Historical Growth

*   **Growth by Acquisition and History:** Emerald grew into what it is today primarily through strategic acquisitions of well-established, market-leading trade shows. This strategy allowed it to quickly consolidate fragmented markets and build a diverse portfolio of must-attend events.
*   **Difficulty of Displacement by Capital:** It is **difficult, though not impossible,** to displace Emerald with just more capital. A competitor with more money could launch a competing show, but it would take significant time and investment—likely many years—to build the necessary long-standing relationships, brand prestige, and critical mass of loyal, high-quality participants that Emerald's top shows possess.
*   **Primary Risk:** A significant risk for the company is that its top five trade shows generate a large portion of its total revenue, making it vulnerable if one of those cornerstone events faces disruption or a sudden drop in participation.

### 5. Innovation and Future Moat Reinforcement

*   **Investment in Digital (Not R&D in a traditional sense):** While the company is not a tech firm and does not invest heavily in R&D in the way a software or pharmaceutical company does, it must constantly innovate to maintain its edge.
*   **Current Strategy to Solidify the Moat:** Emerald is making substantial investments in digital transformation and has appointed a Chief Digital Officer. The goal is to integrate AI, enhance its digital platforms, and provide better tools for exhibitors and attendees to measure their return-on-investment (ROI).
*   **Maintaining the Edge:** This innovation is crucial because it ensures the company's offering remains competitive against digital-only alternatives and provides year-round value that strengthens the core moat of the in-person event, making it even harder to replace.

## Catalyst Analysis

Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) catalysts are centered on its post-pandemic recovery of the live events business, strategic acquisitions, and portfolio optimization efforts.

### Near-Term Catalysts (0-12 Months)

1.  **Sustained Live Event and Organic Growth:** The core business, B2B trade shows and events, continues its post-pandemic recovery, providing operating leverage and strong organic revenue growth. Management's strategy is to leverage the fixed cost of running events to increase Adjusted EBITDA and work toward pre-COVID margins.
2.  **Strategic Acquisitions and Portfolio Expansion:** Recently completed acquisitions, such as Generis Group and InsureTech Insights, immediately boost revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by adding high-growth, executive-level summits to the portfolio. Management highlights these acquisitions as a way to expand into high-growth experiential events and strengthen the company's market position.
3.  **Achieving and Raising Guidance:** Management is explicitly guiding for and remains on track to deliver full-year 2025 revenue of $\$450-\$460$ million and Adjusted EBITDA of $\$120-\$125$ million. Meeting or raising this guidance would likely serve as a catalyst for the stock price.
4.  **Free Cash Flow and Capital Return:** The company has demonstrated improved free cash flow generation, a direct result of higher Adjusted EBITDA. This strong cash flow supports the payment of a quarterly dividend and provides capital for strategic investments or potential future share repurchases, which can support the stock price.

### Long-Term Catalysts (1+ Years)

1.  **Digital Transformation and 365-Day Platform:** Management is implementing a strategy of digital transformation, including appointing a Chief Digital Officer, to integrate live events with digital tools and data-focused solutions. This aims to create year-round commerce opportunities, rather than just event-day revenue, which is a key component of the long-term strategy.
2.  **Targeted Portfolio Optimization:** The company is strategically pruning non-core or discontinued events to focus its resources and efforts on high-growth sectors like luxury and technology, which are expected to drive more profitable long-term growth.
3.  **Margin Expansion Potential:** The ultimate goal for management is to return to pre-pandemic Adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% or more over time. As the business continues to scale and leverage its fixed investments, achieving this higher margin would indicate sustained operational efficiency and profitability.
4.  **Global Network Expansion:** Emerald is expanding its global sales agent network and utilizing opportunities in emerging markets like Turkey, Brazil, and the UAE to drive growth. This geographic and network expansion diversifies the business and creates new growth opportunities in international markets.

## Management Record

An analysis of the management of Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) for an investor:

### Current Management: Hervé Sedky (CEO) and Executive Team

1.  **CEO Background and Expertise:** Hervé Sedky was appointed President and CEO, effective January 2021. He brought significant industry and executive experience, including six years as President of Reed Exhibitions Americas and a 20-year executive career at American Express, which is highly relevant to the B2B events and travel markets.
2.  **Management Tenure and Experience:** The current management team is considered experienced, with an average tenure of 4.5 years, while the Board of Directors has an average tenure of 7.4 years.
3.  **CEO Compensation and Alignment:** The CEO’s total compensation is below average for companies of similar size in the US market, and is reported to be consistent with the company’s performance over the past year. Performance-based stock awards for the CEO and CFO are explicitly tied to achieving specified targeted share prices, aiming to align executive incentives with shareholder value.

### Management Performance and Track Record

4.  **Delivering on Strategic Promises (M&A and Digital):** Since Sedky's appointment, the company has executed a strategy centered on **M&A** to build a diversified portfolio and accelerated its **digital transformation**. Key acquisitions include MJBiz and Generis Group, and new roles like Chief Digital Officer have been created to lead the integration of digital tools and AI.
5.  **Portfolio Optimization (Tough Decisions):** Management is accelerating a "portfolio optimization" plan, which involves the difficult decision to discontinue approximately 20 underperforming events that collectively generated roughly $20 million in annual revenues. The CEO adopted a more serious, "down-to-business attitude" in a Q3 2024 earnings call, acknowledging the need for these cuts to position the company for sustained future growth.
6.  **Financial Results and Volatility:** While the company reported a disappointing net loss in Q3 2024, leading to a temporary stock drop, full-year 2024 results showed a significant improvement to a net income of \$2.2 million, up from a net loss in 2023. The stock has shown strong recent momentum, surging over 30% in the six months leading up to September 2025.

### Shareholder Value and Capital Allocation

7.  **Shareholder Returns:** Management has actively returned capital, including a stock repurchase of \$8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the declaration of a quarterly dividend of \$0.015 per share in early 2025.
8.  **Financial Flexibility:** A key financial decision in early 2025 was the successful refinancing and up-sizing of its term loan, which strengthens financial flexibility and provides greater capacity to fund strategic growth and acquisitions.
9.  **Stock Performance Context:** The company's stock has an overall rocky history (an 85% decline in the five years leading up to early 2022, covering the pre-Sedky/pandemic period), but analysts currently have a consensus "Buy" rating with a median target price significantly above the current price, indicating confidence in the forward strategy.

### Future Strategy and Vision

10. **Vision and Strategy:** Emerald's vision is to build dynamic, market-driven platforms that integrate live events with a broad array of industry insights, digital tools, and data-focused solutions.
11. **Core Growth Pillars:** The future strategy is focused on integrating acquisitions, leveraging digital capabilities, and expanding the Event Tech platforms to create a cohesive, year-round journey for B2B communities and drive measurable results for customers.

### Previous Management Change

12. **Reason for CEO Change:** The current CEO was appointed after the former CEO, Sally Shankland, resigned in January 2020 due to a battle with cancer; Brian Field served as the interim President and CEO for approximately a year before Sedky's appointment.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Emerald Holding, Inc.'s (EEX) management incentive and compensation structure is as follows:

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

1.  **Insider and Control Ownership is Extremely High:** Emerald Holding is controlled by Onex Private Equity Holdings LLC, which is classified as an insider and holds approximately **90.5%** of the company's common stock on an as-converted basis. This level of control means the company's strategic direction and executive appointments are aligned with the private equity firm's interest in maximizing its own investment return.

2.  **Individual Manager Ownership is Substantial but not Dominant:** The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Hervé Sedky, directly owns a smaller but still significant 0.28% of the company's shares. This individual stake ensures the top executive has "skin in the game" tied to the public share price, though his ownership is dwarfed by the controlling shareholder.

3.  **Total Executive Compensation is Moderate for Market Size:** The CEO's total yearly compensation of approximately **$1.13 million** in the most recent reported year is noted as below the average compensation for CEOs of companies of a similar size in the U.S. market. This suggests the company is not paying excessively high fixed salaries.

4.  **Compensation Structure Emphasizes Performance:** A significant portion of the CEO's compensation is variable, with the annual bonus component accounting for a substantial part of his cash pay. This structure links a large portion of the executive's total compensation to annual performance.

5.  **Incentive Metrics are Tied to Financial Results:** Executive incentive pay is linked to the company's financial performance, with the company specifically reporting a focus on key metrics like **Revenue** and **Adjusted EBITDA** growth. Furthermore, the CEO's compensation has been reported as "consistent with company performance," indicating an operational tie-in.

### Conclusion on Incentive Alignment

*   **Management Has Enough Incentive to Act in the Interest of Shareholders:** **Yes**, the management's incentives are overwhelmingly aligned with the interests of its largest shareholder, Onex. Since Onex's entire investment return depends on the long-term appreciation of its massive equity stake, the primary goal is creating **shareholder value**.
*   **Mitigation of Self-Enrichment Risk:** The compensation structure and amount appear reasonable for the market, and a large portion of the pay is variable and based on company performance. The company is effectively run to maximize value for the 90.5% controlling shareholder, which benefits all public shareholders through share price appreciation.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** The highly concentrated ownership by a major financial entity creates a powerful alignment, and the executive compensation structure reinforces this by keeping pay reasonable and tied to financial metrics focused on growing the core business.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) stock data, here is an analysis of its price history and technical standing:

1.  **52-Week Low Calculation:** The stock is currently trading significantly above its 52-week low. With a recent price around \$5.12 and a 52-week low of approximately \$3.22, the stock is currently **~59%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The current price of EEX is closer to its 52-week high of \$5.45 than its low, indicating a strong move up over the last year. This positioning suggests the stock has experienced substantial recovery or growth over the measurement period.

3.  **Technical Analysis Signal (Trading Low?):** Contrary to trading low, technical analysis indicators on platforms like TradingView generally suggest a bullish or "buy" trend. The combined technical rating for EEX indicates a prevailing "buy" signal on both the 1-week and 1-month time frames.

4.  **Recent Stock Gains Explained (Q2 2025):** A significant uplift in the stock price can be attributed to its strong second-quarter 2025 financial results. Emerald Holding reported that its Q2 loss had narrowed, and its revenue jumped by 23%, a positive surprise that saw the stock rise in pre-market trading.

5.  **Strategic Growth Driving Momentum:** The company has also demonstrated a focus on strategic growth, which often fuels investor optimism. In August 2025, Emerald announced the acquisition of **Generis Group**, a move intended to accelerate growth in executive-level summits.

## Long Thesis

This company is making a major comeback because businesses truly need face-to-face meetings and physical trade shows again. Emerald runs the essential, market-leading events in many US industries, giving it powerful pricing leverage. In the near term, strong recovery in attendance and strategic acquisitions of high-growth technology and executive summits will immediately boost cash flow and profit. The management team is focused on efficiency, cutting poorly performing events while simultaneously working toward returning operating margins to very high pre-pandemic levels. The biggest long-term growth driver is transforming the business into a comprehensive, year-round digital marketplace. This strategy means Emerald can offer continuous connections and commerce solutions, not just annual events, making the business much more resilient, profitable, and less vulnerable to future economic shocks or health crises.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that large, in-person B2B trade shows will remain the essential, primary marketplace for their respective industries and that digital tools will only supplement, not replace, these gatherings. This thesis also assumes stable economic conditions in the U.S. that encourage corporate spending on marketing, travel, and exhibition space. Finally, management must successfully execute its complex plan to integrate new acquisitions and develop a functional, revenue-generating digital platform that provides year-round value, thereby achieving the targeted long-term margin expansion.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This is a strong, multi-faceted bull case, but its foundation rests on several optimistic assumptions that are challenged by recent financial performance and macro-industry trends. The bear case thesis identifies flaws primarily in the company's financial structure, the true *organic* health of the core business, and the high-risk, complex execution of its long-term digital strategy.

## Bear Case Thesis & Critique of Flaws

The long thesis for Emerald Holding, Inc. (EEX) suffers from four primary flaws: a misleading "recovery" narrative, a crippling debt burden that consumes most operating profit, structural margin pressure, and significant execution risk on its unproven digital growth strategy.

### 1. High Financial Leverage and Debt Servicing Risk

*   **Crippling Interest Expense:** The claim of an "immediate boost to cash flow and profit" is directly countered by a heavy debt load. Total long-term debt and capital lease obligations stand at over $500 million, and the company’s total interest expense was **$47.8 million** for 2024, an almost doubling from 2022 levels. This high cost of debt service consumes a massive portion of operating income, leaving minimal net income and severely limiting free cash flow available for organic reinvestment or shareholder returns.
*   **Precarious Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio:** With an annualized Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of **6.75** as of Q2 2025, the company is highly leveraged, indicating a stretched financial position that is vulnerable to a recession or further interest rate increases. This leverage is far above the "scary" threshold of four generally used by investors.
*   **Significant Dilution Risk:** The capital structure includes convertible preferred shares that represent a massive potential dilution to common shareholders. Full conversion would nearly triple the common share count, potentially significantly depressing Earnings Per Share (EPS) and common stock value.

### 2. Weak Organic Core Business Growth

*   **Muted Organic Revenue Growth:** The "strong recovery" narrative is primarily acquisition-driven. Q2 2025 organic revenue growth was a very modest **0.4%** year-over-year (though pro-forma growth for recent acquisitions was higher), indicating that the core portfolio of "essential, market-leading events" is experiencing sluggish attendance and/or pricing power is not as robust as claimed.
*   **Challenged Margin Recovery:** The goal of returning operating margins to "very high pre-pandemic levels" is difficult to achieve; the TTM Gross Margin as of mid-2025 was **63.36%**, noticeably lower than the pre-pandemic range of 67% to 73%. Increased operating costs and venue expenses appear to be structurally depressing profitability compared to historical levels.

### 3. High-Risk, Unproven Digital Transformation

*   **Minimal Digital Revenue Contribution:** The core long-term growth driver—transforming the business into a "comprehensive, year-round digital marketplace"—has not yet demonstrated meaningful scale or profitability. The "Commerce" and "Content" revenue streams that form the digital/year-round offering have only shown marginal organic growth, indicating that the complex plan for a resilient digital platform is struggling in its execution or adoption.
*   **Execution Risk of "Complex Plan":** Building a revenue-generating, year-round "digital marketplace" is a complex, capital-intensive technology build-out that shifts the company into a new, highly competitive B2B software/e-commerce space. The reliance on this "complex plan" to generate long-term margin expansion represents a major execution risk that could drain capital without producing the promised "resilient" revenue stream.

### 4. Cyclical and Structural Industry Headwinds

*   **Vulnerability to Economic Shocks:** The core assumption of "stable economic conditions" is a major fault. The trade show industry is highly cyclical, as corporate marketing and travel budgets are often the first to be cut during a U.S. economic downturn, making the business extremely vulnerable to future recessions.
*   **The Hybrid Event Challenge:** The assumption that "digital tools will only supplement, not replace" in-person events is a structural risk. The rise of sophisticated virtual and hybrid B2B event models offers exhibitors a lower-cost, broader-reach alternative, which could cap the pricing power and attendance growth of purely physical trade shows over the long term.

---

## Next Steps

1.  **Quantify Digital Transformation Success (Commerce Segment Revenue)**
    *   **The Problem:** The bear case critiques the "unproven digital growth strategy," and the Q2 2025 report mentions "softness in content" but provides no specific revenue or organic growth figures for the crucial **Commerce segment (Elastic Suite)**.
    *   **Next Step:** Search for the specific revenue contribution, revenue growth rate, and margin of the *Commerce* segment from the most recent quarterly or annual report. This will determine if the "365-day platform" is an effective long-term growth driver or merely a minor offset to cyclical live event revenue.

2.  **Analyze and Quantify Convertible Preferred Stock Dilution Risk**
    *   **The Problem:** The bear case claims "Significant Dilution Risk" because Onex controls 90.5% of the common stock *on an as-converted basis*, implying a massive potential tripling of common shares. The actual conversion terms are missing.
    *   **Next Step:** Search for the terms, conversion price, and total number of preferred shares (or their value) related to the convertible preferred stock to accurately calculate the *potential* dilution impact on the common share count and Earnings Per Share (EPS).

3.  **Evaluate True Impact of Interest Expense on Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
    *   **The Problem:** The bear case is based on a high 2024 annual interest expense of $\$47.8$ million, but the Net Debt/EBITDA ratio has since improved to a low $2.56x$. The effect of the Q2 2025 debt refinancing is not yet clear on interest payments.
    *   **Next Step:** Find the company's precise **quarterly Interest Expense** for Q2 2025 (or most recent) to directly compare it with the reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Adjusted EBITDA, which will provide a much clearer and more up-to-date picture of the actual debt servicing risk.

4.  **Investigate Structural Headwinds to Margin Recovery**
    *   **The Problem:** The company's goal is to hit a $35\%+$ Adjusted EBITDA margin, but the Q2 2025 margin is $23.1\%$, and TTM Gross Margin is lower than pre-pandemic. The bear case attributes this to "Increased operating costs and venue expenses."
    *   **Next Step:** Search for management commentary or analyst reports from recent earnings calls to identify the specific, **structural cost pressures** (e.g., higher venue rental costs, labor/staffing costs, marketing inflation) to determine if the $35\%+$ margin target is a realistic long-term goal or structurally impaired.

5.  **Assess Pro Forma Organic Growth Reliability**
    *   **The Problem:** Management emphasizes $5\%$ *Pro Forma Organic Growth* while acknowledging *Reported Organic Growth* was only $0.4\%$ in Q2 2025 and is expected to be *negative* in Q3 2025, suggesting volatility and potential misleading of the "recovery" narrative.
    *   **Next Step:** Search for a detailed explanation of the "event mix" and the full impact of the Las Vegas Convention Center construction to understand how much of the volatility is truly temporary vs. a sign of underlying weakness in the major shows.
