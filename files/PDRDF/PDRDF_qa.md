## Business Summary

Pernod Ricard’s core business model is built on manufacturing, aging, and distributing a portfolio of high-end global spirits and wine brands, such as Jameson, Absolut, and Chivas Regal. The company operates by acquiring or developing brands and then using extensive marketing to position them as premium goods, aiming to encourage customers to spend more (a concept called 'premiumization'). Revenue is primarily driven by international spirits, including whisky, vodka, and cognac. While its customer base is global, encompassing Europe and the Americas, the company heavily relies on wealthy consumers and the rising middle class in fast-growing regions like China and India, often selling through hospitality businesses (bars and restaurants) and large retailers.

## Business Model Risk

One major near-term risk is economic instability; if recessions occur, consumers often cut back on expensive, premium items, directly hurting sales volume and profit margins. Geopolitical tensions are also a constant threat, as trade disputes can lead to sudden tariffs on imported spirits, a risk that has historically impacted sales, especially in the crucial Chinese market. Long-term risks center around changing social habits: the global trend toward healthier lifestyles, moderation, and low- or zero-alcohol consumption poses a structural threat to the industry’s future growth rate. Furthermore, governments worldwide frequently raise 'sin taxes' (alcohol duties) or impose stricter regulations on marketing and sales. Since Pernod Ricard relies on aged stock (like decades-old scotch and cognac), failing to accurately forecast demand 10 to 20 years out could lead to shortages or oversupply, harming future market positioning. All these risks are concerning now because high global inflation is currently squeezing production costs while the push for moderation and regulatory scrutiny intensifies.

## Company History

Pernod Ricard SA is a French company that is the second-largest wine and spirits producer in the world. Its story is one of adapting to prohibition, merging rivals, and aggressively expanding globally.

### **Part 1: The Separate Roots and The Founding Goal**

1.  **The Pernod Origin (1805):** The company's origins trace back to Henri-Louis Pernod, who established an absinthe distillery in France in 1805. Absinthe, a potent spirit flavored with wormwood and other herbs, was incredibly popular at the time.

2.  **The First Major Headwind (1915):** The first major challenge came when the French government banned absinthe production and consumption in 1915 due to concerns about its health effects. This forced the company to stop producing its main product entirely.

3.  **The Innovative Solution (The Pivot):** Pernod adapted by creating new anise-flavored, licorice-tasting aperitifs that mimicked the flavor profile of the banned spirit but without the controversial ingredients. This led to the creation of brands like **Pastis 51** later on.

4.  **The Ricard Origin (1932):** Paul Ricard, a former employee of another spirits company, introduced his own, more refined anise-flavored drink, called **Ricard**, in 1932. This quickly became France's favorite long drink, positioning Ricard as a fierce competitor to Pernod.

5.  **The Second Major Headwind (1940):** Ricard and other pastis producers faced a second prohibition when the Vichy regime in France banned the production of pastis during World War II, though the ban was later lifted in 1944.

6.  **The Merger and Founding Goal (1975):** In 1975, the two powerful, competing French companies, Pernod and Ricard, decided to merge to create **Pernod Ricard SA**. The primary goal of this merger was to combine their strength and market share in France to build a large enough company to compete with major international players.

### **Part 2: Global Expansion and Overcoming Challenges**

7.  **The Market Concentration Problem (Headwind):** After the merger, about 80% of the new company’s sales were concentrated in the French market, which limited their growth potential. This meant any domestic change in alcohol laws or consumer tastes could devastate the business.

8.  **The International Diversification Solution (Innovation/Tailwind):** Pernod Ricard embarked on a massive campaign to diversify their product portfolio and expand into foreign markets. They recognized that growth would be limited if they only relied on French sales, especially of aniseed drinks.

9.  **Early Strategic Acquisitions (Solution):** To quickly establish a global footprint, the company began a series of major acquisitions in the late 1980s and 1990s. Key purchases included Irish Distillers (owner of **Jameson** whiskey) and Orlando Wyndham (makers of **Jacob's Creek** wine).

10. **The Game-Changing Acquisitions (Tailwind):** In the early 2000s, Pernod Ricard made two transformative purchases: a share of Seagram's wine and spirits business in 2001 (acquiring brands like **Chivas Regal** and **The Glenlivet**), and the friendly takeover of Allied Domecq in 2005 (acquiring brands like **Ballantine's** and **Malibu**). These deals instantly propelled the company into the top tier of global wine and spirits producers.

11. **The Modern Expansion (Tailwind):** Another major acquisition in 2008 was Vin & Sprit, the Swedish company that owned **Absolut Vodka**. By constantly buying well-known global brands, the company built one of the world's most prestigious and diverse portfolios of premium spirits.

### **Part 3: Present Day and Future Focus**

12. **The New Headwind (Pandemic and Modern Economy):** More recently, the company faced global economic slowdowns and significant disruptions to sales from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in travel retail and bars.

13. **Modern Innovative Solutions (Adaptability):** Today, Pernod Ricard focuses on using digital tools and data to understand consumers and implement a long-term sustainability roadmap. They are also investing in **regenerative agriculture** to improve soil health and reduce the environmental impact of their ingredients globally.

14. **Current Goal (The Mission):** The company’s core goal remains global leadership, driven by a mission to unlock "the magic of human connections" by bringing "Good Times from a Good Place." They emphasize ethical business and responsible drinking, believing that there is no celebration in excess.

15. **Global Status:** Pernod Ricard has successfully moved far beyond its French roots, now operating in over 160 countries and owning more than 240 premium brands, solidifying its position as the number two worldwide producer of champagnes and spirits.

## Moat Analysis

Pernod Ricard SA’s economic moat—its sustainable competitive advantage—is primarily built on the powerful combination of its portfolio of iconic premium brands and a world-class global distribution network.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and differentiation:

### **The Pernod Ricard Moat**

1.  **Brand Power and Intangible Assets:** Pernod Ricard owns a "House of Brands" with over 200 premium products, including global heavyweights like Jameson, Absolut, Martell, and Chivas Regal, which enjoy immense consumer recognition and emotional attachment. This strong brand equity is the foundation of its competitive advantage, creating a significant barrier to entry in its largest categories.
2.  **Global Distribution Network and Scale:** The company operates one of the most comprehensive wholly-owned global distribution networks, covering over 75 markets, which allows it to get its products onto shelves and into bars worldwide more effectively than smaller competitors. Its sheer scale in procuring raw materials (like barley and grapes) also creates economies of scale, leading to a cost advantage over smaller entrants.
3.  **Scarcity of Aged Spirits:** For premium and prestige products like Scotch whisky and Cognac (e.g., Martell and The Glenlivet), the long aging process creates an inherent scarcity value, which cannot be quickly replicated by a competitor, even one with a lot of money. This scarcity strengthens its pricing power in the luxury segment.

### **Differentiation and Special Market Position**

1.  **Premiumization Strategy:** Pernod Ricard is specifically focused on the "premiumization" trend, offering a diversified portfolio that continually shifts consumers toward higher-quality and more expensive spirits. This strategy allows the company to capture more value from aspirational and affluent consumers globally, a key factor in its growth.
2.  **Special Pricing Power:** The strength of its premium brands gives Pernod Ricard significant pricing power, enabling it to successfully implement price increases and grow its gross margin even when sales volumes are pressured. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for trusted, high-quality, and familiar brands, especially during economic uncertainty.

### **Reasons for Growth and Displacement Difficulty**

1.  **Historical Acquisitive Strategy:** The company grew into its current position through a successful strategy of acquiring and integrating major brands, such as the merger of Pernod and Ricard in 1975, and the subsequent acquisitions of Seagram and Allied Domecq. This aggressive consolidation allowed it to quickly build a globally diversified brand portfolio.
2.  **Hard to Displace by Capital Alone:** While an entrant with vast capital could buy up smaller brands, they would struggle to instantly replicate the decades or centuries of brand history, consumer trust, and the extensive, established distribution network that Pernod Ricard possesses. The cultural weight and heritage of its brands are an intangible asset that money alone cannot buy quickly.
3.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Base:** The company is a producer of consumer staples—spirits that are part of social rituals, traditions, and "moments of conviviality." Many of its Strategic Local Brands, like Ricard or Kahlúa, benefit from very strong local consumer loyalty, which points to sticky, recurring purchases.

### **Moat Creation and Innovation**

1.  **Investment in Brand Building and Insights:** Pernod Ricard constantly works to strengthen its moat by investing heavily in marketing and brand-building to create and maintain deep emotional connections with consumers. The company leverages data and AI through its "Conviviality Platform" and "Insight Factory" to understand consumer behavior and new trends quickly, which informs its strategic decisions and product development.
2.  **Innovation is Key to Staying Ahead:** Although the core products rely on heritage, the company must constantly innovate to keep its edge and stay relevant. This innovation includes creating new products, flavors (like Absolut Wild Berri), and new formats (like Ready-To-Drink cocktails and low- or non-alcoholic options) to address rapidly changing consumer demands. It has also created an innovation center to focus on R&D for local markets like India.

## Catalyst Analysis

Pernod Ricard's catalysts are centered on recovering performance in key markets, leveraging its premium brand portfolio, and realizing operational efficiencies following a period of strategic investment.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 1-2 Years)

1.  **US Market Inventory Normalization:** The current sales slowdown in the crucial US market is partly due to wholesalers adjusting their inventory levels. Management is focused on a new, more effective sales strategy ("Route to Market") and expects the gap between its sales and actual consumer purchases to narrow, which should improve US sales performance.
2.  **China Market Rebound:** While the market in China is currently weak due to a soft macroeconomic environment, a return of consumer confidence would boost sales, especially for its premium portfolio like Martell Cognac.
3.  **Completion of Efficiency Program:** The company is completing a major cost-cutting and efficiency program (€900 million over three years, FY23-FY25), which is driving strong organic operating margin expansion and directly improving profitability.
4.  **Travel Retail Recovery:** The Global Travel Retail business (airport shops) is expected by management to continue its strong rebound and grow faster than the overall market.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Structural Growth Drivers)

1.  **Global Premiumization Trend:** Pernod Ricard is well-positioned for the long-term trend of consumers "drinking less but better," which supports its strategy of investing heavily in and premiumizing its core portfolio.
2.  **Growth in Emerging Markets (Especially India):** Management points to very strong and favorable fundamentals in India, including high GDP growth, a growing middle class, and a massive legal drinking age population, which they anticipate will deliver strong long-term growth.
3.  **Strategic Capacity Investments:** The company has been making large capital expenditure (CapEx) investments, such as doubling capacity for Irish Whiskey in Midleton, which will secure long-term supply for its key high-growth brands like Jameson.
4.  **Active Portfolio Management:** The strategy involves acquiring high-potential brands in key markets and disposing of non-core assets, such as the strategic wine brands, to create a more focused, faster-growing portfolio.

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Commentary

*   **On Investments:** Management states that strategic investments (CapEx and strategic inventories) have peaked in the last fiscal year (FY24) and are expected to decrease in the coming years (e.g., below €900 million for FY26). This shift from high investment to lower spending is anticipated to improve Free Cash Flow significantly.
*   **On Brand Focus:** The CEO of North America has focused on "sharper portfolio prioritization," concentrating efforts on six "power brands" to drive scale (like Jameson and Absolut) and four "explode brands" for future growth.
*   **On Pricing and Margins:** Management is implementing strong pricing policies, supported by revenue growth management and operational efficiencies, to ensure continuous organic gross margin expansion.
*   **On Market Confidence:** Despite acknowledging macroeconomic headwinds in the US and China, management remains "very confident on the underlying fundamentals" and the company's ability to drive its medium-term financial framework.

## Management Record

Based on an analysis of Pernod Ricard SA’s management, here is information relevant to an investor:

### **Current CEO and Management History**

1.  **CEO Background and Family Ties:** Alexandre Ricard, the grandson of founder Paul Ricard, has been the Chairman and CEO since February 2015. He represents the third generation of the Ricard family to lead the company.
2.  **Executive Experience:** Before his CEO role, Alexandre Ricard worked outside the family business for seven years at firms like Accenture and Morgan Stanley (M&A consulting). He then held key internal positions, including CEO of Irish Distillers Group (Jameson whiskey) and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Group.
3.  **Management Transition:** The change in top leadership was part of a planned succession, accelerated in 2012 following the death of his uncle, Patrick Ricard. He formally succeeded Pierre Pringuet, the former CEO, upon Pringuet's mandatory retirement in 2015.

### **Strategic Vision and Key Decisions**

4.  **Core Vision:** Pernod Ricard’s vision centers on being "Créateurs de convivialité" (Creators of conviviality) and aiming to be the preferred house of premium brands and experiences.
5.  **Future Strategy (The Conviviality Platform):** The long-term growth engine is called "The Conviviality Platform," which uses the three-year strategic plan, *Transform & Accelerate*, to leverage consumer trends and deliver profitable growth. The strategy is focused on capitalizing on the "premiumization" trend, especially in emerging markets.
6.  **Key Strategic Decisions (Acquisitions):** Under Alexandre Ricard, the company became a "serial acquirer" of high-end brands to enhance its premium portfolio, acquiring labels like Monkey 47 gin (2016), Del Maguey mezcal (2017), and several US bourbon/whiskey companies including Rabbit Hole and Castle Brands (Jefferson's bourbon) in 2019.
7.  **Geographic Investment:** A significant decision was the $150 million investment in 2019 to build The Chuan Malt Whisky Distillery in China, making it the first international spirits group to produce a single malt in the country.
8.  **Recent Governance Change:** In a 2023 shake-up, the group streamlined its structure by phasing out two regional CEO roles (Asia and EMEA/LATAM) and increasing the size of its Executive Committee to ensure closer market proximity and efficiency.

### **Performance and Shareholder Value**

10. **Dividend and Buybacks:** The company has consistently pursued a policy of growing dividends, with a proposed 14% dividend increase in 2023 to €4.70 per share. In 2019, management also announced a €1 billion share buyback scheme to enhance shareholder return.
11. **Addressing Activist Investors:** In response to public critiques from activist investor Elliot Management in 2018/2019 regarding corporate governance and perceived underperformance, management instituted a board revamp with new non-family director appointments.
12. **Recent Challenges:** Recent periods (FY25 outlook) have been described as "transitory," with organic net sales declining and the company navigating a challenging operating environment in key markets like the USA and China, which has negatively impacted the stock. Management is responding with a strong focus on cost discipline and a new €1 billion efficiency program targeted from FY26 to FY29.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Pernod Ricard SA's management incentive and compensation structure suggests a strong alignment with long-term shareholder interests, primarily driven by a significant founding family stake and a multi-year performance-based compensation plan.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Founding Family Stake:** The "Paul Ricard concert party," which includes the founding family, holds a significant 15.0% of the company's capital, which is a key structural mechanism for long-term shareholder alignment. A high ownership percentage from a founding party inherently incentivizes the protection and long-term value creation of the company, as their wealth is intrinsically linked to the stock's performance.
2.  **Executive Ownership Requirement:** The Chairman & CEO is required to hold a substantial number of registered shares, corresponding to more than three times his gross fixed annual compensation. This high personal financial commitment ensures the chief executive's interests are directly tied to the company's share price performance over time.
3.  **Management/Board Direct Ownership:** The collective ownership by the Board, Management, and Employees, along with Treasury shares, represents a further 2.3% of the capital. While individual insider ownership for officers and directors is below 1%, the significant family concert party and the executive shareholding requirement provide the core long-term incentive.

### **Compensation Structure (Incentive Plans)**

4.  **Long-Term Incentives (LTI) - TSR Focus:** The LTI plan, often granted as performance shares, includes a key metric tied to the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of Pernod Ricard relative to a defined peer group of companies over a three-year vesting period. Tying a portion of the compensation to relative TSR directly aligns management's financial rewards with superior stock performance compared to competitors.
5.  **LTI - Sustainable Growth Metrics:** The remaining portion of the LTI and parts of the variable compensation are linked to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and internal performance criteria. This includes ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and other non-financial goals, suggesting an incentive structure that balances financial results with long-term environmental and operational sustainability.
6.  **Short-Term Variable Compensation:** The annual variable compensation (Short-Term Incentive or STI) for the Chairman & CEO is based on a balanced mix of financial, non-financial, and qualitative criteria, which also includes operational and governance execution goals like the successful implementation of a new organization structure.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

7.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** Based on the high foundational family stake, the substantial executive share ownership requirement (3x fixed salary), and the LTI's explicit link to relative Total Shareholder Return, Pernod Ricard's management appears to have a strong structural incentive to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders.
8.  **Balanced Approach:** The incorporation of significant non-financial/CSR metrics into both the LTI and variable compensation suggests a focus on sustainable value creation rather than incentivizing a purely short-term boost in profits at the expense of long-term health. The structure aims to reward both operational and stock-price outperformance over multi-year periods.

## Price History

Based on the recent price history and technical analysis for Pernod Ricard SA (PDRDF), here is an analysis of the stock's current trading position and the reasons behind its recent movements.

### Pernod Ricard SA (PDRDF) Price Analysis

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **8.23%** above its 52-week low of \$93.40. With a recent price around \$101.09, the stock is much closer to its low than its 52-week high of \$160.25.

2.  **Trading Position (Technical Analysis):** Technically, Pernod Ricard has been in a sustained downward trend since 2023, but has shown signs of finding support near its 52-week low. While some moving average crossovers suggest a potential corrective upward trend, other daily technical indicators on the French listing (PERP) indicate a "Strong Sell" position, although the overall moving average outlook is "Neutral."

3.  **Big Drops Explained:** The stock has significantly underperformed the broader market, dropping by an estimated 8% over the last year, with some analysts noting a *25%+ drop* from previous highs. This decline is largely attributed to ongoing sales slumps and inventory destocking in key markets, specifically China and the United States.

4.  **Sales and Market Headwinds:** The company reported an organic net sales decline of 3% for its last fiscal year, falling short of its medium-term targets. Weak consumer demand and market volatility in China and the US, combined with past tariff uncertainty, created a difficult operating environment, putting pressure on the share price.

5.  **Recent Upward Movement (Bigly Up):** Shares saw a significant single-day jump—rising as much as 8%—following the company's fiscal year 2025 results. The rise was fueled by management's forecast for improving sales trends in fiscal 2026, particularly in the second half, and a lower-than-expected financial impact from new tariffs.

6.  **Valuation and Future Outlook:** Due to the drops, the stock's valuation metrics (like its Price/Earnings ratio) are now below its own long-term average and the sector average, making it look cheap to some analysts. Management is maintaining its long-term guidance for annual organic sales growth of 3% to 6% from 2027 to 2029, suggesting confidence in a recovery post-cyclical headwinds.

---

## Long Thesis

Pernod Ricard is a high-quality global spirits business that is currently trading at a discount because of temporary setbacks, primarily inventory issues in the US and slow consumer spending in China. The core bull case relies on a near-term rebound and strong, structural long-term growth.

Near-Term (Recovery):
The recent stock drop is primarily due to temporary wholesale inventory corrections in the crucial US market and economic weakness in China. As these markets normalize, sales will quickly recover. Management is currently finalizing a major cost-cutting program and reducing large capital investments (like building distilleries), which will translate the recovering sales into much higher profit margins and stronger free cash flow over the next one to two years.

Long-Term (Structural Growth):
The company owns a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable premium brands (like Jameson and Martell) that give it superior pricing power. It is perfectly positioned to profit from the global trend of 'drinking less but better'—where consumers continually upgrade to higher-quality, more expensive spirits. This trend, combined with the rapid expansion of the middle class in huge emerging markets, particularly India, ensures a stable engine for profit growth that is very difficult for competitors to displace. The management team, backed by the founding family, is incentivized for long-term growth and capital efficiency.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case depends on several key assumptions holding true:

1. Economic Recovery: Consumer confidence and spending must rebound in the major markets of the US and China, allowing distributors to normalize their inventory levels and boost sales, especially for expensive products like Martell Cognac.
2. Premiumization Trend Persistence: Global consumers must continue to prioritize higher-end, premium spirits despite ongoing inflationary pressures or economic slowdowns.
3. Regulatory Stability: Governments worldwide must avoid imposing severely restrictive 'sin taxes' or sweeping bans on alcohol advertising that would fundamentally damage profit margins and access to key markets.
4. Successful Execution: Management must successfully implement its cost-cutting programs and integrate strategic acquisitions to deliver the promised margin expansion and improved free cash flow efficiency.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Pernod Ricard is built on an optimistic view of a cyclical recovery and a reliance on structural trends. However, recent facts and market data suggest the headwinds are more structural, geopolitical, and long-lasting than the thesis acknowledges.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **The "Temporary Setback" is Systemic and Geopolitical:** The decline is not merely a short-term inventory correction. The company is battling a fundamental *downturn in spirits demand* and *subdued consumer confidence* in the U.S., resulting in a 6-7% sales decline for the last fiscal year and a slow recovery not expected until the second half of fiscal year 2026.
2.  **China Risk is Elevated to a Trade War, Not Just Economic Weakness:** The 21-25% sales drop in China is driven not only by a weak economy and reduced gifting but also by **anti-dumping tariffs on European brandy** which has critically hit its flagship Martell Cognac brand. This elevates the risk from a cyclical economic issue to an unquantifiable geopolitical/regulatory one, with a delayed recovery likely for key premium brands.
3.  **The "Premiumization" Trend is Decelerating and Uneven:** The structural trend of "drinking less but better" is losing momentum under inflation. While ultra-premium ($30.50+) spirits may still be showing growth, the main *Premium* price tier is slowing down as cost-of-living pressures force consumers to cut back or consider "trading down." Pernod's reliance on high pricing power is thus vulnerable to a prolonged global economic squeeze.
4.  **Regulatory Stability Assumption is Proven False:** The thesis assumes a stable regulatory environment, yet Pernod is already dealing with severe impacts from **China tariffs**, expected negative impacts from **excise policy changes in Maharashtra, India**, and the **threat of US trade tariffs**. Furthermore, new, extremely strict alcohol advertising and promotion laws have recently been enacted in Thailand, limiting major brand sponsorships and marketing.
5.  **Cost-Cutting is a Sign of Defense, Not Growth Leverage:** Management’s initiative to implement a major restructuring, known as "Tomorrow 2," and target an additional €1 billion in cost savings by 2029 (on top of €900 million already delivered) indicates they are in a defensive position. These massive cuts are a necessity to defend margins against collapsing revenues, not just a plan to translate recovering sales into incrementally higher profits.
6.  **Concentration Risk in Key Brands/Markets is High:** The sales decline is heavily concentrated in the Martell Cognac brand (contributing to ~90% of the H1 FY25 decline), which is highly dependent on the stressed China market. This exposure makes the entire company's earnings vulnerable to a slow/non-recovering ultra-premium gifting market in a single country.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for Pernod Ricard

The current challenges facing Pernod Ricard are not fleeting cyclical setbacks but reflect a permanent shift toward a more difficult operating environment defined by geopolitical risk and a stressed consumer.

1.  **Protracted De-Stocking and Weak Demand:** The near-term recovery is severely delayed, with sales expected to decline further in the first half of the new fiscal year due to lingering U.S. inventory adjustments and sustained weak consumer sentiment in key markets. The downturn in spirits demand post-pandemic is proving structural, not cyclical, preventing a quick rebound.
2.  **Geopolitical Risk Erodes High-Margin Segments:** The critical high-margin Martell Cognac business will face a sustained headwind due to the China anti-dumping tariff regime, which may be a long-term fixture of trade relations rather than a temporary event. This risk is compounded by continuous global trade tensions that can impose further tariffs on the company’s supply chain without warning.
3.  **Premiumization Trend is Fragmenting:** While the company's long-term thesis relies on consumers *trading up*, persistent global inflation and cost-of-living pressures are causing a slowdown in the core premium category and a potential trade-down to cheaper alternatives or a shift in focus to the high-growth Ready-To-Drink (RTD) sector, where margins are traditionally lower. This will pressure the company's gross margin and profitability mix.
4.  **Efficiency Gains Mask Revenue Failure:** While aggressive cost-cutting and a large-scale restructuring will defend operating margins, these efficiency gains are a reaction to revenue failure, not a driver of sustainable growth. The significant cuts and reorganization may cause internal disruption and distract from the necessary innovation and marketing spend required to reignite top-line growth.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive qualitative analysis, the next steps must focus on validating the core assumptions and risks with hard financial and specific geopolitical/market data.

The key questions left unanswered relate to the company's valuation, balance sheet health, the true *duration* of the China tariff issue, and the specifics of the India growth engine's regulatory risk.

## Next Steps for Investigation (Important Unanswered Questions)

### **1. Financial Health and Valuation Metrics**

The long thesis claims the stock is trading at a "discount" with expectations of "higher profit margins and stronger free cash flow." This must be validated.

*   **Current Valuation:** What are Pernod Ricard’s latest TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) Price/Earnings (P/E) and Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratios? This will help confirm if the current valuation (P/E of 12.98, EV/EBITDA of 10.58) is truly a discount compared to its 5-year average and the peer group median.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** What is Pernod Ricard's recent ROIC (e.g., 6.20%) and how does it trend historically? A high ROIC validates the quality of the moat (Intangible Assets and Scarcity of Aged Spirits) by showing how efficiently management uses investor capital.
*   **Balance Sheet Strength:** What is the current Net Debt/EBITDA ratio (e.g., 3.1x in FY24)? This is crucial, as the ratio has increased and a high number could limit future acquisitions or force CapEx cutbacks if the sales slump is prolonged.

### **2. Geopolitical and Major Market Risk Deep Dive (China)**

The bear case heavily relies on the China anti-dumping tariff being a major, long-term threat to the high-margin Martell Cognac brand.

*   **China Tariff Resolution and Exemption:** Search for the latest update on the China anti-dumping tariff on European brandy. Specifically, did Pernod Ricard secure an exemption from the tariffs of up to 34.9% (starting July 2025) by agreeing to a *minimum price commitment*? This would lessen the impact compared to the bear case scenario, although it still presents a "degraded situation."
*   **Travel Retail Impact:** What is the status of the duty-free market in China, as Cognac was reportedly excluded from it? This channel traditionally represents about 20% of Cognac sales in China and its continued exclusion is a significant, structural headwind.

### **3. Validation of Key Growth Engine Risk (India)**

The long-term thesis heavily depends on India, but a regulatory risk was mentioned.

*   **Quantify India Risk:** India is Pernod Ricard's second-largest market, contributing 13% of global sales in FY24. The bear case mentions the **Maharashtra excise duty hike** (reportedly 50%); investigate the specific financial impact on sales volumes and how long management expects this setback to last before the "strong growth momentum" is restored.
*   **"Drinking Less But Better" in Emerging Markets:** Investigate the price points of the fastest-growing brands in India (like Royal Stag, Absolut) to confirm that growth is still driven by the high-margin premium segment, rather than lower-margin mass-market products.

### **4. Comparative Analysis with Main Rival (Diageo)**

Pernod Ricard is the #2 global spirits player; a comparison with the #1 player, Diageo (DEO), will benchmark its current performance and valuation.

*   **Growth and Margin Comparison:** Compare the organic sales growth (Pernod: -1% in FY24; Diageo: -0.6% in FY24) and operating margins between Pernod Ricard and Diageo. Historically, Diageo has often shown better financial management and higher margins, which would challenge the "high-quality" claim for Pernod.
*   **Future Guidance:** Compare the full-year guidance for organic sales and profit margins for FY25 for both companies. The differing guidance will provide clarity on which company is navigating the US and China headwinds more effectively.
