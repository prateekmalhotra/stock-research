## Business Summary

XP Inc. is a leading Brazilian financial services platform that focuses on providing investment, wealth management, and digital banking services. The company primarily serves affluent and high-net-worth retail investors across Brazil, though it is also growing its presence among institutional clients. Its core business model is based on an “open architecture” approach, meaning it operates as a marketplace offering a wide range of financial products, such as stocks, bonds, and funds, from many different issuers, rather than just selling its own proprietary products. XP generates most of its revenue by charging transaction fees and commissions when customers buy and sell assets. It also earns money through management fees on the assets it oversees and from the interest earned on customer cash deposits.

## Business Model Risk

One major near-term risk is intense competitive pressure, often referred to as 'fee compression.' XP's primary income stream comes from transaction fees, and if large incumbent Brazilian banks and other fintech competitors continue to lower their own brokerage fees, XP will be forced to follow suit, directly reducing its profits. A significant long-term risk relates to its distribution model, which heavily relies on a vast network of independent financial advisors. Any adverse regulatory change that alters how these advisors are paid or supervised could severely disrupt the company’s ability to acquire and service clients. Historically, the fight against the massive, traditional Brazilian banks has been a constant threat. While XP successfully disrupted them by offering better service and lower fees, these banks are currently fighting back by heavily investing in their own digital platforms and lowering commissions, posing a substantial risk to XP’s future market share gains and earnings growth, especially during periods of economic slowdown.

## Company History

This history of XP Inc. (XP) details its journey from a small startup to a major financial powerhouse in Brazil, focusing on its disruptive model and the challenges it overcame.

### I. Inception and Founding Goal (2001-2006)

1.  **Humble Beginnings:** XP Inc. was founded in 2001 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, by Guilherme Benchimol and Marcelo Maisonnave, starting from a small 25-square-meter office with an initial investment of about $5,000.
2.  **The Problem to Solve:** The Brazilian financial market was historically controlled by a few massive, traditional banks (an oligopoly) that offered a limited range of costly investment products and services to customers. Most people kept their money in low-yield savings accounts or products promoted by their main bank, without access to better alternatives.
3.  **The Core Goal (Democratization):** XP's founding mission was to "democratize financial investments in Brazil" by giving ordinary people transparent information and a wide array of investment choices previously available only to the wealthy or institutional investors.
4.  **Initial Business Model:** The company started not as a traditional broker, but as an office of **Independent Financial Agents** focused primarily on financial education and teaching people how to invest outside of the big banks.

### II. Innovative Solutions and Growth (2007-2019)

1.  **Becoming a Broker (2007):** XP evolved into a formal broker-dealer by acquiring an existing brokerage operation, which allowed them to execute trades and directly challenge the established financial institutions.
2.  **The "Open Platform" Model:** XP pioneered a model where it offered an open platform, acting as a one-stop-shop for a vast selection of investment products from many different companies and fund managers, not just their own. This provided customers with more choice and competition than the traditional banks.
3.  **The Independent Advisor Network:** A key strategy was building a large, nationwide network of **Independent Financial Advisors (IFAs)** who work on commissions and are separate from the big banks. These advisors provided personalized guidance to help transition clients away from their traditional banks, becoming a major distribution channel.
4.  **Scaling Through Acquisition and Brand Building:** The company grew rapidly by acquiring smaller, focused platforms, such as **InfoMoney** (a major financial news website), **Clear** (an online-only platform for active traders), and **Rico** (focused on digital-native investors). These acquisitions helped them reach different customer segments and consolidate their market presence.
5.  **International Recognition (IPO):** XP's exponential growth led to a major milestone in 2019: a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq in New York, which valued the company at several billion dollars and gave it access to global capital.

### III. Headwinds, Tailwinds, and Present Strategy (2019-Present)

#### **Tailwinds (Favorable Conditions)**

1.  **Low Interest Rates (2020-2021):** A significant tailwind was the period where the Brazilian central bank lowered its basic interest rate (Selic) to historical lows (down to around 2%). Low rates made safer fixed-income investments less attractive, prompting a large number of investors to move money into riskier, higher-fee products like stocks and funds, which greatly boosted XP's revenue and stock price.
2.  **Digitalization and Open Banking:** The government's regulatory push for digitalization and the implementation of open banking systems (allowing customers to easily share their financial data) created an "irreversible" market shift. This environment pressures traditional banks and favors tech-driven financial challengers like XP.

#### **Headwinds (Challenges Faced)**

1.  **Competition and Regulatory Scrutiny:** As XP grew, competition intensified, with both big incumbent banks launching their own digital services and new fintech startups emerging. Additionally, the company faced various regulatory proceedings and even a class-action lawsuit following its IPO concerning alleged insufficient disclosures.
2.  **High Interest Rates (2022-2023):** The single biggest challenge in recent years was the significant increase in the Selic interest rate, which rose back up to double digits (over 10%). This high-rate environment slowed XP's growth because investors migrated back to low-risk fixed-income products, which generate less commission and lower the overall revenue percentage ("take rate") XP earns from client assets.
3.  **Reputational and Short-Seller Allegations:** The company has dealt with public scrutiny, including a high-profile short-seller report in 2025 that accused the company of running a "Madoff-like Ponzi scheme" through complex investment products, which XP vehemently denied and publicly refuted as baseless.

#### **Innovative Solution to Headwinds (Diversification)**

1.  **Becoming a Full-Service Platform:** To make the business more resilient to fluctuating interest rates and to maintain growth, XP broadened its offerings beyond just investments.
2.  **New Verticals for Resilience:** The company launched new business verticals, including digital accounts, credit cards, loans, and insurance products. This strategy of cross-selling basic banking services to their existing investor client base successfully added billions in revenue, making XP a more comprehensive financial services platform.

## Moat Analysis

XP Inc.'s moat is built less on pure price advantage today and more on its unique hybrid model that combines a technology-driven "open platform" with an enormous human network of financial advisors, which was a massive disruption to Brazil’s traditional, highly concentrated banking sector.

### Analysis of XP Inc.'s Competitive Moat

1.  **Open Platform and Product Breadth (The Initial Moat):** XP pioneered an "open platform" model in Brazil, which allowed clients to access a vast array of investment products—including funds and securities from competitors and partner companies—instead of being limited to the few, often high-fee products offered by major incumbent banks.
2.  **Extensive Advisor Network (Distribution Moat):** The company built an extensive network of over 18,200 financial advisors, both independent and internal. This massive "feet on the street" distribution channel provides personalized service and financial education, acting as a crucial bridge to attract and retain affluent and high net-worth clients who were historically underserved by the quality of advice at large banks.
3.  **Client-Centric Culture & Brand (Intangible Asset):** XP’s early success was driven by a culture focused on client education and transparency, directly challenging the high-fee, opaque practices of traditional Brazilian banks. This strong brand as the "investor's champion" is a reputation-based advantage that is difficult for competitors to replicate quickly.

### Differentiation and Pricing Power

1.  **Pricing Power is Shifting:** XP's initial differentiation was radically undercutting the high fees of large banks, often offering low or zero commissions on certain products. However, increased competition from incumbent banks and new fintechs is pressuring fees, causing XP's overall "take rate" (revenue per asset) to decline in some areas.
2.  **Special Position in the Market:** Its special position is being the **leading retail investment platform** in Brazil, holding a significant market share in individual equities. It has successfully moved from being just a broker to offering a complete financial ecosystem that includes banking, credit, and insurance.
3.  **Differentiation is Quality of Advice:** The key differentiator today is less about price and more about providing high-quality, personalized financial advisory services and holistic financial planning that goes beyond simple investment execution.

### Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk

1.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Relationships:** Customer relationships are sticky and recurring, built on the trust developed through personalized advisory services. Furthermore, the company's aggressive strategy of cross-selling non-investment products (like credit cards, loans, insurance, and digital accounts) deepens the client relationship and increases the cost and inconvenience for a client to leave.
2.  **Transition to Fee-Based Revenue:** XP is actively transitioning a portion of its business toward a **fee-based advisory model**, where the company charges a recurring fee based on the assets under management, making the revenue stream more stable and sticky over time.
3.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** While a competitor with more capital can easily enter the market, displacing XP is difficult because of its well-established, self-reinforcing ecosystem. The enormous scale of its advisor network and the deep integration of cross-sold products create significant switching costs for clients, making it more resilient than a simple digital platform. The risk comes from incumbent banks with vast capital catching up and replicating the technology and service model.

### Actions to Create a Solid Moat (R&D and Innovation)

1.  **Investment in Technology and Platform:** XP operates as a technology-driven platform, continuously investing in its digital user experience to give clients access to diverse products and financial advice.
2.  **Innovation through Product Access:** The company constantly innovates by bringing new, previously inaccessible investment vehicles to the Brazilian investor, such as global and thematic funds that offer exposure to international growth stories like the Nasdaq 100 Index.
3.  **Network Effects from the Ecosystem:** The platform operates as a self-reinforcing ecosystem: a broad base of clients attracts more financial advisors and third-party product providers, which in turn offers more product choice and better service, further attracting more clients—making the platform more valuable as it grows.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts for XP Inc. (XP) stock price can be categorized into factors that may positively impact the stock in the near term (next 6-12 months) and the long term (1-3+ years).

***

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6–12 Months)

1.  **High Capital Returns to Shareholders:** Management is explicitly targeting a high payout ratio of more than 50% of net income for 2025 and 2026, through a combination of dividends and share buyback programs. This directly enhances shareholder value and can support the stock price.

2.  **Continued Strong Profitability and Efficiency:** The company has been consistently achieving record-high quarterly adjusted net income and a high Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), demonstrating its ability to grow with profitability. Management is focused on strict cost control and operational efficiency, which helps maintain strong profit margins even in a challenging economic environment.

3.  **Growth in Fixed Income and Corporate Business:** Management has highlighted the strong performance of its retail fixed-income segment and its corporate and issuer services. The success in its corporate business is due to its unique position in wholesale banking, particularly in structuring and distributing corporate credit.

***

### Long-Term Catalysts (1–3+ Years)

1.  **Shift to Higher-Margin Products from Lower Brazilian Interest Rates:** A potential decline in the Brazilian interest rate environment would likely make fixed-income investments less appealing and encourage clients to move into higher-margin products like equities, mutual funds, and more sophisticated investments. This shift would directly boost XP's overall revenue and profit margins.

2.  **Achievement of Financial Targets and Operating Leverage:** Management is working towards its midterm guidance to reach a pre-tax profit margin (EBT margin) between $\text{30\%}$ and $\text{34\%}$ by the end of 2026. Meeting this goal would demonstrate significant operating leverage and business scale, which is a major long-term stock price driver.

3.  **Ecosystem Expansion and Client Monetization:** The company’s long-term strategy is to "dominate the investment industry in Brazil" and "expand the ecosystem" beyond its core investment platform into other financial services. This expansion, coupled with improving client segmentation and product innovation, aims to increase the client base and the revenue generated from each client through cross-selling services like credit cards, insurance, and lending.

4.  **Optimizing the Capital Structure:** Management intends to reduce its managerial Basel index (a measure of capital held) from current comfortable levels to a target range of $\text{16\%}$ to $\text{19\%}$. This strategy aims to free up capital, which can be deployed for profitable growth or returned to shareholders, resulting in higher returns on equity over time.

## Management Record

Based on the analysis of XP Inc.'s management, history, and strategic direction, the following points are relevant to an investor:

### **Current Management and Background**

1.  **Founder's Continued Role:** Guilherme Benchimol, the company's founder, stepped down as CEO in May 2021 to assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board, focusing on the company's long-term strategic growth, innovation, expansion, and M&A.
2.  **CEO Appointment and Focus:** Thiago Maffra, who joined XP in 2015 and previously served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), was appointed CEO in May 2021. This change was part of a strategy to accelerate the company's digital transformation, shifting its focus to a model where "technology empowers clients."
3.  **Management Alignment:** The senior executives, including the new CEO, are shareholders of **XP Controle**, the holding company, which helps ensure a strong alignment of management and founder interests with shareholder value creation.
4.  **Team Experience:** The core management team is considered experienced, with an average tenure of approximately 4.5 years, suggesting stability and deep operational knowledge within the company.

### **Historical Track Record and Key Decisions**

5.  **Foundational Disruption:** XP was founded in 2001 with a mission to democratize financial investments in Brazil, historically challenging the dominance of large incumbent banks by focusing on financial education and an open platform model.
6.  **Strategic Growth through Acquisitions:** Key past decisions include an aggressive strategy of strategic acquisitions, notably Ameritrade Brazil (2007), Clear Corretora (2014), and Rico Corretora (2016), which significantly boosted market presence and client base.
7.  **Successful Capital Raise and Internationalization:** The management successfully led the company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on Nasdaq in 2019, which was the largest IPO by a Brazilian company at the time, providing substantial capital for further expansion.
8.  **Digital Leadership Emphasis:** Under the current management structure, a major decision was elevating the head of technology (Maffra) to CEO, successfully driving a "highly successful digital transformation" and rapidly scaling the in-house technology team.

### **Performance and Shareholder Value Delivery**

9.  **Recent Financial Performance:** Management has delivered strong and increasing profitability, reporting a record net income of R$1.3 billion in Q2 2025 (up 18% year-over-year) and a high Return on Equity (ROE) of 24.4%.
10. **Client Growth and Asset Capture:** The company has demonstrated a robust track record of growth, increasing its total client assets under custody and administration to R$1.9 trillion and its active client base to 4.7 million as of Q2 2025.
11. **Commitment to Capital Returns:** Management has committed to returning over 50% of net income to shareholders in 2025 and 2026 via dividends and share buybacks; a BRL1 billion share repurchase program has been actively reducing the share count and helping to boost diluted EPS by 22% year-over-year in Q2 2025.
12. **Management Risk/Popularity Note:** While the overall trend is positive, the company's stock has faced volatility, including a sharp drop in 2025, partly due to a legal dispute involving a short-seller report that raised concerns about alleged Ponzi schemes and potential regulatory risks, indicating a need for careful investor monitoring of reputational and legal matters.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of XP Inc.'s regulatory filings (primarily its Form 20-F), the management incentive and compensation structure exhibits a mix of strong long-term shareholder alignment, tempered by a dominant control structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for XP Inc. (XP)**

1.  **High Insider Voting Control:** The company operates with a dual-class share structure, where the entity controlled by the executive statutory directors, XP Control, owns approximately **66.6% of the combined voting power** as of December 31, 2023. This high degree of voting control is much greater than their economic ownership (18.8% of issued share capital) and allows the management group to control strategic decisions, including compensation, regardless of public shareholder opposition.

2.  **Significant Equity-Based Compensation:** The core compensation philosophy dictates that a **majority of executive pay is "at risk"** and tied to performance, aligning management's success with the creation of long-term value. This strategy is executed through a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan as part of its "meritocratic partnership structure."

3.  **Use of Performance-Based Equity (TSR):** The LTI plan includes **Performance Share Units (PSUs)**, whose vesting is explicitly conditioned on the company's **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, directly linking a portion of executive wealth to shareholder returns. This is considered a strong mechanism for aligning management with shareholder interests.

4.  **Incentives for Retention (Service-Based RSUs):** The LTI plan also utilizes **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**, which are primarily **service-related** and vest over time. While these help with executive retention, they dilute shareholder equity and reward employees simply for staying, rather than for specific performance achievements.

5.  **Compensation Governance:** Executive compensation, including the short- and long-term incentive components, is determined by the Compensation, People, Nominating and Governance Committee, which is tasked with reviewing and developing the overall compensation philosophy and strategy.

### **Conclusion: Alignment with Shareholder Interests**

The management has a **high incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders** due to two primary factors:

*   **Financial Alignment:** The significant use of equity in the compensation structure and the vesting of Performance Share Units (PSUs) being tied to **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** ensures that management is heavily incentivized by the long-term appreciation of the stock price.
*   **Founder/Controller Alignment:** The controlling group's **66.6% voting power** is directly tied to their large (though not majority) economic stake (18.8% of capital) in the company, meaning a drop in the share price would destroy a significant portion of their personal wealth.

However, the **dual-class share structure represents a major corporate governance concern for public shareholders** as the management/founders maintain overwhelming voting power (66.6% of the vote) even if their economic ownership is significantly lower. This imbalance means that while their personal financial incentive is aligned with stock appreciation, they are structurally insulated from removal by public shareholders.

## Price History

Based on a recent price analysis and technical indicators, here is an analysis of XP Inc. (XP).

### XP Inc. (XP) Price Analysis

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is trading near the high end of its 52-week range, which is **$10.82 to $20.64**. As of recent data, with a price around $18.80, the stock is significantly closer to its high than its low.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** XP Inc. (XP) is currently trading approximately **73.75% above its 52-week low** of $10.82. This significant rebound from its low point indicates a strong upward trend over the past year.

3.  **Is It Trading Low? (Technical Analysis):** Based purely on technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the stock is generally viewed as **Neutral** (RSI around 50-61), which means it is neither oversold (trading too low) nor overbought. However, multiple Moving Averages (MA50, MA100, MA200) currently show **Buy signals**, indicating a prevailing long-term upward trend.

4.  **Is It Undervalued? (Fundamental View):** Despite not being "low" from a technical standpoint, some fundamental analyses suggest the stock may be **undervalued** compared to its intrinsic value. Its low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and a Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio of 0.27 suggest it could be inexpensive relative to its earnings growth potential.

### Explanation of Recent Price Movement

5.  **Big Gains in the Last Few Months:** The stock has seen a significant run-up, gaining over **28% in the last three months** and over **27% in the last six months**. This period of strong growth followed the stock hitting its 52-week low earlier in the cycle.

6.  **Reason for the Upswing:** A major factor for the strong performance has been **solid earnings reports**, with the company topping analysts' consensus estimates for quarters like Q1 2025. The company has also demonstrated **robust earnings growth**, with analysts forecasting continued expansion, which has been supported by the growth of Brazil's middle class and a broader shift toward digital investment platforms.

7.  **Analyst Outlook:** The consensus rating from a number of analysts is a **"Strong Buy" or "Moderate Buy,"** with an average 12-month price target that suggests a potential upside of over 20% from recent prices.

## Long Thesis

XP Inc. is expected to achieve significant growth and profitability because it is successfully transforming from a specialized investment brokerage into a comprehensive, full-service financial ecosystem in Brazil. In the near term, the company is highly profitable and demonstrates strong financial discipline, actively rewarding shareholders through large dividends and stock buybacks. Its aggressive move into new areas like credit cards, digital banking, and insurance is making its revenue streams more stable and reliable, reducing its reliance on fluctuating market activity. Long term, the core investment business is poised for explosive growth if Brazil's historically high interest rates eventually decline. A drop in rates would push millions of investors out of low-fee savings accounts and into higher-margin products (like stocks and specialized funds) where XP dominates. The company's massive, trusted network of independent financial advisors provides a crucial, human-touch competitive advantage, ensuring client loyalty and high switching costs as XP cross-sells more banking services and increases its overall market share.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that Brazilian interest rates must fall significantly from their recent high levels, which is crucial for maximizing revenue from higher-margin investment products (equities, funds). The thesis also assumes that XP can continue to successfully gain market share against the massive, incumbent Brazilian banks and that its aggressive cross-selling strategy into credit and insurance verticals will continue to deepen client relationships and increase the revenue generated per customer. Finally, competitive pressures that cause 'fee compression' (lower transaction fees) must not erode profitability faster than the company can generate new assets and achieve operating efficiency.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bullish thesis for XP Inc. is strong on future potential but rests on several optimistic assumptions that face significant and measurable headwinds. The critique and bear case below highlight the main vulnerabilities and potential flaws in the long thesis.

### Critique and Identified Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **The "Low-Rate Explosion" Catalyst is Slow and Uncertain, while High Rates are Hurting Now.**
    *   The core assumption that a *significant* drop in Brazil's Selic rate will trigger explosive growth is a high-risk gamble. Current forecasts for the Selic rate project a gradual easing, trending to around 10.50% to 12.50% in the next couple of years, with some long-term forecasts around 9% by 2027–2028. This gradual pace means the massive investor migration from low-fee fixed income to high-margin products (equities/funds) will be slower and less dramatic than the thesis implies.
    *   Crucially, the current high-rate environment has already depressed XP's profitability, causing its "take rate" (revenue as a percentage of Assets under Custody) to fall from approximately 1.5% to 1.0% as investors prefer lower-commission fixed-income products. This erosion of margins is a tangible *current* cost that undercuts the narrative of strong financial discipline and profitability.

2.  **Market Share Gains are Slowing and Competition is Intensifying in the Core Business.**
    *   The thesis assumes a smooth path to gaining market share against incumbent banks. However, competition from large, sophisticated players like **BTG Pactual** and incumbent banks has significantly intensified. BTG Pactual has become a major competitor in the core investment platform and is even estimated by some to be equal in size in assets under custody.
    *   This fierce rivalry has contributed to the ongoing downward trend in XP's take rate, indicating that competitive pressure (fee compression) is successfully eroding the company's profitability in its main line of business faster than new assets can be generated.

3.  **New Cross-Sell Verticals (Credit/Banking) are Not Yet High-Margin Anchors.**
    *   The reliance on credit cards and digital banking for stable, reliable revenue is flawed because XP primarily targets an affluent client base that is considered "prime." These clients typically pay their credit card bills in full, meaning XP generates only about 10% of its credit card revenue from high-margin interest payments, with the rest coming from lower-margin interchange fees and foreign exchange.
    *   This limits the profitability and revenue *stability* that a traditional bank's lending business would provide, challenging the assertion that these new verticals are making revenue streams "more stable and reliable" in a high-interest rate environment.

4.  **The Independent Financial Advisor (IFA) Network is a Double-Edged Sword.**
    *   While the network provides a "human-touch competitive advantage," this model creates a high degree of dependence on third-party channels. The advisors are independent and can be poached by aggressive rivals like BTG Pactual or large incumbent banks offering more favorable terms, potentially leading to the sudden loss of both advisors *and* their associated client assets.
    *   The "human-touch" comes at a cost, creating higher variable expenses compared to a fully automated digital-only model, which could hamper XP's operating leverage if fee compression accelerates.

---

### Bear Case Thesis for XP Inc. (XP)

**XP Inc. is an asset-gathering business whose premium profitability is fundamentally threatened by a combination of margin erosion, protracted macroeconomic headwinds, and rapidly intensifying competition from better-capitalized rivals.**

1.  **The Margin Compression Threat is Structural and Enduring:** Increased competition from aggressive investment banks like BTG Pactual and the technological catch-up by large incumbent banks will continue to put severe, sustained pressure on XP's brokerage and asset management fees. The decline in XP's overall "take rate" is evidence that these margin pressures are already active and will likely continue to erode profitability faster than cost-cutting or new asset growth can compensate.
2.  **Lack of High-Margin Stability in New Verticals:** The expansion into credit cards and banking services will fail to provide the high-margin, stable revenue streams typical of traditional banks. XP’s prime, high-net-worth client base is low-risk but also low-return, as they do not generate significant high-interest credit revenue. This means the diversification effort is capital-intensive without delivering the expected high-margin stability, making the company still highly dependent on the more volatile core investment business.
3.  **The Interest Rate Catalyst is Too Slow to Matter:** The expected explosion in high-margin product revenue from an interest rate decline will be negated by a combination of a more gradual rate cut cycle (pushing out the full benefit years into the future) and the aforementioned structural fee compression. XP’s profitability will be squeezed from both sides: *current* high rates depressing the *mix* of assets, and *competitive* pressure depressing the *fee* on those assets, resulting in a prolonged period of stagnant or falling revenue per client.
4.  **Advisory Channel Vulnerability:** The heavy reliance on the Independent Financial Advisor (IFA) network exposes the company to attrition risk. If a competitor offers a more attractive revenue split or better product platform, a mass defection of IFAs could lead to significant and immediate loss of client assets under custody, rapidly undermining the "trusted network" advantage that is so central to the bull case.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis provides a strong foundation by defining the core conflict (Selic rate dependency, margin compression vs. diversification) and identifying the main governance concern (dual-class shares).

However, the debate between the bull and bear case cannot be resolved without investigating the most current quantitative data and comparing the key rival.

Here are the most important next steps for investigation, focusing on resolving the core assumptions of the long and bear theses:

1.  **Re-Assess the Core Macro Catalyst (Selic Rate):**
    *   The bear case hinges on the Selic rate cutting cycle being too slow to trigger explosive growth. Recent data suggests the rate was at $15.00\%$ in mid-2025, with forecasts of a gradual easing to $12.50\%$ by the end of 2026, and a final terminal rate of $9\%-10.5\%$ by 2027–2028.
    *   **Action:** Investigate the latest consensus view (e.g., Brazilian Central Bank's Focus Report) for the **specific timing of rate cuts** in late 2025/early 2026 to confirm if the *slow* rate of decline is still the prevailing consensus or if recent economic data suggests an acceleration. This directly validates or refutes the timing assumption in the long thesis.

2.  **Quantify and Track the Margin Compression ("Take Rate"):**
    *   The bear case claims margin erosion is structural. Recent reports indicate the annualized retail take rate was **$1.25\%$ in Q1 2025** and **$1.29\%$ in Q2 2024**, showing some stabilization and a small quarter-over-quarter drop, which management has said is not a significant headwind.
    *   **Action:** Find the latest **Q3/Q4 2025** earnings results to determine if the take rate has broken below $1.25\%$ or has stabilized/improved. A continued decline would validate the bear's structural margin compression argument, while stabilization would strengthen the bull's case for operational efficiency.

3.  **Evaluate the Profitability of New Verticals (Cross-Sell Strategy):**
    *   The bear case suggests the new credit/banking verticals are low-margin for XP's affluent client base. Current financial statements provide revenue segment breakdowns but often lack profitability detail. Retail revenue is now driven mostly by fixed-income, with "Other Retail" (which includes digital account, credit card, and insurance) growing quickly, but the margin contribution is opaque.
    *   **Action:** Search for more granular **profitability or Gross Margin data specifically for the Credit, Banking, and Insurance segments**. If the operating margins on these new services are high, it refutes the bear case that diversification is low-margin and proves XP is building stable, high-quality recurring revenue.

4.  **Perform a Direct Competitive and Market Share Analysis vs. BTG Pactual:**
    *   BTG Pactual is repeatedly mentioned as the major rival, competing directly on investment platforms and IFA recruitment.
    *   **Action:** Find a **direct, third-party comparison** of XP and BTG Pactual's retail platforms, focusing on: 1) **Assets Under Custody (AuC) market share** in the retail segment to determine who is truly "winning," and 2) **IFA network size and compensation models** to assess the advisor attrition risk mentioned in the bear case.

5.  **Address the Corporate Governance Risk (Dual-Class Shares):**
    *   The analysis identified the dual-class share structure as a major concern (founders control $66.6\%$ of the vote with only $18.8\%$ economic ownership). There is no recent evidence of a sunset provision or resolution [cite: Management incentive].
    *   **Action:** Investigate any recent **shareholder proposals, management commentary, or regulatory actions in Brazil or the U.S. (Nasdaq)** regarding the dual-class structure since the IPO. An active plan to reduce this governance risk would be a significant positive catalyst for institutional investors.
