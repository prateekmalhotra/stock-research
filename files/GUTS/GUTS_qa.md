## Business Summary

Fractyl Health, Inc. is a company focused on developing therapies for conditions like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatopathic liver disease (MASLD) and type 2 diabetes. Their core business model revolves around a dual approach: developing a medical device therapy (known as Revita DMR) that aims to reset the metabolic dysfunction in the liver and pancreas, and also pursuing a complementary therapeutic drug (FG-3274) that targets the same biological pathways. They primarily operate in the business-to-business (B2B) space, targeting healthcare providers, hospitals, and potentially pharmaceutical partners who would administer or further develop their therapies. Geographically, their customer base is expected to be in developed markets with a high prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as North America and Europe. Demographically, their end-patients are individuals suffering from these chronic metabolic conditions. Revenue is expected to come from sales of their medical device and potential licensing or sales of their drug, though the drug aspect is in earlier stages of development.

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk for Fractyl Health is the regulatory approval process for their Revita DMR device. If the device does not receive approval from regulatory bodies like the FDA, it would significantly halt their revenue generation plans. Another near-term risk is the success of their ongoing clinical trials; poor trial results could jeopardize both the device and drug development. Long-term risks include competition from other companies developing similar therapies for MASLD and type 2 diabetes. If other treatments prove more effective, safer, or less expensive, Fractyl Health could lose market share. There's also the risk of reimbursement challenges; even with approval, if insurance companies are unwilling to cover the cost of their treatments, adoption by healthcare providers will be limited. Historically, the field of metabolic disease treatment has seen many promising therapies fail in late-stage trials or face significant hurdles in patient access, suggesting that these risks are persistent and require careful management.

## Company History

**Fractyl Health, Inc.: A Journey from Innovation to Metabolic Disease Solutions**

Fractyl Health, Inc., formerly known as Fractyl Laboratories, was founded in 2010 by Harith Rajagopalan, M.D., Ph.D., and Jay Caplan. The company's inception stemmed from a desire to move beyond merely managing the symptoms of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity, and instead, to address their fundamental, organ-level root causes. Dr. Rajagopalan, an academic cardiologist and physician-scientist, recognized that the gut's central role in metabolism had been largely overlooked, and that metabolic diseases might be rooted in intestinal dysfunction.

**The Genesis of Innovation: Revita and Rejuva**

Fractyl Health's core innovation lies in two main platforms:

1.  **Revita:** This is an outpatient endoscopic procedure that reshapes the lining of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The theory is that this mucosal lining can become thickened and dysfunctional due to modern diets, interfering with the gut's ability to regulate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. By resurfacing this lining, Revita aims to rejuvenate the duodenum and reverse insulin resistance, thereby addressing a root cause of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The Revita device received CE marking in Europe in 2016 and became commercially available in the UK in 2020. It has also received breakthrough device designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating type 2 diabetes and, more recently, for weight maintenance in individuals with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

2.  **Rejuva:** This is a gene therapy platform in preclinical development. It uses a gene-editing approach to enable the pancreas to produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on an ongoing basis. GLP-1 is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar and appetite. Rejuva aims to provide a durable, endogenous source of GLP-1, potentially offering a long-term treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The platform began its first-in-human studies in the first half of 2025.
