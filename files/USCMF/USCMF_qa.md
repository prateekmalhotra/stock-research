## Business Summary

US Critical Metals Corp. is an exploration company focused on finding and proving significant deposits of vital metals, such as lithium and rare earth elements, exclusively within the United States. The company operates as a junior explorer, meaning its core business is not yet mining. Instead, it acquires land rights and invests heavily in scientific testing and drilling to determine the quantity and quality of underground resources. If successful, the company aims to sell the developed project or the entire company to a much larger mining corporation that has the massive capital required to build an operational mine. Their eventual customers would be major industrial manufacturers, battery producers, and defense contractors seeking a stable, domestic supply chain for these materials.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is geological failure, which is common in exploration. The company spends substantial capital searching for resources, and if testing confirms the metals are insufficient or too expensive to extract, that investment is totally lost, severely harming earnings. Since the company does not generate operating revenue, it constantly needs to raise money from investors (financing risk); if the market becomes unwilling to fund them, their work stops. A major long-term threat involves the complex regulatory environment in the U.S. Obtaining the necessary environmental permits and government approvals to start a mine can take many years, and environmental opposition has frequently caused indefinite delays or canceled past mining projects, harming a company’s market position and valuation. Additionally, if the market prices for critical metals decline before the company proves its asset, the project may become commercially unviable.

### **History of US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF): From Inception to Present**

#### **The Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Founding and Early Identity:** The company, originally known as Holly Street Capital, was founded in 2019.
2.  **The Core Mission:** The business was established with a clear goal: to acquire, explore, and evaluate mineral deposits in the United States. This focus was driven by a larger strategic mission to secure a domestic supply of "critical minerals."
3.  **Why the Business Was Founded (The Driving Need):** The primary reason for US Critical Metals' existence is the growing national concern over foreign control of the critical mineral supply chain, particularly from countries like China. These minerals—like lithium, rare earth elements, and cobalt—are essential for national defense, high-tech manufacturing, and the global shift to clean energy technologies like electric vehicles.
4.  **The Ultimate Goal:** The company's goal is to reduce America's reliance on foreign sources by building a diversified portfolio of critical mineral projects located entirely within the US.

#### **Early Growth and Strategic Solutions**

5.  **Initial Strategy (The Innovative Solution):** Instead of focusing on one metal, US Critical Metals adopted a strategy of quickly acquiring rights to multiple "discovery-focused" exploration projects across key US mining states like Nevada, Idaho, and Montana. This diversification helped manage the risk inherent in mineral exploration.
6.  **Building the Portfolio (2021-2022 Milestones):** The company executed key agreements to build its project pipeline. For example, in 2021, it acquired the option for the **Clayton Ridge Lithium Property** in Nevada. In 2022, it entered agreements to invest in the **Sheep Creek** and **Lemhi Pass Rare Earth Projects** in Montana and Idaho.
7.  **Key Assets:** Today, the company's portfolio is strategically spread across various critical metals, including lithium (McDermitt, Clayton Ridge), rare earth elements (Sheep Creek, Lemhi Pass), cobalt (Haynes), and uranium/vanadium (Long Canyon).

#### **Tailwinds: The Fortunate Market Environment**

8.  **Government Support:** US Critical Metals has benefited from significant political and economic tailwinds in the US. There is strong, largely bipartisan, support for increasing domestic critical mineral production.
9.  **National Security Focus:** The US government has declared the lack of a secure critical metals supply as a national security concern. This has led to programs and policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provide incentives and financial support for companies developing minerals in the US.
10. **The Energy Transition Boom:** The massive global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy is a major tailwind. These technologies require vast amounts of lithium, cobalt, and rare earth magnets, which ensures a strong, long-term demand for the company's target minerals.

#### **Headwinds and Problems Faced**

11. **The Cost of Exploration (The Main Problem):** As an exploration-stage company, US Critical Metals is not yet mining or selling minerals, which means it has no revenue. A major challenge is continuously raising new funds to pay for the expensive, time-consuming work of drilling, sampling, and geological analysis needed to prove a project is valuable.
12. **The Long Path to Production:** Moving a mineral discovery from an initial claim to an operating mine is a decade-long process filled with scientific, financial, and regulatory hurdles. The company must constantly work to maintain investor confidence while navigating this lengthy development timeline.
13. **Regulatory and Permitting Challenges:** Even with government support, obtaining the necessary environmental and operational permits from agencies like the US Forest Service can be a slow and difficult process, which delays their work.
14. **How They Deal With Headwinds:** To counter the funding challenge, the company manages a tight financing structure and leverages the interest generated by the strong national demand for its metals to attract investors. They employ a methodical, expert-driven approach to exploration, using advanced techniques to make the best use of their exploration capital.

## Moat Analysis

The analysis of US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF) must be understood in the context that it is an **exploration and development-stage company**, meaning its moat is built around the quality of its undeveloped assets, its strategic location, and its technology partnerships, rather than current sales or market share. The company has a diverse portfolio of domestic U.S. projects for critical minerals like rare earth elements, lithium, and cobalt.

### Moat and Differentiation from Competitors

1.  **High-Grade, Low-Thorium Rare Earth Asset:** The primary geological differentiation is the **Sheep Creek Rare Earth Project** in Montana. It is reported to have **high-grade rare earth elements**. Crucially, the ore has **low thorium content** (averaging 200ppm, below the 500ppm permitting threshold), which is a significant advantage over many other U.S. rare earth deposits, as it can simplify the complex and costly permitting and processing steps.
2.  **Diverse Portfolio of U.S. Critical Minerals:** Unlike some competitors that focus on a single commodity, USCMF holds a diversified portfolio of properties across lithium, cobalt, uranium, vanadium, and rare earths in U.S. states like Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. This commodity mix is unique and addresses the U.S. government's goal of securing a domestic supply chain for multiple critical materials.
3.  **Process Innovation and R&D Partnership:** The company is actively working to create a "technological moat" by funding a **Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL)**. This is an explicit investment in research and development (R&D) to develop a pilot plant and **environmentally responsible, scalable separation processes** for its ore, which aims to provide a cleaner and more efficient processing method than existing techniques.
4.  **Strategic Government Alignment and Network Effects:** The partnership with INL, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) lab, and a strategic advisory alliance with **GreenMet** (a firm focused on critical minerals strategy and federal funding) are strong network advantages. This aligns the company with the national security agenda, potentially positioning it to secure government grants, loans, and other support for domestic critical mineral production.

### Pricing Power and Special Market Position

1.  **No Current Pricing Power:** As an exploration company that is not yet mining or producing, USCMF **does not currently have special pricing power**. Its market value is based on the *potential* of its undeveloped assets.
2.  **Special Position in the Market (Future Potential):** Its special position is that of a **"Made in the USA" critical mineral developer**. The entire company is positioned to capitalize on the geopolitical drive to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign sources (primarily China) for rare earth elements and other strategic materials essential for defense, EVs, and clean energy. This position acts as a powerful strategic leverage point.

### Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk

1.  **Reason for Growth:** The company grew into what it is today by **aggressively acquiring prospective U.S. properties** for critical metals at a time when global demand and U.S. government interest in domestic supply chains were surging. The potential of high-grade assets like Sheep Creek, combined with the strategic focus on U.S. security interests, is the core reason for its valuation and capital-raising ability.
2.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** The company is currently **vulnerable to displacement** or acquisition by a competitor with more capital due to its small market capitalization and negative cash flow typical of a junior explorer. A larger, well-funded mining company could easily acquire a more advanced project or even launch a takeover bid for USCMF to gain immediate access to its valuable U.S. properties and INL partnership.

### Customer Stickiness and Moat-Building Actions

1.  **Customer/Contracts are Not Yet Established:** The company is not in the production phase, so its contracts are primarily for acquiring and exploring properties. There are **no sticky, recurring customer off-take agreements** for its products yet, but the company's stated strategy is to *negotiate* forward off-take agreements to secure long-term demand and potential end-user investments.
2.  **Actions to Ensure a Solid Moat:** The company is building its future moat by:
    *   **Technological Innovation:** Partnering with INL to develop proprietary, low-environmental-impact processing technology, which could become a significant cost advantage and intellectual property moat if successful.
    *   **Asset Quality:** Securing and advancing the **low-thorium, high-grade rare earth project**, which provides a foundational, non-replicable geological advantage.
    *   **Political Network:** Leveraging strategic alliances (like GreenMet) to actively seek federal funding and strategic alignment, turning a national security concern into a competitive advantage for the business.

## Catalyst Analysis

US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF) is an exploration company, meaning its stock price catalysts are tied to successful exploration results and strategic corporate milestones, rather than traditional revenue and earnings.

### Management Strategy and Near-Term Catalysts

Management's strategy is to acquire and advance a diversified portfolio of US-based critical mineral projects to secure a domestic supply chain and reduce US reliance on foreign sources, explicitly capitalizing on national security and energy transition tailwinds.

**Near-Term Catalysts (Expected to impact price in the coming months):**

1.  **Upcoming Drill Program Results:** Positive results from the planned maiden drill program at the **McDermitt East Lithium Project** would significantly increase investor interest and project value.
2.  **Long Canyon Exploration Success:** Further exploration and development announcements following the recent confirmation of strong uranium-vanadium and polymetallic grades at the **Long Canyon Project** in Idaho could be a catalyst.
3.  **Project Consolidation:** The recent closing of the transaction to acquire **100% of the McDermitt East Lithium Project** provides full control and streamlines future development decisions for one of its key lithium assets.
4.  **Strategic Financing/Grants:** Management is actively seeking funding options, including strategic equity investments and federal grants, and securing such a non-dilutive grant or partnership would de-risk the company's financial position.

### Long-Term Catalysts

**Long-Term Catalysts (Expected to impact price over the next year and beyond):**

1.  **Rare Earth Processing Pilot Plant:** A major catalyst is the development of a pilot-scale processing facility for the **Sheep Creek Rare Earth Project** in partnership with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), which aims to create a clean, scalable method for separating rare earths and gallium.
2.  **Offtake Agreements:** Securing a forward off-take agreement (a long-term contract to sell future production) with a major end-user in the automotive, defense, or tech sectors would validate the economic potential of a project.
3.  **Resource Delineation:** Defining a formal mineral resource estimate for a key project (Lithium, Rare Earth, or Cobalt) would transition the project from a discovery to a quantified asset, which often leads to a significant increase in valuation.
4.  **US Government Support:** The company is strategically positioned to benefit from US government policy, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, which encourages domestic critical mineral production through potential grants, tax credits, and streamlined permitting.
5.  **Cobalt Supply Chain Focus:** The **Haynes Cobalt Project** remains a strategic asset, as management is focused on providing domestic supply of cobalt, an essential mineral for US defense and technology applications, given the current lack of US production.

*   **Insider Ownership:** Management and founding insiders hold significant equity, owning well over 40% of the company's stock as of late 2022, with CEO Darren Collins directly holding approximately 7.91% of the shares. This indicates strong alignment with shareholder interests.

#### **2. History, Key Decisions, and Shareholder Value Delivery**

*   **Financing and Capital Management:** CEO Collins has a track record of supporting and leading fundraising efforts that have collectively raised over $250 million in equity capital across his career. Since his appointment, the company completed a C$6 million financing (March 2022) that provided capital for its initial exploration work.
*   **Key Portfolio Acquisitions:** Management has actively executed on its strategy by acquiring and consolidating a portfolio of US-based assets, including the acquisition of a 70% interest in the Long Canyon Uranium and Vanadium Project (Dec 2022) and working to consolidate 100% of the McDermitt East Lithium Project.
*   **Exploration Milestones:** A key initial promise was advancing assets to "drill-ready" status, which was achieved in 2022. In 2023, the company completed a 1,500-meter drilling program at the flagship Clayton Ridge Lithium asset, and subsequent programs have been announced and completed on other projects like Long Canyon.
*   **Corporate Actions:** The company has also announced a 2.5:1 share consolidation (March 2025, *note: date may be a forward-looking convention in the source*) to potentially streamline its share structure.

#### **3. Future Strategy and Vision**

*   **Core Vision:** The central strategy is to create value through **discovery** by developing a diversified portfolio of critical metals projects—specifically Lithium, Rare Earth Elements (REE), Cobalt, and Uranium—in favorable US mining jurisdictions (Nevada, Montana, Idaho).
*   **Geopolitical Alignment:** The vision is explicitly focused on addressing the **US security of supply** for critical minerals, which strategically positions the company to benefit from US government initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the country's push for domestic mineral independence.
*   **Value Creation Optionality:** Management views the diverse portfolio as providing "optionality" to create shareholder value through various means, including funding and drilling the assets themselves, or spinning out/farming down projects to larger partners.
*   **Technical Focus:** The immediate future strategy is to advance current exploration to the point where they can identify and focus on a "core asset" that justifies the highest expenditure of capital.

#### **4. Performance and Investor Perception**

*   **Financial Health:** The company is an exploration-stage entity with a precarious financial situation, currently operating with negligible revenue and a serious cash burn rate, which means its continued existence is dependent on securing external funding and carries a high risk of future shareholder dilution.
*   **Stock Sentiment:** Investor sentiment is volatile, with the stock experiencing rapid rallies and drops, reflecting the high-risk, high-reward nature of early-stage exploration and a general market sensitivity to sector developments.
*   **CEO Compensation:** One potential investor concern noted is that the CEO's compensation has increased while the company remains unprofitable, though Collins has stated he is a shareholder working for equity and takes a "very reasonable monthly draw."

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available public information for US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF), a junior mining/exploration company, here is an evaluation of its management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Analysis of Management Incentives and Compensation for US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF)**

1.  **Insider Ownership is High:** The CEO, Darren Collins, holds a significant direct ownership stake of approximately **7.91%** of the company's shares, valued at over CA$910,000. This high level of personal equity investment suggests the CEO's financial interests are strongly tied to the long-term appreciation of the share price, which aligns him with the interests of other shareholders.

2.  **Compensation is Highly Dependent on Equity:** The capital structure includes 22.8 million outstanding options, warrants, and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) compared to 30.3 million basic common shares. This heavy use of equity-based compensation ensures that a substantial portion of the management team’s potential wealth is directly dependent on an increase in the company's share price.

3.  **Fixed Compensation is Relatively Modest for a Public Company:** The CEO's total compensation is reported to be CA$202,290. This relatively modest fixed compensation package, when viewed alongside the large equity component, suggests the primary financial reward is intended to be the growth in share value, rather than a high salary.

4.  **Compensation vs. Company Performance:** The CEO's compensation has reportedly increased while the company remains unprofitable. This would be a red flag for a mature company, but for an exploration-stage company—which US Critical Metals is, focused on acquiring and developing mineral properties—unprofitability is expected and typical of the industry life cycle.

5.  **Conclusion on Management Incentive:** The management team has **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**. The combination of **high insider ownership (7.91%)** and a compensation structure **heavily weighted towards equity grants** means that the executives will only see substantial financial gain if the company's long-term share price increases. While a lack of profitability tie-in to the short-term compensation exists, this is mitigated by the company's exploration-stage nature, where asset development and resource discovery—which drive long-term share price—are the main objectives.

The current price of \$0.215 represents a drop of about 69.6% from the 52-week high, suggesting a significant correction or retracement from earlier highs.

3.  **Technical Analysis and Trading Low:** Technical analysis presents a mixed picture, suggesting the stock may not be trading at a definitive "low" but is in a volatile phase. Some analysis shows overall **sell signals** from short and long-term Moving Averages, but also a **buy signal** from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

4.  **Technical Rating:** The technical rating is volatile; some providers indicate a **"neutral"** overall rating, yet note that a "buy" trend was prevailing on the 1-week and 1-month ratings. One system holds a "negative evaluation" for the stock in the short-term, but another forecasts a positive long-term trend, calling it an "awesome long-term (1-year) investment".

5.  **Recent Stock Price Volatility (Big Drops and Gains):** The stock has experienced extreme volatility in the last few months, including days with double-digit percentage swings. A sell signal in mid-October 2025 led to a sharp drop of over 52% from a pivot top, indicating a significant and sudden correction from its previous rally.

6.  **Reasons for Significant Price Movement:** The large gains and drops are primarily driven by news related to its projects and sector-wide sentiment. Positive developments include the acquisition of a 100% interest in the **McDermitt East Lithium Project** and confirmation of strong **Uranium-Vanadium grades** at the Long Canyon project.

7.  **Sector and Government Interest:** Investor optimism has been fueled by momentum in the critical minerals sector, increased attention from the U.S. government on domestic supply chains, and the expectation of federal funding or strategic interest in U.S. supply projects. A planned share consolidation was also noted as a potential positive for improving the capital structure.

## Long Thesis

US Critical Metals holds key US land rich in the vital materials (like Lithium and Rare Earths) needed for electric vehicles, green energy, and national defense. The core bull case is that this company is perfectly aligned with the US government’s urgent need to secure its domestic supply chain. In the near term, successful drilling will prove its deposits are valuable, attracting government grants and private investment. In the long term, these certified, domestic assets will become irreplaceable strategic properties, leading to a high-premium acquisition (a buyout) by a major mining company or battery producer desperate to guarantee a US-made supply, resulting in massive returns for initial investors.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The underlying assumption is that the company’s scientific testing will confirm large, high-quality metal deposits that can be extracted economically. We must also assume that the US government maintains its strong financial and political support for domestic critical minerals (via acts like the IRA), and that this support helps the company navigate complex, lengthy environmental permitting. Finally, the company must successfully raise the necessary capital to continue its exploration work without severely diluting current shareholder value before a major asset discovery is made.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key holes and faults in the long thesis for US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF) and forms the basis for a bear case.

### Critique and Identified Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Unproven Economics of the Core Assets:** The thesis assumes that "successful drilling will prove its deposits are valuable." However, the company is still in the early-stage exploration phase, and initial results (e.g., lithium grades up to 973 ppm or 2,129 ppm at their Nevada projects) do not constitute a commercially proven, *economically extractable* resource. The assets are not yet "certified" or "irreplaceable strategic properties" but rather speculative claims.
2.  **High Risk of Severe Shareholder Dilution:** The bull case assumes the company can "successfully raise the necessary capital... without severely diluting current shareholder value." In reality, the company is a micro-cap explorer that has recently resorted to a **2.5-for-1 share consolidation** and is actively seeking funding through **private placements**. This constant need for capital, combined with a low share price, makes severe dilution for existing shareholders an inherent, and very present, risk.
3.  **Permitting and Regulatory Bottlenecks are Understated:** The thesis relies on strong government support to "help the company navigate complex, lengthy environmental permitting." However, the U.S. permitting process is famously slow, often taking **5 to 10 years** for a lithium mine, regardless of supportive legislation like the IRA. The process is highly susceptible to **litigation and community/Tribal opposition**, which has delayed or killed major projects even with significant government backing, making the timeline highly uncertain.
4.  **Speculative "High-Premium Acquisition" Target:** The ultimate goal of a "high-premium acquisition (a buyout)" is purely speculative. Without a published, confirmed **Maiden Resource Estimate** and a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), the properties are just early-stage land claims, and a major mining company would be acquiring high-risk exploration assets, not a guaranteed supply chain.
5.  **Commodity & Project Diversification Risk:** While having multiple projects (Lithium, REE, Cobalt, Uranium/Vanadium) offers optionality, it also fragments the company's limited capital and management focus across various complex, multi-year exploration and development programs. This lack of focus could delay the single, massive discovery needed to validate the bull case.

***

### Bear Case Thesis for US Critical Metals Corp. (USCMF)

US Critical Metals Corp. is a highly speculative, capital-intensive exploration company that is over-reliant on favorable geopolitical policy while being fundamentally constrained by project economics and American regulatory hurdles.

1.  **Capital Crunch & Value Destruction:** The company's small market cap and constant need for funding from private placements and debt will lead to **persistent and severe dilution** of existing shareholders. The recent share consolidation is a red flag indicating a low stock price and financing strain, not a sign of imminent success. Without a major, certified resource, the company is on an unsustainable path of continuously issuing discounted shares to fund basic exploration.
2.  **The "Permitting Trap":** The favorable political tailwind from the IRA is practically nullified by the **protracted, litigious, and uncertain U.S. permitting environment**. Even if a high-quality deposit is confirmed, the decade-long regulatory process, compounded by potential legal challenges and Indigenous opposition (as seen with comparable projects), means the properties are unlikely to enter production or be ready for an acquisition in a timely manner.
3.  **Exploration Assets, Not Strategic Assets:** The company’s deposits are currently high-risk exploration projects, not "irreplaceable strategic properties." The initial drilling results are promising but fall short of proving a world-class, **economically viable** deposit, particularly in the complex claystone lithium and diversified metals space. A major mining company or battery producer will not pay a "high-premium acquisition" for unproven resources, forcing the company to continue the multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar path of proving the assets themselves.
4.  **Commodity Price Risk:** Any sustained downturn in the price of key commodities (Lithium, Rare Earths, Cobalt) during the long, inevitable delay in permitting and resource certification would make the projects immediately uneconomical, cause investor sentiment to sour, and further complicate capital raises, potentially leading to a sharp drop in share price.

---

## Next Steps

The initial analysis is comprehensive, and the first set of web searches has clarified several key unknowns, particularly around the core catalysts and financing risks.

### **Key Findings from Web Search:**

*   **Drill Results/Project Updates:** The high-grade sample results of up to 2,129 ppm lithium at **McDermitt East** are confirmed, and the company has closed the transaction to acquire **100%** of the project as of October 30, 2025. This de-risks ownership but does not replace a formal drill campaign or resource estimate. The Long Canyon project also confirmed strong uranium-vanadium grades in September 2025.
*   **INL Partnership (Moat):** A **Phase II Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)** with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) was announced in June 2025 to build a **pilot-scale processing plant** on the INL campus. The plant will process 1-2 tons of high-grade Sheep Creek ore per day. This confirms progress on the technological moat.
*   **Financing/Dilution:** The company is severely under-capitalized with **~ $77K - $80K in cash** and a negative operating cash flow (burn rate). The **reverse stock split (1:2.5 ratio)** was executed on March 25, 2025, which explains the new number of shares outstanding (currently around 21.5M - 35M depending on the reporting date, and a very low market cap of $7.5M - $8.85M). This confirms the bear case's emphasis on high dilution risk and capital strain.

### **Next Steps to Investigate (Unanswered Questions)**

The next phase of investigation should focus on turning the *potential* of the assets into *quantifiable risk* and checking for imminent financing events.

1.  **Imminent Funding Source and Cash Runway:**
    *   **Question:** Given the cash balance of less than $100K and negative cash flow, how long is the company's financial runway?
    *   **Action:** Search for news or SEC/CSE filings related to a **new Private Placement, Equity Raise, Debt Financing, or Grant Announcements** *since* the end of the last reported quarter (June 30, 2025) to understand the current financial stress and potential for immediate dilution.

2.  **Maiden Drill Program Status (McDermitt East):**
    *   **Question:** The company confirmed the acquisition and high-grade *samples*, but has it released results from the *planned drill program* or published a formal 43-101 Technical Report on the lithium asset?
    *   **Action:** Conduct a targeted search for **"US Critical Metals McDermitt East first drill hole results"** or **"US Critical Metals McDermitt East 43-101"** to find the most critical de-risking catalyst.

3.  **Specific Progress on INL Pilot Plant (Timeline & Funding):**
    *   **Question:** The Phase II CRADA was announced, but what is the current construction status and specific timeline for the pilot plant to begin processing the ore? Is the company still relying on R&D funds, or has it applied for/received any large **DOE/IRA grants** (e.g., from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law)?
    *   **Action:** Search for **"US Critical Metals INL pilot plant construction timeline"** or **"US Critical Metals DOE grant funding"** to validate the key technological moat.

4.  **Forward-Looking Project Prioritization:**
    *   **Question:** With a fragmented portfolio (Lithium, REE, Cobalt, U-V) and limited cash, which project (Sheep Creek, McDermitt, Long Canyon, or Haynes) is currently receiving the majority of the capital and management focus, and are any being considered for **farm-out agreements** or sale to preserve cash?
    *   **Action:** Review the *most recent* (Q3/Q4 2025) corporate presentations or CEO interviews for explicit statements on capital allocation and strategic asset focus.
