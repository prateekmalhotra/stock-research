# 2. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projections

Dine Brands Global is a highly franchised business, with its main revenue streams coming from franchise royalties and rental income for its Applebee's and IHOP brands. The business engine is driven primarily by:
1.  **Same-Restaurant Sales (Comp Sales):** Revenue from existing restaurants.
2.  **Net New Restaurant Development:** New restaurant openings net of closures.
3.  **Company Restaurant Sales:** Revenue from a small number of company-owned restaurants, recently increasing due to the take-back of 47 Applebee's in Q4 2024.

**Management Commentary and Trends:**
*   **FY 2024 Performance:** Total revenues decreased by 2.3% year-over-year. Comp sales were negative across both brands for the full year (IHOP: -2.0%, Applebee's: -4.2%) due to macro headwinds impacting consumer spending.
*   **Q3 2025 Trends:** Consolidated total revenue saw a 10.8% increase, but this was *primarily* driven by an increase in company restaurant sales (from the Applebee's take-back), which masked a decrease of 3% in franchise revenues. IHOP comp sales remained negative at -1.5%. Off-premise sales remain a bright spot with a positive 9% lift in Q3 2025.
*   **Future Strategy:** The company plans to continue its highly franchised model and aims to refranchise company-operated restaurants under favorable conditions.

**Conservative Revenue Assumptions (2025-2030):**

Given the recent negative same-store sales trend and the company's exposure to discretionary consumer spending, a very conservative growth model is warranted. The primary growth driver will be minimal net unit development and a slow recovery in comps.

| Year | Assumption/Justification for Growth | Projected Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual)** | Base Year | - | \$812.3 |
| **2025 (Initial Recovery)** | Assumes a modest full-year impact from the 2024 Applebee's take-back and a stabilization/small comp decline. Net unit growth is near zero. | 1.5% | \$824.5 |
| **2026** | Assumes same-store sales stabilize to flat (0.0%), and net new unit growth provides a minimal lift. | 1.0% | \$832.7 |
| **2027** | Assumes modest growth from small net unit development and a slight positive comp sale increase (0.5%). | 1.5% | \$845.2 |
| **2028** | Assumes the franchise model returns to its normalized, low-growth state. Comp sales of 1.0% and minimal net unit growth. | 1.8% | \$860.4 |
| **2029** | Stable, conservative low-single-digit growth. | 2.0% | \$877.6 |
| **2030** | Stable, conservative low-single-digit growth. | 2.0% | \$895.2 |

# 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

**Margin Assumption:**

*   **FY 2024 Net Margin:** 8.0%.
*   **Conservative Projection:** Given the pressure on franchise revenue and higher commodity costs cited in the Q3 2025 earnings call (IHOP costs up 5.7%), a conservative approach is to project a slight degradation in margin due to macroeconomic pressures and G&A expense increases seen in Q3 2025. However, due to the highly franchised/asset-light nature of the business, margins are inherently stable and high. I will project a **conservative Net Margin of 7.5%** for all projected years to account for a sustained, mature, but pressured operating environment.

**Net Income Calculation with ROIC:**

The rule states: $\text{Net Income}_y = \text{Base Net Income}_y + \text{ROIC} \times \text{Retained Cash}_{y-1}$.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** The historical ROIC is 7.72%. Given the asset-light, highly franchised nature, a positive ROIC is reasonable. I will use a **conservative ROIC of 5.0%** to project the return on retained earnings, which is below the historic proxy.
*   **Retained Cash:** Dine Brands is committed to its dividend. The dividend per share in FY 2024 was \$2.04.
    *   $\text{Dividends Paid in FY 2024} = \$2.04 \times 15.0 \text{ million shares} = \$30.6 \text{ million}$.
    *   $\text{Retained Cash} = \text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends}$.
    *   I will assume this dividend policy continues, so *Retained Cash* for future years will be: $\text{Net Income}_y - \$30.6 \text{ million}$.

| Year | Projected Revenue (\$M) | Net Margin | Base Net Income (\$M) | Retained Cash (from previous year) (\$M) | ROIC (5.0%) Income (\$M) | Projected Net Income (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | \$812.3 | 8.0% | \$64.9 | - | - | \$64.9 |
| **2025** | \$824.5 | 7.5% | \$61.8 | \$34.3* | \$1.7 | **\$63.5** |
| **2026** | \$832.7 | 7.5% | \$62.5 | \$63.5 | \$3.2 | **\$65.7** |
| **2027** | \$845.2 | 7.5% | \$63.4 | \$98.6 | \$4.9 | **\$68.3** |
| **2028** | \$860.4 | 7.5% | \$64.5 | \$136.0 | \$6.8 | **\$71.3** |
| **2029** | \$877.6 | 7.5% | \$65.8 | \$176.7 | \$8.8 | **\$74.6** |
| **2030** | \$895.2 | 7.5% | \$67.1 | \$220.7 | \$11.0 | **\$78.1** |

*\* Retained Cash from 2024: \$64.9M (FY 2024 NI) - \$30.6M (Dividends) = \$34.3M. Retained Cash for subsequent years is the previous year's Retained Cash + the Net Income from that year less the \$30.6M dividend.*

# 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** The business is mature but faces significant industry headwinds and has a high leverage structure. A conservative discount rate (proxy for WACC) of **10.0%** is used.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth Rate):** Given the very low, recent negative comp sales, a very conservative long-term growth rate of **1.0%** is assumed for the terminal period, reflecting growth just above the rate of inflation.

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

The *Projected Net Income* is used as the cash flow proxy.

| Year | Projected Net Income (CF) (\$M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$63.5 | 0.909 | \$57.7 |
| **2026** | \$65.7 | 0.826 | \$54.3 |
| **2027** | \$68.3 | 0.751 | \$51.3 |
| **2028** | \$71.3 | 0.683 | \$48.7 |
| **2029** | \$74.6 | 0.621 | \$46.3 |
| **2030** | \$78.1 | 0.564 | \$44.1 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | - | - | **\$302.4** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (as of End of 2030):**

*   $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate}) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$
*   $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \$78.1 \text{M} \times (1 + 0.01) / (0.10 - 0.01)$
*   $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \$78.9 \text{M} / 0.09 = \$876.7 \text{ million}$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

*   $\text{NPV of TV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   $\text{NPV of TV} = \$876.7 \text{M} \times 0.564 = **\$494.3 \text{ million}$**

**Total Net Present Value (Total Equity Value Proxy):**

*   $\text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
*   $\text{Total NPV} = \$302.4 \text{M} + \$494.3 \text{M} = **\$796.7 \text{ million}$**

# 5. Fair Value Calculation

The final step is to calculate the fair value per share using the Adjusted Net Present Value:

$$\text{Fair Value} = \frac{(\text{Total NPV} + \text{Current Cash}) - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

| Metric | Value (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV (Equity Value Proxy) | \$796.7 |
| PLUS: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$186.7 |
| LESS: Total Debt | \$1,100.0 |
| **Implied Equity Value (Numerator)** | **-\$116.6 million** |

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{-\$116.6 \text{ million}}{15.0 \text{ million shares}} = **-\$7.77 \text{ per share}$$**

---

# 6. Conclusion and Justification

## Final Fair Value

Based on this conservative DCF model, the calculated Fair Value of Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN) stock is **\$0.00 per share**. (The mathematical result is negative, which implies the firm's debt and liabilities outweigh the discounted value of its future cash flows and current cash holdings.)

## Justification for Discrepancy

**Current Stock Price:** \$31.73
**Calculated Fair Value:** \$0.00 (as a floor for the negative value)

There is a massive discrepancy, with the market valuing the stock significantly higher than this intrinsic valuation suggests.

The core reason for the negative equity valuation is the company's **highly leveraged balance sheet** combined with a conservative forecast for future cash flow.

| Factor | Model Value | Market Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Debt** | \$1.1 Billion | The same, but with different assumptions on its *risk* and *repayment*. | DIN is a highly-leveraged franchise/royalty business. My model views the debt as a direct liability against future cash flow. The market likely views this debt as **Non-Recourse Securitized Debt** that is tied to the royalty streams, effectively making the equity an option on a highly leveraged cash flow stream, rather than a traditional corporate balance sheet where the equity holders bear the full risk of the entire debt. The market is pricing the equity based on the cash flow *after* debt service, not just the raw subtraction of debt from enterprise value. |
| **Terminal Growth** | 1.0% | Likely 2.0% - 3.0%+ | My assumption is based on the recent negative same-store sales and a cautious view of the long-term mature brand prospects. The market is likely assuming a successful turnaround, a return to 1.0% - 2.0% *positive* comps, and continued international/dual-brand development, leading to a much higher perpetual growth rate for the royalty stream. |
| **Discount Rate** | 10.0% | Likely 7.0% - 8.0% | My 10.0% discount rate is conservative due to high debt and recent poor performance. The market may use a lower WACC, reflecting the stable, royalty-driven nature of the cash flow, which is less volatile than a company-operated restaurant model, thus increasing the NPV. |

**Market's Underlying Assumptions:**

1.  **Debt Structure:** The market is likely valuing DIN as a **leveraged finance vehicle (Royalty Securitization)** where the debt is offset by the stable, high-margin, predictable royalty stream cash flow, and the *equity* is valued on the *excess free cash flow* after debt service. This business model supports a much higher debt-to-equity ratio than traditional companies.
2.  **Turnaround and Stability:** The market is discounting the recent negative comp sales trend and is assuming the management's efforts (off-premise growth, new restaurant designs) will successfully stabilize and modestly grow the brand's system-wide sales, leading to a much stronger Net Income stream than the 7.5% net margin used in this model.
3.  **Capital Allocation:** The market is rewarding the continued commitment to the dividend despite the negative trends, viewing it as a sign of management's confidence in long-term cash generation.

**Conclusion:**

The DCF model, using a very conservative projection for revenue growth and a high discount rate, fails to capture the unique highly-leveraged, asset-light, royalty-based financial structure of Dine Brands. While the negative intrinsic value is a strong warning about the high level of debt relative to the modest projected cash flows, the market is pricing in a **successful leverage-supported operation** where the predictability and longevity of the high-margin royalty cash flows (Applebee's and IHOP are legacy brands) is sufficient to service the debt and provide a stable, growing stream of excess cash flow to equity holders.
