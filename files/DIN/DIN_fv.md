### **Part 2: Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)**

Dine Brands operates as a highly-franchised model (Applebee's, IHOP, Fuzzy's Taco Shop), meaning revenue is primarily driven by:
1.  **Same-Restaurant Sales (Comp Sales):** Royalty revenue is a percentage of franchisee sales.
2.  **Net Unit Growth:** Increase in the total number of franchised restaurants.
3.  **Company Restaurant Operations:** A small portion, but a recent source of revenue growth due to acquisition/takeback of some restaurants.

#### **2025 Projection: Anchored by Management Guidance**

Management's guidance for 2025 provides the anchor for the first year:
*   **Adjusted EBITDA Guidance:** \$220 million to \$230 million. **Conservative Anchor: \$220.0 Million.**
*   **Revenue Growth:** Q2 2025 revenue was \$230.8 million. Full-year 2024 revenue was \$812.31 million.
    *   Comp sales guidance is mixed: Applebee's 1-3% (conservative **1.5%**), IHOP -1% to 1% (conservative **-0.5%**).
    *   Total revenue is expected to increase due to the company restaurant take-back, offset by weak franchise performance. We will assume the full-year 2025 revenue growth is a conservative **4.5%** over 2024 revenue to account for the company-owned restaurant sales (a non-core element) and the franchise revenue decline.

| Year | Revenue Calculation | Revenue (Millions) | Basis/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | $812.3$ | Reported 2024 Revenue |
| **2025 (Projected)** | $812.3 \times (1 + 4.5\%)$ | **$848.8$** | Conservative 4.5% growth over 2024, reflecting the net effect of mixed comp sales guidance and the company-owned restaurant acquisitions mentioned in Q2 2025. |
| **2026** | $848.8 \times (1 + 2.0\%)$ | **$865.8$** | Assumes gradual turnaround: 1.5% comp sales growth (franchise) + 0.5% net unit growth. |
| **2027** | $865.8 \times (1 + 2.5\%)$ | **$887.5$** | Assumes momentum builds: 2.0% comp sales + 0.5% net unit growth. |
| **2028** | $887.5 \times (1 + 2.5\%)$ | **$909.7$** | Sustained growth rate based on dual-brand traction and off-premise growth. |
| **2029** | $909.7 \times (1 + 2.5\%)$ | **$932.5$** | Sustained growth rate. |
| **2030** | $932.5 \times (1 + 2.5\%)$ | **$955.9$** | Sustained growth rate. |

### **Part 3: Net Income and ROIC Projection**

The transition from the high-margin franchise model to including more company-owned restaurants has led to margin pressure.

#### **A. Net Income Margin Determination**

1.  **2025 Net Income (Calculated from EBITDA Guidance):**
    *   Conservative Adjusted EBITDA: \$220.0 million
    *   **Interest Expense:** \$600.0 million Debt $\times$ 6.0% assumed interest rate (reflecting the higher rate from the Q2 2025 refinancing) = **\$36.0 million**
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** 2024 D&A was approximately \$25.0 million (Historical 10-K data). Assume **\$26.0 million** (slight increase due to CapEx/initiatives).
    *   **Pre-Tax Income (PBT):** \$220.0 - \$36.0 - \$26.0 = **\$158.0 million**
    *   **Tax Expense:** Use a conservative statutory rate of 25.0% (historical effective tax rate has varied)
    *   **Tax:** \$158.0 million $\times$ 25.0% = **\$39.5 million**
    *   **2025 Net Income (Initial):** \$158.0 - \$39.5 = **\$118.5 million**
    *   **2025 Net Income Margin (Initial):** \$118.5 / \$848.8 = **14.0%**

2.  **2026-2030 Net Income Margin:** Due to continued margin pressure and G&A expenses mentioned in the Q2 2025 earnings call, a conservative approach is a slight contraction and then stabilization.

| Year | Revenue (M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (M) (Initial) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $848.8$ | 14.0% | $118.5$ |
| **2026** | $865.8$ | 13.8% | $119.5$ |
| **2027** | $887.5$ | 13.6% | $120.7$ |
| **2028** | $909.7$ | 13.5% | $122.8$ |
| **2029** | $932.5$ | 13.4% | $124.9$ |
| **2030** | $955.9$ | 13.4% | $128.1$ |

#### **B. ROIC on Retained Earnings**

Per the prompt's rule, net income for the previous year is added to cash, and an additional income is earned from that cash at a 10.0% ROIC rate. We will assume 50% of net income is paid as a dividend (near the high historical rate to remain conservative for valuation) and 50% is retained.

| Year | Retained Net Income from Prior Year (M) | ROIC Income (M) @ 10.0% | Net Income (Final, M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$0.0 | \$0.0 | **$118.5$** |
| **2026** | $118.5 \times 50\% = 59.3$ | $59.3 \times 10.0\% = 5.9$ | **$125.4$** ($119.5 + 5.9$) |
| **2027** | $125.4 \times 50\% = 62.7$ | $62.7 \times 10.0\% = 6.3$ | **$127.0$** ($120.7 + 6.3$) |
| **2028** | $127.0 \times 50\% = 63.5$ | $63.5 \times 10.0\% = 6.4$ | **$129.2$** ($122.8 + 6.4$) |
| **2029** | $129.2 \times 50\% = 64.6$ | $64.6 \times 10.0\% = 6.5$ | **$131.4$** ($124.9 + 6.5$) |
| **2030** | $131.4 \times 50\% = 65.7$ | $65.7 \times 10.0\% = 6.6$ | **$134.7$** ($128.1 + 6.6$) |

### **Part 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The net income calculated above will be used as the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) since this highly-franchised, low-CAPEX model has minimal difference between Net Income and FCFE (given that CapEx is already accounted for via D&A and is typically low).

| Year | FCFE (Net Income, M) | Discount Factor @ 10.0% | Net Present Value (NPV, M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $118.5$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^1$ = 0.9091 | $107.7$ |
| **2026** | $125.4$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^2$ = 0.8264 | $103.6$ |
| **2027** | $127.0$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^3$ = 0.7513 | $95.4$ |
| **2028** | $129.2$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^4$ = 0.6830 | $88.3$ |
| **2029** | $131.4$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^5$ = 0.6209 | $81.6$ |
| **2030** | $134.7$ | $1 / (1 + 0.10)^6$ = 0.5645 | $76.0$ |
| **Sum of NPV of Projected FCFE** | | | **$552.6$** |

#### **Terminal Value Calculation (2030)**

The terminal value is the present value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$134.7 \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.10 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$137.4}{\text{0.08}} = \textbf{\$1,717.5 \text{ Million}}$$

#### **Terminal Value - Net Present Value (NPV)**

$$\text{Terminal Value NPV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value NPV} = \$1,717.5 \text{ Million} \times 0.5645 = \textbf{\$969.8 \text{ Million}}$$

---

### **Part 5: Fair Value Calculation**

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV of Projected FCFE} + \text{Terminal Value NPV} + \text{Unrestricted Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$552.6 \text{ Million} + \$969.8 \text{ Million} + \$194.2 \text{ Million} - \$600.0 \text{ Million}$$

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \textbf{\$1,116.6 \text{ Million}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Total Diluted Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$1,116.6 \text{ Million}}{14.879 \text{ Million}} = \textbf{\$75.05}$$

---

### **Part 6: Conclusion and Justification**

**Calculated Fair Value per Share:** **\$75.05**
**Current Market Price per Share:** **\$26.88**

The calculated fair value of **\$75.05** is approximately **180% higher** than the current market price of **\$26.88**.

#### **Justification for the Discrepancy**

The large difference suggests the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Dine Brands' future cash flow and/or the inherent risk in the business.

| Valuation Assumption (Bullish to Market) | Market Assumption (Bearish) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Future Growth (2.5% Long-Term)** | Market assumes a long-term nominal growth rate closer to **0% to 1.0%** (i.e., minimal real growth). | The core business (Applebee's and IHOP) is mature and faces sustained negative/flat comparable sales growth, as seen in recent quarters. The market likely believes the dual-brand and off-premise initiatives will not be enough to drive meaningful growth above inflation. |
| **Discount Rate (10.0%)** | Market implies a much higher discount rate (e.g., **13-14%**). | A higher discount rate reflects a greater perceived risk, especially due to high debt (\$600 million) and a highly uncertain consumer environment, leading to "margin pressure" and "elevated operating costs". The market is penalizing the stock for its high financial leverage and business volatility. |
| **Net Income Margin (13.4% Stable)** | Market assumes continued, severe margin contraction, with Net Income Margin trending toward **8-10%**. | The decline in Adjusted EBITDA (Q2 2025 was \$56.2 million, down from \$67.0 million in Q2 2024) and rising G&A expenses are concrete data points suggesting a structural issue with profitability beyond the top line. The market is pricing in the *continuation* of this negative trend, whereas the valuation assumes a reasonable *stabilization* after 2027. |

The valuation is highly sensitive to the Discount Rate and the Terminal Growth Rate. The market is assigning a higher risk premium and a lower long-term growth expectation to Dine Brands due to the systemic issues in its two core, mature brands struggling to achieve positive sales/traffic in a challenging consumer environment, effectively pricing the company as a low-growth, high-risk asset.
