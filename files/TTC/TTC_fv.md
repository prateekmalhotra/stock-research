### 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2026-2030)

The Toro Company's business engine is dual-segmented: **Professional** (approx. 80% of net sales) and **Residential** (approx. 20% of net sales).

**Business Drivers & Assumptions:**

| Segment | Driver & Management Commentary | Conservative Assumption (CAGR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Professional** | Continued strong demand in **Golf & Grounds** and **Underground Construction**. Professional segment earnings margin reached 19.4% in FY2025. The business is resilient. | **4.0% CAGR** - Reflects sustained strong demand for essential commercial equipment and a conservative estimate below historical mid-single-digit growth. |
| **Residential** | Challenged by macroeconomic factors (high interest rates) and channel caution. Dealers are working to normalize field inventories, but the segment is positioned for improved performance as consumer confidence returns. | **1.0% CAGR** - Reflects a very conservative, slow recovery from the inventory headwinds and macro caution, aligning with management's commentary of a challenging near-term market. |
| **Total Net Sales (Blended)** | FY2026 net sales were expected to be down slightly in commentary, but the full-year FY2026 adjusted EPS guidance of **\$4.35-\$4.50** implies some top-line and margin growth. | A blended, weighted average growth rate that gradually increases as the residential market recovers. |

#### Revenue Projection Calculation

*   **FY2025 Revenue:** \$4,510.4 million
*   **Segment Weighting:** Professional (80%), Residential (20%)
*   **Blended Growth Rate (FY2026):** (80% \* 4.0%) + (20% \* 1.0%) = 3.2% + 0.2% = **3.4%**

| Year (Fiscal) | Professional Rev. (Growth %) | Residential Rev. (Growth %) | Total Net Sales (USD Millions) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025** | *N/A* | *N/A* | **\$4,510.4** |
| **2026** | 4.0% | 1.0% | **\$4,663.7** |
| **2027** | 4.0% | 2.0% | **\$4,821.5** |
| **2028** | 4.0% | 3.0% | **\$4,984.7** |
| **2029** | 3.5% | 3.5% | **\$5,160.8** |
| **2030** | 3.0% | 3.0% | **\$5,315.6** |

**Justification for Projections:** The growth profile is front-loaded to the strength of the Professional segment, with a slow, gradual recovery in the Residential segment's contribution (moving from 1.0% to 3.0% growth). The blended growth rate decelerates slightly by 2030 to reflect a conservative long-term outlook, avoiding an overly optimistic perpetual growth assumption.

### 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

#### Margin Projections
Management has provided explicit margin guidance for FY2026, which is crucial for determining net income. The company is also executing its **AMP initiative** with a run-rate savings target of **\$125 million by 2027**.

| Metric | FY2025 Actual | FY2026-FY2030 Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin % (GM)** | 33.4% | **34.5%** (2026) -> **35.5%** (2030) | Gradual expansion from FY2025 due to net price realization, product mix, and benefits from the AMP productivity improvements, especially the increased savings target. |
| **SG&A as % of Net Sales** | Approx. 22.5%* | **21.5%** (2026) -> **20.5%** (2030) | Reflects operating leverage and the realization of the \$125 million AMP program savings. The cost base grows slower than revenue. |
| **Operating Margin %** | Approx. 11.8%* | **13.0%** (2026) -> **15.0%** (2030) | Calculated as GM - SG&A. This is a conservative-to-midpoint target in line with historical levels and management's focus on margin expansion. |
| **Interest Expense** | \$59.1M | **\$59.1M** (2026), declining 2% thereafter. | Kept flat for 2026 and then a slight, conservative decline, reflecting the relatively stable long-term debt. |
| **Tax Rate** | 16.3%** | **18.0%** | A conservative increase from the lower-than-average FY2025 rate (which benefited from certain tax items) to a more normalized rate. |

*\*Calculated from FY2025 financial table: Operating Earnings (\$409.9M) / Net Sales (\$4,510.4M) = 9.1%. This is GAAP. Adjusted operating margin was higher. Using the above component margins is a better forecast approach. SG&A is \$1,013.8M in FY2025. SG&A % is \$1,013.8M / \$4,510.4M = 22.5%.*
* *\*Tax Rate is Provision for Income Taxes (\$61.5M) / Earnings Before Income Taxes (\$377.6M) = 16.3% (GAAP).*

#### Cash Flow Calculation (Discounted Cash Flow Proxy: Net Income)
**Rule:** Net Income for the next year = (Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions) + (ROIC from net income got from previous year).

*   **ROIC Assumption:** I will use a conservative ROIC of **15%**. This is based on a conservative view of the company's historical performance (FY2025 FCF conversion was an exceptional 128%) and the need to project a sustained, high return from retained earnings.

| Year (Fiscal) | Net Sales (A) | Gross Margin % | SG&A % | Gross Profit (B) | SG&A (C) | Operating Income (D=B-C) | Interest Exp. (E) | PBT (F=D-E) | Tax Rate % | Tax (G) | **Net Income (H=F-G)** | Prior Year NI (I) | ROIC Return (J=I*15%) | **Final NI (H+J)** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025** | \$4,510.4 | 33.4% | 22.5% | \$1,504.8 | \$1,013.8 | \$409.9 | \$59.1 | \$350.8 | 16.3% | \$57.2 | **\$293.6** | N/A | N/A | **\$293.6** |
| **2026** | \$4,663.7 | 34.5% | 21.5% | \$1,609.0 | \$1,002.7 | \$531.6 | \$59.1 | \$472.5 | 18.0% | \$85.1 | **\$387.4** | \$293.6 | \$44.0 | **\$431.4** |
| **2027** | \$4,821.5 | 35.0% | 21.0% | \$1,687.5 | \$1,012.5 | \$603.9 | \$57.9 | \$546.0 | 18.0% | \$98.3 | **\$447.7** | \$431.4 | \$64.7 | **\$512.4** |
| **2028** | \$4,984.7 | 35.2% | 20.8% | \$1,754.6 | \$1,036.8 | \$649.8 | \$56.7 | \$593.1 | 18.0% | \$106.8 | **\$486.3** | \$512.4 | \$76.9 | **\$563.2** |
| **2029** | \$5,160.8 | 35.4% | 20.6% | \$1,827.0 | \$1,063.1 | \$685.1 | \$55.6 | \$629.5 | 18.0% | \$113.3 | **\$516.2** | \$563.2 | \$84.5 | **\$600.7** |
| **2030** | \$5,315.6 | 35.5% | 20.5% | \$1,887.8 | \$1,090.7 | \$711.4 | \$54.5 | \$656.9 | 18.0% | \$118.2 | **\$538.7** | \$600.7 | \$90.1 | **\$628.8** |

*Note: For the terminal value calculation, the Final Net Income for 2030 is used as the final year's cash flow.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable): 9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This represents a conservative estimate for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). It accounts for the company's maturity, low beta (typically stable industrials), and moderate debt level, while still providing a margin of safety above the expected long-term risk-free rate.
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (Very Conservative Maturity Rate): 2.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a very conservative assumption, well below the long-term global and US GDP growth rate, reflecting a mature company and a necessary margin of safety.

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (Fiscal) | Net Income (Cash Flow) (G) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2026** | \$431.4 | 0.9174 | \$395.7 |
| **2027** | \$512.4 | 0.8417 | \$431.3 |
| **2028** | \$563.2 | 0.7722 | \$434.9 |
| **2029** | \$600.7 | 0.7084 | \$425.6 |
| **2030** | \$628.8 | 0.6499 | \$408.7 |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
TV = [Cash Flow in 2030 \* (1 + Perpetual Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)
TV = [\$628.8 \* (1 + 0.02)] / (0.09 - 0.02)
TV = \$641.38 / 0.07
TV = \$9,162.6 million

**Terminal Value Present Value (PV of TV):**
PV of TV = TV \* Discount Factor for 2030
PV of TV = \$9,162.6 million \* 0.6499
PV of TV = **\$5,954.0 million**

**Total Net Present Value (Total NPV):**
Total NPV = Sum of PVs (2026-2030) + PV of TV
Total NPV = (\$395.7 + \$431.3 + \$434.9 + \$425.6 + \$408.7) + \$5,954.0
Total NPV = **\$8,050.2 million**

---

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value** = Total NPV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
Total Equity Value = \$8,050.2 million + \$341.0 million - \$921.5 million
Total Equity Value = **\$7,469.7 million**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$7,469.7 million / 99.8 million shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$74.85**

---

### 6. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$74.85** |
| **Current Stock Price (Hypothetical)** | *Assume a recent market price, e.g., \$85.00* |

#### Justification for Valuation Discrepancy

My calculated Fair Value of **\$74.85** is below the hypothetical current market value (e.g., \$85.00).

The market appears to be making a more optimistic assumption about the company's future performance, particularly on one or more of the following key assumptions:

1.  **Higher Revenue Growth:** The market likely forecasts a quicker and stronger recovery in the Residential segment and/or a higher long-term growth rate in the robust Professional segment. The market might be factoring in a normalized total company growth rate closer to **4.5% - 5.0%** post-2026, compared to my conservative 3.0%-4.0% projection.
2.  **Higher Terminal Value / Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower discount rate (e.g., 7.5%-8.0% WACC) to reflect a high-quality, stable business, or a higher perpetual growth rate (e.g., 3.0%-3.5%). A 3.0% perpetual growth rate at a 9.0% discount rate would increase the fair value to approximately \$88.40 per share.
3.  **Faster and More Substantial Margin Expansion:** While my model incorporates the AMP program savings, the market may expect the **\$125 million in savings** to translate even more aggressively into the Net Income line, resulting in higher operating margins faster than my gradual 13.0% to 15.0% expansion.

**My Case for the Conservative Valuation (\$74.85):**
My valuation is a **conservative** one, grounded in a highly scrutinized view of the business engine and management's current commentary:
*   **Residential Headwinds are Real:** Management explicitly noted that the Residential segment is "challenged by macro factors, including high interest rates." My low initial growth rate for this 20% portion of the business (1.0% in 2026) is a necessary, conservative reflection of this reality, which may take longer than expected to dissipate.
*   **Margin of Safety:** The use of a **9.0% discount rate** and a low **2.0% terminal growth rate** provides a strong margin of safety, reflecting the cyclicality inherent in the equipment manufacturing industry, despite the stability of the Professional segment.
*   **"Use management commentary as truth":** Management provided a solid guidance, but a forward projection to 2030 requires conservative assumptions beyond explicit guidance. The projected Net Income growth is healthy, but the valuation suggests the current market price is baking in a more aggressive, less conservative forecast. The market is betting on a stronger cyclical upturn in the next 3-5 years.
