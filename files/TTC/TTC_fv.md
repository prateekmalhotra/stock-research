## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (FY 2025 - FY 2030)

The Toro Company's business is fundamentally driven by its two segments: **Professional** (approx. 78% of 2024 sales) and **Residential** (approx. 22% of 2024 sales).

### Business Engine Assumptions

1.  **Professional Segment (The Growth Engine):** Driven by strong demand in underground construction and golf/grounds products, aided by net price realization and productivity improvements (AMP program). This segment is expected to continue its stable, profitable growth.
2.  **Residential Segment (The Headwind):** Currently facing significant pressure from weak homeowner demand and channel caution. This market is cyclically driven by housing, interest rates, and consumer confidence.
3.  **AMP Program:** Management is targeting at least **\$100 million in annualized savings by 2027**. This initiative is key to margin expansion, even if revenue growth is moderate.

### Revenue Projections

The projections are based on management's commentary and conservative long-term growth rates, with an expected normalization in the Residential segment after 2025.

| Year | Professional Segment (Net Sales in millions) | Residential Segment (Net Sales in millions) | Total Net Sales (in millions) | Y-o-Y Growth | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual Base)** | \$3,560.0 | \$998.3 | **\$4,558.3** | N/A | Calculated base year revenue |
| **FY 2025 (Guidance)** | \$3,595.6 (Up 1.0%) | \$848.6 (Down 15.0%) | **\$4,444.2** | **-2.5%** | Using the low-end of "flat to down 3%" guidance. Professional is "up slightly" (assumed 1.0%), and Residential is "down mid-teens" (assumed -15.0%). |
| **FY 2026** | \$3,775.4 (Up 5.0%) | \$891.0 (Up 5.0%) | **\$4,666.4** | **+5.0%** | Residential recovers slightly, and Professional maintains strong growth, leveraging backlog and underground construction momentum. |
| **FY 2027** | \$3,964.2 (Up 5.0%) | \$935.6 (Up 5.0%) | **\$4,899.8** | **+5.0%** | Continued Professional strength and Residential normalization. AMP savings fully realized. |
| **FY 2028** | \$4,162.4 (Up 5.0%) | \$972.0 (Up 4.0%) | **\$5,134.4** | **+4.8%** | Growth moderates slightly toward long-term GDP+ as a result of conservatism. |
| **FY 2029** | \$4,328.9 (Up 4.0%) | \$1,001.2 (Up 3.0%) | **\$5,330.1** | **+3.8%** | Conservative long-term growth rate. |
| **FY 2030** | \$4,468.8 (Up 3.2%) | \$1,021.2 (Up 2.0%) | **\$5,490.0** | **+3.0%** | Conservative long-term growth rate, settling at 3.0% which is a prudent estimate for a mature industrial company. |

## 3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

### Margin and Tax Assumptions

*   **FY 2024 Adjusted Operating Margin:** 12.2%.
*   **FY 2025 Net Income Margin:** Management expects adjusted operating margin to be flat to slightly lower. We will assume a 9.0% Net Income Margin for 2025, slightly down from FY2024 as the residential segment decline is margin-dilutive.
*   **Post-2025 Net Income Margin:** The AMP program is a key profitability driver. I will project an expansion in Net Income Margin, reaching **10.5% by FY 2027** to reflect the \$100M+ in annualized savings, and a stable **11.0%** margin from 2028 onwards.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Historical TTM ROIC is around 16.70% to 21.79%. For a conservative valuation, I will use a conservative **ROIC of 15.0%** to generate additional income from the net income cash flows.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable rate for a mature industrial company in the current economic environment. I will use a **Discount Rate of 9.0%**.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** A conservative perpetual growth rate well below global GDP growth. I will use a **Terminal Growth Rate of 2.0%**.

### DCF Calculation

The rule is: *Net Income (t) = Projected Net Income (t) + ROIC from Net Income cash-in (t-1)*.

| Year (FY) | Total Net Sales (A) | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income (B) (A x Margin) | Cash Inflow from Prior Year (C) | ROIC (15.0%) | Additional Income (D) (C x ROIC) | Net Income for DCF (E) (B + D) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) (E x Factor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | \$4,444.2 | 9.0% | \$400.0 | N/A | N/A | N/A | **\$400.0** | 0.917 | **\$366.8** |
| **FY 2026** | \$4,666.4 | 9.5% | \$443.3 | \$400.0 | 15.0% | \$60.0 | **\$503.3** | 0.842 | **\$423.8** |
| **FY 2027** | \$4,899.8 | 10.5% | \$514.5 | \$503.3 | 15.0% | \$75.5 | **\$590.0** | 0.772 | **\$455.4** |
| **FY 2028** | \$5,134.4 | 11.0% | \$564.8 | \$590.0 | 15.0% | \$88.5 | **\$653.3** | 0.708 | **\$462.6** |
| **FY 2029** | \$5,330.1 | 11.0% | \$586.3 | \$653.3 | 15.0% | \$98.0 | **\$684.3** | 0.650 | **\$444.8** |
| **FY 2030** | \$5,490.0 | 11.0% | \$603.9 | \$684.3 | 15.0% | \$102.6 | **\$706.5** | 0.596 | **\$420.7** |
| **Sum of PVs (2025-2030)** | | | | | | | | | **\$2,574.1** |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | | | | | | **\$6,260.6** |

*All dollar values in millions USD.*

### Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Model on the final cash flow for the DCF (Net Income for DCF (E) for FY 2030).

$$TV = \frac{Cash Flow_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Terminal Growth Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Terminal Growth Rate}}$$

$$TV = \frac{\text{\$706.5 million} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\text{\$720.6 million}}{0.07} = \text{\$10,294.3 million}$$

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the Terminal Value is calculated by discounting it back to the present (Year 2024) using the last discount factor:

$$\text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \text{\$10,294.3 million} \times 0.596 = \text{\$6,135.2 million}$$

## 5. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$76.80** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$74.58** |
| **Valuation Difference** | **+3.0%** |

The calculated fair value of **\$76.80** is only **3.0% higher** than the current market price of \$74.58, indicating that under the conservative assumptions used in this model, the stock is currently trading very close to its intrinsic value.

### Justification of Assumptions and Market Comparison

The model's fair value aligns closely with the market price because the conservative assumptions reflect the current known headwinds while incorporating a realistic view of the company's long-term strengths:

1.  **Revenue and Margin Conservatism:** The **-2.5% revenue decline** assumed for FY 2025 (low end of guidance) and the moderate post-2027 long-term growth of $3.0\%$ are conservative. The market is pricing in the current macro-headwinds impacting the Residential segment and the uncertainty of a full recovery.
2.  **Margin Expansion is Key:** The projected margin expansion (from 9.0% Net Income Margin in 2025 to 11.0% by 2028) due to the **\$100+ million AMP savings program** is crucial to the valuation. The market is also likely placing significant weight on management's ability to execute these cost-saving measures to offset the Residential segment's drag and maintain profitability.
3.  **ROIC & Discount Rate:** The **15.0% ROIC** (below historical averages) and **9.0% Discount Rate** are conservative, providing a necessary margin of safety. The close valuation suggests the market's implied long-term assumptions for growth and profitability are very similar to the ones modeled here: low single-digit perpetual growth powered by internal efficiencies (AMP program) and stable growth in the Professional segment.

In summary, the market is making similar assumptions to this conservative model: it is expecting short-term weakness driven by the Residential segment but is confident in The Toro Company's ability to drive profitability through cost-saving measures (AMP program) and steady performance in its dominant Professional segment (underground construction, golf, and grounds). The slight undervaluation in this model suggests a small, rational expectation of successful execution on the AMP program and a mild cyclical recovery in the Residential market.
