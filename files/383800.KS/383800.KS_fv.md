## **Part 2: Business Engine & Revenue/Net Income Projection**

As a pure holding company, LX Holdings's (383800.KS) Net Income is primarily generated from dividends and equity-method gains/losses from its subsidiaries. To project the holding company's Net Income (which serves as the basis for Free Cash Flow to Equity), we must analyze the key drivers of its subsidiaries (the business engine).

### **Business Engine Analysis (Subsidiaries):**

1.  **LX International & LX Pantos (Logistics & Resources):**
    *   **Drivers:** LX Pantos (Logistics) is a primary positive driver, supported by strong container shipping market conditions. LX International's resources segment (coal, palm oil) introduces commodity price volatility but is supported by increased production from new assets (e.g., Chinese coal mines).
    *   **Outlook:** Substantial Net Profit growth is anticipated by market analysts (from KRW 117B in 2023 to over KRW 249B in 2025) which, if realized, will significantly boost the holding company’s equity method income.
2.  **LX Semicon (Semiconductors):**
    *   **Drivers:** The company is actively diversifying its customer base beyond LG Display (e.g., expanding shipments to China's BOE) and entering high-growth, high-margin areas such as VR device Display Driver ICs (DDIs), automotive heat sink boards, and next-gen AI-related system semiconductors.
    *   **Outlook:** Operating Profit is projected to grow by nearly 15% in 2025 due to portfolio diversification and entry into new markets.
3.  **LX Hausys (Building Materials):**
    *   **Drivers:** Focus on premium products (PF insulation, engineered stone in the US) and export expansion, alongside cost structure improvements.
    *   **Outlook:** While the domestic building market is slow, the focus on high-margin products and exports is expected to keep profitability elevated (Net Margin forecasted to improve through 2027).

### **Net Income Projection & Assumptions**

Given the strong, diversified growth drivers across the subsidiaries and management's commitment to new, higher-margin segments, we will use a **constant and conservative growth rate** for the Holding Company's Net Income to Common.

| Assumption | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Growth Rate (2025-2030)** | **+5.0% per annum** | This is a conservative rate, significantly lower than the explicit growth/turnaround projections for key subsidiaries (LX Int'l/Pantos, LX Semicon). This buffers against commodity price volatility and market risk, fulfilling the "be conservative" rule. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | **+5.0%** | The TTM ROIC for LX Semicon is approximately 8.95%. A conservative, stable ROIC of 5.0% is applied to the prior year's retained Net Income (cash) to account for additional investment/interest income. |

### **Projected Net Income to Common (Millions KRW)**
$Net Income_{Year}$ = $Net Income_{Year-1} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) + (\text{Prior Year Cash Flow} \times \text{ROIC})$
*Note: For the holding company with minimal CapEx, Net Income is approximated as Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the DCF model.*

| Year | Starting Net Income (A) | Net Income Growth @ 5.0% (B) | ROIC on Previous Year's Cash (C) | Projected Net Income / FCFE (A+C) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of FCFE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | 157,262 | - | - | 157,262 | - | - |
| **2025** | 165,125 (A*1.05) | 7,863 | 7,863 (157,262 * 5.0%) | 173,068 | 0.917 | 158,690 |
| **2026** | 173,381 (165,125 * 1.05) | 8,256 | 8,653 (173,068 * 5.0%) | 182,034 | 0.842 | 153,284 |
| **2027** | 182,050 (173,381 * 1.05) | 8,670 | 9,102 (182,034 * 5.0%) | 191,152 | 0.772 | 147,566 |
| **2028** | 191,152 (182,050 * 1.05) | 9,114 | 9,558 (191,152 * 5.0%) | 200,709 | 0.708 | 142,109 |
| **2029** | 200,709 (191,152 * 1.05) | 9,577 | 10,035 (200,709 * 5.0%) | 210,744 | 0.650 | 136,944 |

## **Part 3: Terminal Value and Fair Value Calculation**

### **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

#### **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (2030).
*   **Final FCFE ($FCFE_{2030}$):** KRW 221,281 Million
*   **Maturity Rate (g_terminal):** 2.0% (Very conservative, long-term economic growth proxy)
*   **Discount Rate (r):** 9.0%

$TV_{2030} = \frac{FCFE_{2030} \times (1 + g_{\text{terminal}})}{r - g_{\text{terminal}}}$

$TV_{2030} = \frac{221,281 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{225,707}{0.07}$

$TV_{2030} = 3,224,386 \text{ Million KRW}$

#### **Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value**

$NPV \text{ of } TV = \frac{TV_{2030}}{(1 + r)^{6}}$

$NPV \text{ of } TV = \frac{3,224,386}{(1.09)^{6}} = \frac{3,224,386}{1.677}$

$NPV \text{ of } TV = 1,922,604 \text{ Million KRW}$

#### **Total Equity Value**

$Total \text{ Equity Value} = NPV \text{ of FCFE}_{2025-2030} + NPV \text{ of } TV + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$

$Total \text{ Equity Value} = 870,468 + 1,922,604 + 312,100 - 0$

$Total \text{ Equity Value} = 3,105,172 \text{ Million KRW}$

### **Fair Value Per Share**

$Fair \text{ Value Per Share} = \frac{Total \text{ Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$Fair \text{ Value Per Share} = \frac{3,105,172,000,000 \text{ KRW}}{78,000,000 \text{ shares}}$

$Fair \text{ Value Per Share} = 39,810 \text{ KRW}$

## **Part 4: Conclusion and Market Comparison**

| Metric | Value (KRW) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **39,810 KRW** |
| **Current Market Price** | **8,130 KRW** |
| **Difference** | **31,680 KRW** |
| **Implied Upside** | **389.7%** |

### **Justification for Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Price)**

The calculated Fair Value of **39,810 KRW** is significantly higher (nearly 4.9 times) than the current market price of **8,130 KRW**. This massive discrepancy suggests that the market is making radically different, and much more conservative, assumptions about the company's future value.

#### **Market's Implied Assumptions**

The market appears to be assigning a deep "Holding Company Discount" and applying highly conservative assumptions for growth and cash flow. The key assumptions the market is likely making are:

1.  **Deep Holding Company Discount:** The market often values pure holding companies based on the market value of their listed subsidiaries, then applies a massive discount (e.g., 50-80%) due to the complex corporate structure, minority shareholder risk, and potential for misallocation of capital by the parent. LX Holdings's value is currently trading at a fraction of the theoretical sum of its subsidiaries' parts.
2.  **Zero or Negative Real Growth for Income Drivers:** The market is likely pricing in *zero* or *negative* long-term real growth for the highly cyclical businesses (Commodities, Logistics, and Semiconductors) owned by the subsidiaries. The market fears that:
    *   **LX International's** strong earnings from commodities and logistics (LX Pantos) are temporary/cyclical peaks, and future earnings will normalize downward.
    *   **LX Semicon**'s diversification efforts may fail to generate high-margin growth in the crowded semiconductor market.
3.  **High Discount Rate/WACC:** The market is likely using a much higher implied discount rate than the conservative 9.0% used in this model, reflecting a higher perceived risk due to:
    *   **Geopolitical and Economic Volatility:** South Korea's economic exposure and the volatility of global commodity and chip markets.
    *   **Lack of Liquidity/Transparency:** As an unlisted holding company whose main asset is the stock of a listed subsidiary (LX International, etc.), the cash flows and strategic decisions are less transparent than the subsidiaries themselves.

#### **Justification of DCF Model Assumptions**

The model's $39,810 \text{ KRW}$ Fair Value stands on the following reasonable, justifiable assumptions:

1.  **Conservative Growth Rate:** The chosen **5.0%** Net Income growth rate is **already conservative**. LX International alone is projected to see a massive jump in profitability in the near term, and LX Semicon is entering new, high-growth areas. 5.0% is a modest long-term growth rate for a diversified group of companies with clear strategic expansion.
2.  **Zero Debt & High Cash:** The holding company's **zero debt** position and **high cash reserves** (KRW 312.1B) significantly enhance the FCFE and reduce its intrinsic risk. The market is ignoring this robust balance sheet.
3.  **Conservative Terminal Value:** The **2.0%** maturity rate is in line with the long-term inflation/GDP of a developed economy, which is the definition of a *conservative* terminal growth rate.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The market is currently pricing LX Holdings Corp. as a low-growth, high-risk entity subject to a punitive holding company discount. The DCF model suggests that the **intrinsic value** is significantly higher, driven by the strong, diversified subsidiary business engines and a clean balance sheet at the holding company level. The massive difference represents the market's current **lack of confidence** in the sustainability of the subsidiaries' earnings and the holding company's ability to unlock or realize the full value of its assets for its shareholders. This suggests the stock is currently **significantly undervalued** based on intrinsic value.
