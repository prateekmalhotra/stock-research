#### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine of Southwest Airlines is driven by a simple equation:
$$\text{Revenue} = \text{Capacity (ASMs)} \times \text{Unit Revenue (RASM)}$$

The company is undergoing a **"Southwest Even Better"** strategic transformation focused on driving incremental revenue through new offerings (assigned seating, extra legroom, bag fees) and significant cost reduction. This justifies modeling the future with accelerating revenue and margin expansion.

**Key Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Capacity (ASMs) Growth:** Management has guided for a low-single-digit capacity growth post-2024, aiming to keep growth below macroeconomic trends to focus on returns.
    *   **Assumption:** **1.5%** for 2025, increasing slightly to a conservative **2.0%** from 2026 onward.
2.  **Unit Revenue (RASM) Growth:** RASM is expected to improve due to the new high-margin revenue initiatives.
    *   **Base RASM Growth (Ex-Initiatives):** A conservative $\mathbf{0.5\%}$ annual increase is assumed from 2026-2030, reflecting long-term stable yield growth in a mature industry. 2025 is projected slightly higher at $1.0\%$ based on Q4 2025 guidance of up 1\% to 3\%. [cite: 2 in step 2]
    *   **Ancillary Revenue Initiatives:** The stated incremental EBIT targets are modeled directly into the operating income, as this is the primary driver of future profitability.

**Revenue Projection Table (in millions)**

| Year | Capacity Growth (ASM) | Base RASM Growth | Total Revenue Growth | Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual Base)** | N/A | N/A | N/A | $\mathbf{\$27,600}$ |
| **2025** | 1.5% | 1.0% | 2.5% | $\mathbf{\$28,290}$ |
| **2026** | 2.0% | 0.5% | 2.5% | $\mathbf{\$29,000}$ |

#### III. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Projections

##### A. Margin and Cash Flow Assumptions

1.  **EBIT Margin:** The core of the model is incorporating management's guidance on incremental EBIT and cost savings.
    *   **Incremental EBIT:** **$\text{\$1.0B}$ in 2026**, ramping to a run-rate of **$\text{\$1.5B}$ in 2027** and holding steady through 2030. [cite: 2 in step 2]
    *   **Cost Savings:** **$\text{\$0.5B}$ in run-rate cost savings in 2027**, ramping from 2026. [cite: 1 in step 2]
    *   **2025 EBIT:** The management-guided range is $\text{\$600M}$ to $\text{\$800M}$. I will use a conservative **$\text{\$700M}$**. [cite: 2 in step 2]
    *   **Core Operating Margin (Ex-Initiatives):** Projected Operating Expenses are calculated by subtracting the initiatives/cost savings from the projected Operating Income, which recovers toward historical norms.
    *   **Tax Rate:** **25.0%** (Conservative US corporate tax rate).
2.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The company’s long-term goal is to achieve an after-tax ROIC well above its WACC. Pre-pandemic ROIC averaged $\approx 12\%$.
    *   **Assumption:** A conservative **8.0%** ROIC is applied to the prior year's retained Net Income (cash) to generate additional non-operational income.
3.  **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative rate for a mature, capital-intensive airline business with recent labor cost increases.
    *   **Assumption (WACC):** **10.0%**.
4.  **Perpetual Growth Rate ($g$):** A very conservative long-term growth rate for the terminal value, reflecting a mature company at market maturity.
    *   **Assumption:** **2.0%**.

(1) 2024 Net Income excluding special items.

##### C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The projected cash flows are the Net Income for the year (which, by rule, goes straight to cash) plus the ROIC income.

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (F) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $\text{\$561}$ | 0.909 | $\text{\$510}$ |
| **2026** | $\text{\$1,317}$ | 0.826 | $\text{\$1,088}$ |
| **2027** | $\text{\$1,977}$ | 0.751 | $\text{\$1,484}$ |
| **2028** | $\text{\$2,070}$ | 0.683 | $\text{\$1,414}$ |
| **2029** | $\text{\$2,119}$ | 0.621 | $\text{\$1,316}$ |
| **2030** | $\text{\$2,169}$ | 0.564 | $\text{\$1,223}$ |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$\text{\$7,035}$** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the perpetuity growth formula on the 2030 Cash Flow, assuming a 2.0% perpetual growth rate ($g$) and a 10.0% discount rate ($WACC$).

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{WACC - g} = \frac{\text{\$2,169M} \times (1.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \text{\$27,655M}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value (TV-NPV)**

$$
\text{TV-NPV} = \frac{\text{TV}_{2030}}{(1 + WACC)^{5.5}} = \frac{\text{\$27,655M}}{(1.10)^{5.5}} = \text{\$16,211M}
$$

**Total Net Present Value (Enterprise Value)**

$$\text{Total NPV} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{TV-NPV}$$
$$\text{Total NPV} = \text{\$7,035M} + \text{\$16,211M} = \mathbf{\$23,246M}$$

---

#### IV. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Liquid Assets} - \text{Total Debt}$$
$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{\$23,246M} + \text{\$9,700M} - \text{\$6,700M} = \mathbf{\$26,246M}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$
$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{\$26,246,000,000}}{599,737,219} = \mathbf{\$43.76 \text{ per share}}$$

### V. Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Fair Value (Calculated) | Current Market Value (Hypothetical) | Variance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share Price** | **$\text{\$43.76}$** | $\text{\$28.00}$ (for example) | $\sim +56\%$ |

*Note: As of the last market close, the actual stock price would be noted here. Assuming a hypothetical current market value of $\text{\$28.00}$ for the purpose of the comparison.*

**Current Market Value ($28.00)**

**Justification for the Valuation Discrepancy:**

The calculated fair value of $\mathbf{\$43.76}$ is significantly higher than the hypothetical market price of $\text{\$28.00}$, suggesting the market is not fully pricing in the success of the management's transformation plan.

The market is making a key assumption that is highly conservative, or even pessimistic, regarding the profitability and durability of Southwest's business engine. This is likely due to:

1.  **Skepticism on Ancillary Revenue Execution:** The $\text{\$1.5B}$ incremental EBIT from assigned seating, extra legroom, and new fare products represents a $\sim 250\%$ increase over 2024 Net Income (excluding special items). The market is skeptical about the management's ability to execute this shift from its traditional model without alienating its core customer base or facing aggressive competitive response, thus likely assuming the run-rate will be significantly lower, perhaps only $\text{\$0.5B}$ to $\text{\$0.7B}$.
2.  **Cost Inflation Uncertainty (CASM-X):** While management guides for a **low-single-digit CASM-X by late 2025**, the previous quarters saw high unit cost inflation due to new, expensive labor contracts. The market may be assuming the **$\text{\$0.5B}$ in run-rate cost savings is necessary just to offset future, unexpected inflationary pressures** (especially fuel and labor) rather than contributing to incremental net income, thereby drastically compressing the projected margins.
3.  **Low Terminal Value Assumption:** The market may be applying a much lower perpetual growth rate ($g$) or a higher WACC, fearing the company is reaching a cyclical peak and will be unable to grow cash flow beyond the next few years. A lower perpetuity growth rate of $0.0\%$ would reduce the Terminal Value NPV to approximately $\text{\$12.8B}$, dropping the Fair Value per Share to $\text{\$37.56}$. The difference is substantial, indicating the market is being cautious on long-term growth.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The $\mathbf{\$43.76}$ fair value is a direct reflection of taking management's core guidance and targets (the $\text{\$1.5B}$ EBIT and $\text{\$0.5B}$ cost savings) as truth and modeling a successful transformation. This valuation implies the company is undervalued, as its core competitive advantage (low-cost structure) is being enhanced by new premium revenue streams, pointing to a recovery in margins back toward historical healthy levels. The market is likely pricing LUV as if the transformation will only be partially successful, or that cost pressures will fully erode the benefits of the new revenue initiatives.
