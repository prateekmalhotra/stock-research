## 1. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Southwest's primary business engine drivers are capacity growth (measured in Available Seat Miles or ASM) and unit revenue (RASM/Yield). The current growth strategy is focused on **yield-driven incremental revenue** from new customer-facing initiatives rather than aggressive capacity expansion.

Management guidance confirms this focus:
*   **Capacity:** Expected to be modest, in the **1% to 2%** range through 2027. (from step 2)
*   **Initiatives:** Core of the near-term revenue growth.
    *   **2026 Incremental EBIT:** More than **\$1 billion** from assigned/extra legroom seating and a full year of bag fees.
    *   **2027 Incremental EBIT (Full Run-Rate):** Approximately **\$1.5 billion**.

### Revenue Projections Rationale:

The revenue forecast is constructed conservatively by combining the following:

1.  **Capacity-Based Growth:** A conservative base growth rate of **1.5%** for all years (the midpoint of management's 1-2% guidance).
2.  **Initiative-Based Revenue:** Modeling the incremental EBIT contribution as a proxy for revenue growth, given the focus on yield-enhancing products. A conservative assumption is made that the incremental **EBIT** is approximately **1.2x** the incremental **Net Income** (assuming a 20% tax rate, $\text{Net Income} = \text{EBIT} \times (1-0.2)$).

| Year | Capacity Growth Assumption | Base Revenue (Capacity Effect) | Incremental EBIT from Initiatives | Total Revenue | Calculation Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | \$27.50 B | N/A | \$27.50 B | Base Year. (from step 2) |
| **2025 (Est.)** | 1.50% | \$27.91 B | \$0.60 B | **\$28.51 B** | **Base:** \$27.5B * 1.015. **Initiatives:** Using the low end of the \$600M-\$800M EBIT guide for the full year 2025. |
| **2026 (Est.)** | 1.50% | \$28.33 B | \$1.00 B | **\$29.33 B** | **Base:** \$27.91B * 1.015. **Initiatives:** Using the lower-bound guidance of \$1.0B incremental EBIT. |
| **2027 (Est.)** | 1.50% | \$28.75 B | \$1.50 B | **\$30.25 B** | **Base:** \$28.33B * 1.015. **Initiatives:** Using the full run-rate guidance of \$1.5B incremental EBIT. |
| **2028 (Est.)** | 1.00% | \$29.04 B | \$0.00 B | **\$30.54 B** | **Base:** \$28.75B * 1.01. **Initiatives:** Incremental growth stops. Reverts to a lower, conservative 1.0% growth rate (below historical norm, as the major initiatives mature). |
| **2029 (Est.)** | 1.00% | \$29.33 B | \$0.00 B | **\$30.83 B** | **Base:** \$29.04B * 1.01. |
| **2030 (Est.)** | 1.00% | \$29.62 B | \$0.00 B | **\$31.12 B** | **Base:** \$29.33B * 1.01. |

## 2. Margin and Net Income Projections

### Margin Rationale:

*   **2024 Net Margin:** 1.69% (\$465M / \$27,500M) (from step 2).
*   **Management Target:** Operating margins of **10% or more** by 2027. (from step 2)
*   **Projection:** I will conservatively project a ramp-up to a sustainable net margin of **6.0%** by 2028, significantly below the implied 2027 operating margin target of 10% (which would translate to ~8% Net Margin). This incorporates cost inflation and competitive pressures that could dampen management's optimistic targets, but still reflects the benefit of the **\$1.5 billion** EBIT run-rate.

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Assumed Net Margin % | Projected Net Income (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$27.50 B | 1.69% | \$0.465 B |
| **2025 (Est.)** | \$28.51 B | 2.50% | \$0.713 B |
| **2026 (Est.)** | \$29.33 B | 4.00% | \$1.173 B |
| **2027 (Est.)** | \$30.25 B | 5.50% | \$1.664 B |
| **2028 (Est.)** | \$30.54 B | 6.00% | \$1.832 B |
| **2029 (Est.)** | \$30.83 B | 6.00% | \$1.850 B |
| **2030 (Est.)** | \$31.12 B | 6.00% | \$1.867 B |

### Net Income with ROIC Calculation

The rule is: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Management guided an ROIC of **5% to 8% in 2025**, with a target of **15% or more in 2027**. (from step 2)
*   **Conservative ROIC:** I will use a conservative, stable rate of **6.0%** for the reinvested portion (Net Income from the previous year). This is within the low-end of their near-term guidance.

| Year | Projected Net Income (A) | Prior Year's Net Income (B) | ROIC % | Additional Income (B * ROIC %) | **Final Net Income (A + C)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$0.713 B | \$0.465 B (2024) | 6.00% | \$0.028 B | **\$0.741 B** |
| **2026** | \$1.173 B | \$0.741 B (2025) | 6.00% | \$0.044 B | **\$1.217 B** |
| **2027** | \$1.664 B | \$1.217 B (2026) | 6.00% | \$0.073 B | **\$1.737 B** |
| **2028** | \$1.832 B | \$1.737 B (2027) | 6.00% | \$0.104 B | **\$1.936 B** |
| **2029** | \$1.850 B | \$1.936 B (2028) | 6.00% | \$0.116 B | **\$1.966 B** |
| **2030** | \$1.867 B | \$1.966 B (2029) | 6.00% | \$0.118 B | **\$1.985 B** |

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The **Final Net Income** is used as the projected Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the DCF model, per the instructions.

### Assumptions:

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** The airline industry, particularly in the post-MAX and post-COVID era, carries high operating and market risk. I will use a conservative (high) discount rate of **10.0%**.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A conservative rate is required. Airlines are a mature, cyclical, and low-margin industry. I will use **2.0%**, which is below long-term GDP growth and reflects a conservative, mature industry growth profile.

### DCF Calculation:

| Year (t) | Projected FCF (Billion) | Discount Factor @ 10.0% | NPV of FCF (Billion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | \$0.741 | 0.909 | \$0.673 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | \$1.217 | 0.826 | \$1.005 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | \$1.737 | 0.751 | \$1.304 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | \$1.936 | 0.683 | \$1.322 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | \$1.966 | 0.621 | \$1.220 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | \$1.985 | 0.564 | \$1.120 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **\$6.644 B** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (2030):

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
$$ \text{TV} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} $$
Where:
*   $\text{FCF}_{2030} = \$1.985 \text{ Billion}$
*   $\text{g} = 2.0\% \text{ (Maturity Rate)}$
*   $\text{WACC} = 10.0\% \text{ (Discount Rate)}$

$$ \text{TV} = \frac{\$1.985 \text{ B} \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$2.025 \text{ B}}{0.08} = \$25.313 \text{ Billion} $$

**NPV of Terminal Value:**
$$ \text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$25.313 \text{ B} \times 0.564 = \mathbf{\$14.277 \text{ Billion}} $$

### Total Net Present Value (NPV):

$$ \text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV of Explicit Period} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} $$
$$ \text{Total NPV} = \$6.644 \text{ B} + \$14.277 \text{ B} = \mathbf{\$20.921 \text{ Billion}} $$

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated as:
$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Total Liquid Cash} - \text{Total Debt} $$

| Metric | Value (Billion) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV (Calculated)** | \$20.921 B | DCF Result |
| **Add: Total Liquid Cash** | \$3.000 B | Q3 2025 10-Q. |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$4.124 B | Q3 2025 Est. (Adjusted) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **\$19.797 Billion** | |

**Fair Value Per Share:**
$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$
$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$19,797,000,000}{517,155,080} = \mathbf{\$38.28} $$

## Summary and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$38.28** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **\$33.74** |
| **Difference** | **+\$4.54** |
| **Implied Upside** | **13.46%** |

### Justification of Fair Value and Market Assumptions

The calculated fair value of **\$38.28** is approximately **13.5% higher** than the current market price of **\$33.74**.

**Justification for the Calculated Fair Value being Higher than Market Price:**

The market is making a more conservative assumption about the execution and sustained success of Southwest's "Even Better" transformation plan than my model.

1.  **Discounted Net Margin:** My model projects a stable, conservative Net Margin of **6.0%** from 2028 onwards, which is significantly lower than the **implied Net Margin of ~8.0%** from management's 10% Operating Margin target for 2027. If the market believed the company could reach 10% operating margins reliably, the stock price would be much higher. The market is likely discounting this target due to:
    *   **Labor Inflation:** The airline industry faces high labor costs, which are partially offset by the new revenue initiatives but represent a significant headwind.
    *   **Operational Risk/Boeing Delays:** Operational reliability issues (like the late 2022 meltdown) and ongoing delivery issues with Boeing create uncertainty that pressures the valuation multiple.
    *   **Yield Sustainability:** The market may doubt the long-term sustainability of the incremental revenue from assigned seating and bag fees in a highly competitive, fungible product environment.

2.  **Conservative ROIC/DCF Inputs:** Even with the higher valuation, my assumptions are quite conservative:
    *   **ROIC (6.0%):** Lower end of the 2025 guidance and far below the 2027 target of 15%+. This is a strong conservative buffer.
    *   **Discount Rate (10.0%):** A high discount rate for a major U.S. airline, reflecting market risk but also applying a punitive discount for execution uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

The valuation suggests that the current market price of \$33.74 already includes a substantial discount for execution risk, particularly regarding the ability to achieve and sustain the management's ambitious margin targets (10%+ operating margin). My fair value of **\$38.28** is only modestly higher because my projection for Net Margin (6.0%) and ROIC (6.0%) is highly conservative, reflecting only a partial success of the company's transformation plan. The \$4.54 difference represents the market's expectation that the company will undershoot this conservative level or that there is a higher probability of macroeconomic or competitive headwinds.
