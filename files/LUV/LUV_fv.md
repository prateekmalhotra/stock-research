## Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) Valuation

### I. Initial Financial Data

The initial financial data is sourced from the Company's most recent public financial disclosures, primarily the Q3 2025 earnings information, which is current as of the valuation date (October 26, 2025).

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source/As Of Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$32.20** | October 24, 2025 |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **518.82 million** | Most Recent Public Data |
| **Total Cash & Equivalents** | **\$3,000 million** | Q3 2025 End (Sep 30, 2025) (Includes short-term investments) |
| **Total Debt** | **\$5,341 million** | Q2 2025 End (June 30, 2025) (Current & Non-Current) |

**Note on Total Debt:** The most recent complete Total Debt figure (Current + Non-Current) of \$5.341 billion is used as of Q2 2025, as a complete breakdown was not available for the Q3 2025 period in the preliminary earnings release data.

### II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projections

The primary driver for Southwest Airlines' revenue growth is shifting from simple capacity expansion (Available Seat Miles - ASM) to **strategic revenue initiatives** (bag fees, assigned seating, premium products, loyalty enhancements) and **cost-control** (CASM-X). The management's commentary focuses heavily on a multi-year transformation plan, providing specific incremental EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) targets.

**Key Management Guidance & Business Engine Drivers:**

1.  **Incremental EBIT Target:** Management's transformation plan targets **\$1.8 billion in incremental EBIT in 2025** and a further increase to **\$4.3 billion of incremental EBIT in 2026** from a portfolio of Southwest-specific initiatives.
2.  **Specific Initiative Contribution:** Assigned and extra legroom seating are expected to contribute **more than \$1.0 billion of incremental EBIT in 2026** and hit a full run-rate of approximately **\$1.5 billion in 2027**. A full year of revenue from bag fees is expected in 2026.
3.  **Capacity (ASM) Growth:** Full-year 2025 capacity growth is conservative, at roughly **1%** year-over-year. Capacity is expected to remain disciplined.
4.  **2025 EBIT Guidance:** Reaffirmed at a range of **\$600 million to \$800 million** (excluding special items).
5.  **2024 Performance (Base Year):** Record operating revenues of **\$27.5 billion**. Net Income (excl. special items) was **\$597 million**, resulting in a Net Income Margin of $\approx$ **2.17%**.

**Revenue Projections Model (2025 - 2030):**

To project future revenue, we will use the reported 2024 Revenue as a baseline and then project the incremental revenue needed to hit the management's ambitious EBIT targets, while applying a conservative operating margin assumption.

| Year | Revenue Projection (in millions USD) | Justification/Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | **\$27,500** | Actual record full-year operating revenues. |
| **2025** | **\$28,875** | **1.0% Capacity Growth** (ASM-driven revenue growth) + **3.7% Yield/RASM Growth** (Below 2024's 8.0% RASM growth as the market normalizes, but incorporates early initiative benefits) = **5.0% Revenue Growth.** |
| **2026** | **\$31,473** | **+9.0% YoY Revenue Growth.** This aggressive jump is necessary to incorporate the full value of the **\$4.3 billion incremental EBIT** initiative target. The large increase assumes successful realization of assigned seating, bag fees, and other product differentiation initiatives, which must largely translate to revenue to achieve the EBIT increase. |
| **2027** | **\$32,975** | **+4.77% YoY Revenue Growth.** Reflects the final ramp-up of initiatives, specifically the **\$1.5 billion full run-rate incremental EBIT** from seating, and assumes normalized, moderate industry growth (e.g., 2% capacity + 2.7% RASM/Yield). |
| **2028** | **\$34,354** | **+4.2% YoY Revenue Growth.** Assumes sustained, but moderating, growth from a now-mature 'Even Better' plan, network maturation, and new market expansion (e.g., 2.5% Capacity + 1.7% RASM/Yield). |
| **2029** | **\$35,485** | **+3.3% YoY Revenue Growth.** Growth slows to near long-term GDP + Inflation rate, reflecting a conservative, mature airline business model (e.g., 2% Capacity + 1.3% RASM/Yield). |
| **2030** | **\$36,368** | **+2.5% YoY Revenue Growth.** The long-term, conservative growth rate for a mature U.S. domestic airline. |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection

**Margin Assumptions:**

*   **Net Income Margin (2024):** **2.17%** (Calculated from 2024 data, excluding special items).
*   **Net Income Margin (2025):** We will use the midpoint of the management's EBIT guidance.
    *   2025 Revenue: \$28,875M
    *   2025 EBIT Midpoint: $\frac{(\$600M + \$800M)}{2} = \$700M$.
    *   2025 EBIT Margin: $\frac{\$700M}{\$28,875M} \approx 2.42\%$

For the projection years (2026-2030), the management's target of \$4.3 billion incremental EBIT in 2026 is extremely aggressive. A conservative approach is to project a modest but steady improvement in Net Income Margin, driven by the successful execution of the high-value, high-margin revenue initiatives (ancillary revenue).

**Net Income Margin Projection (Conservative):**

| Year | Assumed Net Income Margin (%) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 2.17% | Historical result. |
| **2025** | 2.42% | Midpoint of management's EBIT guidance, conservatively converted to Net Income. |
| **2026** | 3.50% | Reflects a significant but *conservative* margin expansion (a large part of the targeted \$4.3B incremental EBIT) as high-margin ancillary revenue (bag fees, assigned seating) hits full stride. |
| **2027** | 4.25% | Reaches a solid, but not industry-leading, margin as the initiatives mature to full run-rate, showing the company has successfully transformed its revenue model. |
| **2028** | 4.50% | Marginal improvement stabilizes as all strategic initiatives become core business. |
| **2029** | 4.50% | Stable performance. |
| **2030** | 4.50% | Stable performance into the terminal year. |

**ROIC Assumption:**

*   **Rule:** Assume Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage from the past to get additional income for the next year.
*   **Historical ROIC (LUV):** Historically, LUV's ROIC has been volatile. For a conservative and reasonable positive assumption for a capital-intensive airline that is actively investing in fleet and IT, a modest but sustainable return is prudent.
*   **Assumed Conservative ROIC:** **4.0%**

**Projected Net Income Calculation:**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Margin (B) | Net Income from Operations (C) = A x B | Carryover Income (D) = Net Income (t-1) x 4.0% | Total Net Income (E) = C + D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$27,500 | 2.17% | \$597 | - | - |
| **2025** | \$28,875 | 2.42% | \$700 | \$23.88 (a) | **\$724** |
| **2026** | \$31,473 | 3.50% | \$1,102 | \$28.96 | **\$1,131** |
| **2027** | \$32,975 | 4.25% | \$1,401 | \$45.23 | **\$1,446** |
| **2028** | \$34,354 | 4.50% | \$1,546 | \$57.85 | **\$1,604** |
| **2029** | \$35,485 | 4.50% | \$1,597 | \$64.16 | **\$1,661** |
| **2030** | \$36,368 | 4.50% | \$1,637 | \$66.45 | **\$1,703** |

*(a) Carryover Income for 2025 uses 4.0% of the Net Income excluding special items from 2024: $597M x 4.0\% = $23.88M.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

For DCF, we will use the Total Net Income (E) as the proxy for free cash flow (FCF), as per the assumption that net income goes straight into cash.

**Discount Rate & Maturity Rate Assumptions:**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **10.0%**. This is a reasonable, high rate for a cyclical airline business with significant operating leverage and sensitivity to fuel prices and economic downturns.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.0%**. This is below the long-term US GDP growth rate, appropriate for a mature, capital-intensive domestic airline business.

**NPV of Explicit Forecast Period (2025-2030):**

| Year (t) | Projected FCF (Net Income) (E) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of FCF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=0.99)** | \$724 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{0.99}}$ = 0.9099 | \$659 |
| **2026 (t=1.99)** | \$1,131 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{1.99}}$ = 0.8267 | \$935 |
| **2027 (t=2.99)** | \$1,446 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{2.99}}$ = 0.7516 | \$1,087 |
| **2028 (t=3.99)** | \$1,604 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{3.99}}$ = 0.6834 | \$1,096 |
| **2029 (t=4.99)** | \$1,661 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{4.99}}$ = 0.6214 | \$1,032 |
| **2030 (t=5.99)** | \$1,703 | $\frac{1}{(1+0.10)^{5.99}}$ = 0.5649 | \$962 |
| **Sum of NPV (Explicit Period)** | | | **\$5,771 million** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model (GGM) on the 2030 FCF.
*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{FCF_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$
*   $TV_{2030} = \frac{\$1,703 \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.10 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$1,737}{\$0.08} = \$21,712$ million

**NPV of Terminal Value:**

*   $NPV(TV) = TV_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   $NPV(TV) = \$21,712 \times 0.5649 = **\$12,269 million**$

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**

*   $Total~NPV = NPV(\text{Explicit Period}) + NPV(TV)$
*   $Total~NPV = \$5,771 \text{ million} + \$12,269 \text{ million} = **\$18,040 million**$

### V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | \$18,040 |
| **Plus: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$3,000 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$5,341) |
| **Equity Value** | **\$15,699 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 518.82 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\frac{\$15,699 \text{ million}}{518.82 \text{ million}} = **\$30.26**$ |

## Fair Value and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) is **\$30.26**.

The **Current Market Value Per Share** is **\$32.20**.

Our calculated Fair Value is approximately **6.0\% lower** than the current market price.

### Justification of Difference and Market Assumptions

The difference between the intrinsic value (\$30.26) and the market price (\$32.20) is small (a \$1.94 difference), suggesting the market's assumptions are largely aligned with our conservative projections, but slightly more optimistic on one or two key variables.

**Our Conservative Assumptions:**
1.  **Discount Rate:** We used a high **10.0%** discount rate, reflecting the risk and cyclicality of the airline industry. A lower discount rate (e.g., 9.5% or 9.0%) would increase the NPV and the fair value significantly.
2.  **Margin Growth:** We were conservative in converting the aggressive management-guided **incremental EBIT targets** into Net Income margins. The **\$4.3 billion incremental EBIT in 2026** is a massive figure for a company with a 2024 operating profit of $\sim\$700M$. Our projected 2026 Net Income Margin of **3.50%** (resulting in Net Income of \$1.131B) assumes the company will *not* fully realize the ambitious EBIT targets or will incur higher associated costs (CAPEX, operations) than currently modeled. The market may be assuming the company realizes a margin closer to **4.0% - 5.0%** in 2026, which would imply a successful and more profitable transformation.
3.  **Terminal Growth Rate:** Our **2.0%** terminal growth rate is cautious. Given the long runway for growth in ancillary revenue (assigned seating, bag fees) and fleet modernization, the market might be factoring in a slightly higher long-term growth rate, such as **2.5%**.

**Market's Likely Underlying Assumptions:**

The market is making the following implicit assumptions that lead to a slightly higher price:

*   **Near-Perfect Execution of the Transformation Plan:** The market is giving management credit for its stated goal of reaching the **\$4.3 billion incremental EBIT target in 2026**, believing the new ancillary revenue streams (assigned seating, bag fees, and product differentiation) will be adopted quickly and profitably, leading to higher margins (closer to the 5-7% net margins of its legacy peers).
*   **Faster/Higher Margin Expansion:** The market likely assumes Net Income Margin will exceed our **4.5%** cap and potentially reach **5.0% - 6.0%** in the later years of the forecast, as LUV's cost structure remains lower than its legacy competitors, allowing the new premium revenues to fall straight to the bottom line.
*   **Lower Risk:** The market may view LUV's strong balance sheet (low debt, high cash) and brand loyalty as justifying a slightly lower discount rate, perhaps in the **9.0% - 9.5%** range, which is a common assumption for a blue-chip airline.

In conclusion, our model provides a fair value very close to the market price. The slight discount is a result of applying a **conservative layer of skepticism** to the management's ambitious incremental EBIT growth targets and using a prudent ROIC/Discount Rate. The market is pricing LUV assuming the execution of the "Even Better" plan will be a near-total success, significantly expanding the profit margin of its business model.
