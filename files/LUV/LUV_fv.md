### II. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Southwest's business engine is driven by its low-cost, high-frequency, point-to-point network model. Its revenue is primarily determined by **Capacity (Available Seat Miles - ASMs)** and **Yield (Revenue per ASM - RASM)**.

Management is focused on a significant transformation to drive revenue and control costs, with key initiatives providing the basis for future growth: **assigned seating, extra legroom seats, and bag fees/new fare products**, which are expected to generate a **$1.0 billion run-rate** of incremental EBIT (expected in 2026).

#### Revenue Model Assumptions

| Year | Capacity (ASM) Growth | Yield/RASM Growth | Total Revenue Growth | Rationale (Justification for Estimates) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 2.0% | 1.0% | 3.0% | Conservative growth, reflecting management's reduced capacity growth (approx. 1%) and a partial-year benefit from initial fare/product improvements and base fare inflation. |
| **2026** | 4.0% | 4.0% | 8.2% | **Peak Growth Year.** Assumes full capture of the $\approx\$1.0B new product revenue run rate (which is $\approx\$3.6\%$ of 2025 Rev.) plus a 0.4% base yield increase. Capacity growth accelerates modestly as transformation completes. |
| **2027** | 4.0% | 2.5% | 6.6% | New initiatives mature. Capacity growth stabilizes. Yield growth moderates but remains strong from premium product uptake and modest price hikes. |
| **2028** | 4.0% | 2.0% | 6.1% | Stable, moderate growth reflecting fleet renewal (MAX deliveries) and a healthy US travel market. |
| **2029** | 3.5% | 1.5% | 5.1% | Conservative capacity slowdown, with yield growth matching a slightly elevated inflation/price environment. |
| **2030** | 3.0% | 1.5% | 4.5% | Further moderation toward a long-term growth/maturity rate. |

#### Projected Revenue

| Year | FY 2024 (Actual) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (M)** | **$27,500** | **$28,325** | **$30,643** | **$32,668** | **$34,660** | **$36,432** | **$38,069** |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

Management guided for **FY 2025 EBIT of $600M - $800M** and expects **"meaningful margin expansion"** due to better unit cost control (CASM-X up 1.5%-2.5%) and the new high-yield revenue streams.

#### Net Income Margin Assumptions

| Year | EBIT Margin | Net Income Margin (After 25% Tax) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 2.5% | 1.88% | Based on conservative Net Income of $\approx\$530M (midpoint of EBIT guidance $\approx\$700M$, after 25% tax) on a $\approx\$28.3B Revenue. |
| **2026** | 5.5% | 4.13% | **Major step-up.** Reflects the full benefit of the $\approx\$1.0B$ high-margin revenue initiatives and improved cost control. |
| **2027** | 6.0% | 4.50% | Continued, stable margin expansion as new products are fully integrated and RASM outpaces CASM-X. |
| **2028** | 6.0% | 4.50% | Stable margin for the peak profitability period. |
| **2029** | 5.5% | 4.13% | Conservative moderation, reflecting potential long-term labor or fuel cost pressure. |
| **2030** | 5.0% | 3.75% | Further conservative moderation toward a sustainable, mature-airline margin. |

#### Projected Net Income (DCF Cash Flow)

The rule specifies: $\text{Net Income}_{\text{next year}} = \text{Net Income}_{\text{new year}} + \text{ROIC} \times \text{Net Income}_{\text{previous year}}$

| Year | Projected Revenue (M) | NI Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC Income (B) (3.5% of previous year's NI) | DCF Cash Flow (A + B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $28,325 | 1.88% | $532 | - | **$532** |
| **2026** | $30,643 | 4.13% | $1,266 | $19 | **$1,285** |
| **2027** | $32,668 | 4.50% | $1,470 | $44 | **$1,514** |
| **2028** | $34,660 | 4.50% | $1,560 | $53 | **$1,613** |
| **2029** | $36,432 | 4.13% | $1,507 | $55 | **$1,562** |
| **2030** | $38,069 | 3.75% | $1,427 | $53 | **$1,480** |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated using the projected DCF Cash Flow, a Discount Rate (WACC) of **10.5%**, and a Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth) of **1.5%**.

| Year | DCF Cash Flow (M) | Discount Factor (10.5%) | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $532 | 0.905 | $481 |
| **2026** | $1,285 | 0.819 | $1,053 |
| **2027** | $1,514 | 0.741 | $1,121 |
| **2028** | $1,613 | 0.671 | $1,082 |
| **2029** | $1,562 | 0.607 | $948 |
| **2030** | $1,480 | 0.549 | $813 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$5,498** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows beyond 2030, discounted back to 2030.

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{WACC} - \text{Maturity Rate})}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$1,480 \times (1 + 0.015)}{(0.105 - 0.015)} = \frac{\$1,502.2}{0.09} = \$16,691 \text{ M}
$$

#### Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV)

$$
\text{NPV TV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}
$$

$$
\text{NPV TV} = \$16,691 \text{ M} \times 0.549 = \$9,165 \text{ M}
$$

#### Total Enterprise Value (Equity Value)

| Component | Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030) | $5,498 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $9,165 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$14,663** |

***

### V. Fair Value Calculation

The final valuation subtracts the debt and divides by the shares outstanding.

$$
\text{Fair Value} = \frac{(\text{TEV} + \text{Total Cash \& Equivalents}) - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

| Metric | Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Enterprise Value (TEV) | $14,663 |
| **Add:** Total Cash & Equivalents | $3,000 |
| **Subtract:** Total Debt | $(5,341)$ |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$12,322** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 525.19 |
| **FAIR VALUE PER SHARE** | **$23.46** |

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated fair value of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) stock is **\$23.46 per share**.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$23.46** |
| **Current Market Value (Oct 24, 2025)** | **$32.20** |
| **Difference** | **(27.2%) Undervalued** |

#### Justification for Discrepancy

My calculated fair value of **\$23.46** is approximately **27.2% lower** than the current market price of **\$32.20**. This indicates that the market is making more aggressive assumptions about the company's future profitability and growth than my conservative model.

The market's assumptions are likely factoring in one or more of the following:

1.  **More Aggressive Long-Term Profitability (Margin Expansion):** My model assumes a long-term Net Income Margin of **3.75% to 4.5%** over the projection period, peaking in 2027/2028. The market is likely pricing in a return to Southwest's historical pre-pandemic profitability, where Net Income Margins regularly exceeded **7-8%**. If the market assumes an average Net Income Margin of 6.0% for the entire period, the valuation would be significantly higher.
2.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** My very conservative Maturity Rate of **1.5%** is a large drag on valuation (it captures a significant portion of the value). The market may be assuming a higher long-term growth rate of 2.5% to 3.0%, which would imply a long-term growth in the airline's network and ancillary services.
3.  **Lower Cost of Capital (WACC):** My conservative WACC of **10.5%** is high, reflecting the industry's risk. If the market uses a lower cost of capital, perhaps assuming the company's strong brand and balance sheet justify a WACC closer to 8.0%, the NPV would increase substantially.

**My Case for the Conservative Valuation ($23.46):**

The lower fair value is a direct result of a **conservative approach** to the airline industry, which is notoriously cyclical and capital-intensive.

*   **Business Engine Caution:** While the $1.0 billion in new revenue initiatives (assigned seating, bag fees) is transformative, my model is conservative by assuming these benefits are partially offset by inflationary cost pressures (labor contracts, fuel) and market competition. The peak NI margin of 4.5% reflects the new products' benefit but acknowledges the historical reality of the airline sector where sustaining high margins is extremely difficult.
*   **ROIC and WACC:** The company’s historical ROIC is low and often below its WACC. My selection of a conservative ROIC of 3.5% for cash reinvestment, while positive, ensures that future growth is not overvalued based on a weak historical track record of value creation.
*   **Capacity Constraints:** The ongoing challenges with Boeing deliveries and a strategic focus on slow capacity growth (e.g., 1% in 2025) suggests the engine cannot achieve high-single-digit revenue growth in a sustained way, thus justifying the moderate terminal rate.

In summary, the market is assuming a successful and rapid turnaround to higher historical profitability levels, while my valuation is based on a conservative model where the promised transformational benefits are realized, but their long-term value is limited by the structural challenges of the mature airline industry.
