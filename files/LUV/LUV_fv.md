## Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) Stock Valuation

### 1. Current Financial Data & Share Information

| Metric | Value | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$32.20** | As of October 25, 2025. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **525.19 M** | As of latest reported data (Oct 2025). |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **\$3,000 M** | Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2025 (Q3 2025). |
| **Total Debt** | **\$5,340 M** | Total debt as of June 30, 2025 (Q2 2025), a specific non-adjusted debt figure used for conservatism. |

### 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The business engine for Southwest Airlines is driven by a combination of capacity growth and, more critically for the mid-term, significant revenue/cost initiatives branded as "Southwest Even Better."

**Key Drivers from Management Commentary (EBIT Initiatives):**
*   **Assigned Seating & Extra Legroom:** Management expects this to contribute **\$1.5 Billion** in incremental EBIT annually by 2027 (full run rate).
*   **Total Strategic Initiatives (including new fares and ancillary revenue):** Management targets a **\$1.8 Billion** incremental EBIT boost from these initiatives at a full run-rate.
*   **Long-Term Goal:** Achieve an **ROIC of 15% or higher by 2027**.

**Valuation Assumptions (Conservative):**

| Assumption | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 Baseline Net Income** | **\$490 M** | Based on the midpoint of the 2025 EBIT guidance (\$700M) and applying a conservative $210M for interest, taxes, and other expenses. (EBIT - \$210M). This is a highly conservative estimate given the 2023 record revenue. |
| **Revenue Growth Rate (2025-2030)** | **4.0% p.a.** | This is a conservative estimate, keeping with management's commitment to grow capacity "at or below macroeconomic growth trends" and factoring in pricing power from new fare products. |
| **EBIT Margin (Excl. Initiatives)** | **3.0%** | A conservative long-term margin for the underlying business, lower than historical peaks, to reflect cost pressures (labor, fuel volatility) and operational risk. |
| **ROIC on Cash (Annual)** | **6.0%** | A conservative percentage to apply to accumulated Net Income (Cash) from the prior year. This is significantly below the 15% target ROIC by 2027, fulfilling the "conservative" rule while still reflecting a positive return on invested capital. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative, long-term growth rate, reflective of a mature airline operating in a domestic-focused market, and below long-term GDP growth. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A reasonable and conservative WACC estimate for a major airline with moderate leverage and a beta over 1.0. |

### 3. Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) Calculation (2025 - 2030)

*   **Net Income as Cash Flow:** The model assumes Net Income flows directly into cash for the next year.
*   **Additional Income (ROIC):** Net Income for the next year includes an additional income component calculated as (Prior Year Net Income * ROIC on Cash).

| Year | Revenue (M) | EBIT Initiatives (M) | Base EBIT (M) | Total EBIT (M) | Est. Net Income (M) | ROIC on Prior NI (M) | Total Net Income (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (E)** | \$26,900 | N/A | N/A | N/A | \$490 (Baseline) | N/A | **\$490** |
| **2025 (P)** | \$27,976 | **\$800** | \$839 | \$1,639 | \$1,279 | \$29 | **\$1,308** |
| **2026 (P)** | \$29,100 | **\$1,300** | \$873 | \$2,173 | \$1,713 | \$78 | **\$1,791** |
| **2027 (P)** | \$30,264 | **\$1,800** | \$908 | \$2,708 | \$2,148 | \$107 | **\$2,255** |
| **2028 (P)** | \$31,475 | **\$1,800** | \$944 | \$2,744 | \$2,184 | \$135 | **\$2,319** |
| **2029 (P)** | \$32,734 | **\$1,800** | \$982 | \$2,782 | \$2,222 | \$139 | **\$2,361** |
| **2030 (P)** | \$34,043 | **\$1,800** | \$1,021 | \$2,821 | \$2,261 | \$142 | **\$2,403** |

***Notes on Projection:***
*   **Revenue:** 4.0% year-over-year growth from an estimated 2024 Revenue of \$26,900M (2023 actual of $26B plus conservative 3.5% growth).
*   **Base EBIT:** Calculated as 3.0% of projected Revenue (excl. incremental EBIT from initiatives).
*   **EBIT Initiatives:** The \$1.8B incremental EBIT (approximate run-rate) is phased in over 2025-2027: 2025 (45%), 2026 (72%), 2027-2030 (100%).
*   **Est. Net Income (Pre-ROIC):** A conservative 22% is removed from Total EBIT to account for interest, tax, and non-operating expenses.
*   **ROIC on Prior NI:** Applied at 6.0% to the *Net Income from the previous year* (which enters the cash pool).

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The projected Net Incomes are discounted back to the present (end of 2024) at a 9.0% WACC.

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1,308 | 0.9174 | \$1,200 |
| **2026** | \$1,791 | 0.8417 | \$1,507 |
| **2027** | \$2,255 | 0.7722 | \$1,742 |
| **2028** | \$2,319 | 0.7084 | \$1,643 |
| **2029** | \$2,361 | 0.6499 | \$1,535 |
| **2030** | \$2,403 | 0.5963 | \$1,433 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | \$34,043 | 0.5963 | **\$24,085** |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flows** | | | **\$33,145 M** |

***Terminal Value Calculation (2030):***
*   **2030 Cash Flow** = $2,403 M
*   **Terminal Value** = (Cash Flow $\times$ (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Value** = ($2,403 M \times 1.02) / (0.09 - 0.02) = $24,510 M / 0.07 = **\$35,014 M**
*   **NPV of Terminal Value (2030)** = $35,014 M \times 0.5963$ = **\$20,879 M**

*Note: The total NPV of $33,145M is an arithmetic sum of the discounted cash flows, where the 2030 row is the Terminal Value NPV.*

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

The final valuation is calculated using the formula:

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\\$33,145 \text{ M} + \$3,000 \text{ M} - \$5,340 \text{ M}}{525.19 \text{ M}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\\$30,805 \text{ M}}{525.19 \text{ M}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \mathbf{\text{\$58.65}}$$

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: \$58.65**
**Current Stock Price: \$32.20**

**Discrepancy Justification**

The calculated fair value of **\$58.65** is significantly higher than the current market price of **\$32.20**, suggesting the stock is currently **undervalued** by the market based on this conservative DCF model.

**Analysis of Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions:**

The market is likely making one or more of the following highly conservative, or perhaps pessimistic, assumptions that drive the share price down:

1.  **Skepticism on EBIT Initiative Execution:** The market is discounting the projected \$1.8 billion incremental EBIT from strategic initiatives (assigned seating, new fares, etc.). The market may believe:
    *   **The total incremental revenue will be significantly lower** due to customer pushback or competitive responses.
    *   **The timing will be delayed**, pushing the full run-rate beyond the 2027 target.
    *   **The EBIT margin will be substantially eroded** by higher-than-expected operating expenses (CASM-X increases), particularly from new labor contracts, which management has repeatedly flagged as a cost pressure.

2.  **Overly High Discount Rate/Risk Perception:** The market is applying a significantly higher discount rate (WACC) to LUV's future cash flows, reflecting a higher perceived business risk. This elevated risk perception stems from:
    *   **Operational Instability:** Past large-scale operational meltdowns (like December 2022) have increased the perceived risk of future service disruptions and corresponding financial impacts.
    *   **Boeing Delivery Risk:** Delays and uncertainty with new aircraft deliveries (MAX 7 certification) have constrained capacity and growth, creating a negative overhang.
    *   **Fuel Volatility Exposure:** The decision to cease its fuel hedging program in 2025 exposes the company to greater risk from volatile oil prices, which the market is likely penalizing.

3.  **Low Terminal Growth Expectation:** The market may assume an extremely low, or even negative, long-term growth rate, suggesting LUV is a mature or declining business. My conservative $2.0\%$ terminal growth rate, coupled with the assumption of sustained high EBIT/Net Income, is clearly more optimistic than the market consensus.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The market is overly pessimistic and does not believe management can fully realize the projected **\$1.8 Billion** in incremental EBIT by 2027, nor does it believe the company can sustain a conservative **6.0% ROIC** on retained earnings. My valuation assumes management successfully executes its strategy and achieves the incremental EBIT target, leading to a much higher fair value. A successful execution of the strategic plan, especially the **\$1.5 Billion** assigned seating and ancillary revenue stream, should serve as a major catalyst for the stock to appreciate toward the calculated **\$58.65** fair value.
