## II. Business Engine and Future Revenue Assumptions

Southwest's business engine is fundamentally driven by two metrics: **Available Seat Miles (ASMs - Capacity)** and **Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM - Yield)**. The management is actively trying to transform its business model ("Southwest Even Better Plan") to increase RASM through previously avoided methods, while maintaining disciplined capacity.

### Core Assumptions (2025-2030)

| Year | Revenue Driver | Rationale & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **Management Guidance** | Use management's full-year EBIT guidance to determine profitability. |
| **2026** | **Management Target** | Use the highly specific **\$4.3 Billion EBIT target** as stated by management. |
| **2027-2030** | **Capacity (ASM)** | Assuming a conservative long-term average ASM growth of **2.0%** per year, slightly above the low 2025 guidance of ~1% but reflecting a return to normal fleet modernization and market growth in a more stable environment. |
| **2027-2030** | **Yield (RASM)** | Assuming **2.0%** RASM growth, in line with long-term industry inflation and moderate success of "transformational initiatives" (bag fees, assigned seating, new revenue management system). The Q4 2025 guidance of 1-3% RASM growth supports this projection. |

### Projected Revenue (In millions)

| Year | Revenue Projection Formula | Projected Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | \$27,500 |
| **2025** | $\text{Projected NI} / \text{Projected NM (derived from EBIT)}$ | \$27,700 |
| **2026** | $\text{Target EBIT} / \text{Target Operating Margin} = \$4,300 / 15.0\%$ | \$28,667 |
| **2027** | $2026 \text{ Rev} \times (1 + 2.0\% \text{ ASM}) \times (1 + 2.0\% \text{ RASM})$ | \$29,824 |
| **2028** | $2027 \text{ Rev} \times 1.04$ | \$31,017 |
| **2029** | $2028 \text{ Rev} \times 1.04$ | \$32,258 |
| **2030** | $2029 \text{ Rev} \times 1.04$ | \$33,548 |

*Note on 2026 Revenue: The \$4.3B EBIT target is paramount. Based on a historical-to-target operating margin (EBIT/Revenue) for a successful, post-pandemic SWA, a **15.0% Operating Margin** is conservatively used to back-calculate the 2026 Revenue. (4,300 / 0.15 = 28,667). The 4% annual growth for 2027-2030 is derived from 2.0% ASM + 2.0% RASM, which is conservative given the stated growth initiatives.*

## III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

### Margin & Tax Assumptions

1.  **Tax Rate (t):** 23.0% (Midpoint of 2025 guidance of 22% to 24%).
2.  **Net Margin (NM):**
    *   **2025:** Use the mid-point of the **\$600M - \$800M EBIT** guidance (i.e., \$700M).
    *   **2026:** Use the **\$4.3B EBIT target** as guided.
    *   **2027-2030:** A conservative Operating Margin (EBIT/Revenue) of **14.0%** is used. This is less than the back-calculated 15.0% for the major target year 2026, creating a conservative assumption for the out-years.
3.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC - r):** **5.0%** is used. This is a conservative, positive rate, slightly higher than the cited 2.76% normalized historical figure, reflecting the anticipated benefits of the \$500M cost reduction plan and fleet modernization.

### Net Income Calculation (in millions)

$\text{EBIT} = \text{Revenue} \times \text{Operating Margin}$

$\text{Net Income (before ROIC)} = \text{EBIT} \times (1 - t)$

$\text{Net Income (final)} = \text{Net Income (before ROIC)} + (\text{Previous Year's Cash} \times r)$

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Tax (23%) | NI (Before ROIC) | Previous Cash (C) | ROIC Income (C x 5.0%) | **Total Net Income** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$27,500 | 3.5% (EBIT of 979) | \$979 | \$225 | \$754 | N/A | N/A | **\$754** |
| **2025** | \$27,700 | 2.5% (Midpoint of \$700M guidance) | \$700 | \$161 | \$539 | \$754 | \$38 | **\$577** |
| **2026** | \$28,667 | 15.0% (Management Target) | \$4,300 | \$989 | \$3,311 | \$577 | \$29 | **\$3,340** |
| **2027** | \$29,824 | 14.0% | \$4,175 | \$960 | \$3,215 | \$3,340 | \$167 | **\$3,382** |
| **2028** | \$31,017 | 14.0% | \$4,342 | \$999 | \$3,342 | \$3,382 | \$169 | **\$3,511** |
| **2029** | \$32,258 | 14.0% | \$4,516 | \$1,039 | \$3,477 | \$3,511 | \$176 | **\$3,653** |
| **2030** | \$33,548 | 14.0% | \$4,697 | \$1,080 | \$3,617 | \$3,653 | \$183 | **\$3,800** |

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for this DCF calculation.

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (k):** **9.0%** (Conservative WACC/Cost of Equity for a stable, investment-grade airline.)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%** (Conservative maturity rate, roughly equal to long-term US GDP/inflation).

### DCF Calculation (in millions)

| Year | Total Net Income (FCFE) | Discount Factor ($\frac{1}{(1+k)^t}$) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$577 | $1 / 1.09^1 = 0.917$ | \$529 |
| **2026** | \$3,340 | $1 / 1.09^2 = 0.842$ | \$2,812 |
| **2027** | \$3,382 | $1 / 1.09^3 = 0.772$ | \$2,610 |
| **2028** | \$3,511 | $1 / 1.09^4 = 0.708$ | \$2,487 |
| **2029** | \$3,653 | $1 / 1.09^5 = 0.650$ | \$2,374 |
| **2030** | \$3,800 | $1 / 1.09^6 = 0.596$ | \$2,263 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **\$13,075** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{k - g}$

$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$3,800 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$3,876}{0.07} = \$55,371$ million

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV):**

$\text{NPV TV} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$

$\text{NPV TV} = \$55,371 \times 0.596 = \$33,029$ million

### Total Equity Value

$\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Sum of NPV (2025-2030)} + \text{NPV TV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$

$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$13,075 + \$33,029 + \$3,000 - \$6,700$

$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$45,404$ million

## V. Fair Value Calculation and Conclusion

### Fair Value per Share

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$45,404,000,000}{517,155,000}$

$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$87.79$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$87.79** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$42.03** |

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated **Fair Value of \$87.79** is significantly higher than the **Current Market Price of \$42.03**. This suggests that the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Southwest's business future than the projections based on management's stated goals.

The primary reason for this large discrepancy lies in the management's **\$4.3 billion EBIT target for 2026** and the subsequent margin assumption.

**Market's Implied Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions:**

| Assumption | Valuation Model (Optimistic/Management-Driven) | Market's Implied Assumption (Pessimistic) | Why the difference? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 EBIT** | \$4.3 billion (Management Target) | Likely assumes a much lower EBIT, perhaps closer to \$1.5B - \$2.0B. | The market is discounting management's ability to execute on the "Southwest Even Better Plan," particularly the revenue management, assigned seating, and cost-reduction initiatives. The market still sees SWA as struggling with its traditional low-fare/no-frills model in a post-pandemic, differentiated-product world. |
| **Long-Term Margin** | 14.0% Operating Margin (2027-2030) | Likely assumes a lower Operating Margin, closer to the 2024-2025 low single-digit levels, due to perennial cost inflation (CASM-X pressure) and limited pricing power. | Past operational meltdowns and persistent cost pressures, coupled with a history of underperformance in 2024 and 2025, lead the market to believe the cost base is structurally higher than management projects. |
| **Perpetual Growth** | 2.0% (Stable/Inflationary) | Likely a much lower growth rate, or a higher Discount Rate, reflecting perceived structural risks (e.g., reliance on a single aircraft type - Boeing 737, competitive pressure, labor disputes). | The single-model fleet strategy is now a liability (Boeing delivery issues), and the market is pricing in a higher risk premium (higher discount rate) and slower, more volatile long-term growth. |

**Conclusion:**

The valuation of **\$87.79** is based on taking the **management's explicit, transformative targets (especially the \$4.3B 2026 EBIT target) as truth**, coupled with conservative yet positive long-term growth and a modest capital efficiency (ROIC). The market price of **\$42.03** suggests that investors **do not believe** management will achieve this transformation and are pricing the stock based on a continuation of the much lower, volatile earnings seen in 2024 and 2025.

An investor buying at the current price of \$42.03 is essentially betting that Southwest will fail to execute its plan, while a buyer at \$87.79 is fully convinced of management's capabilities to meet or exceed its 2026 target and sustain a mid-teens operating margin thereafter. **The Fair Value is highly sensitive to the 2026 EBIT assumption.**
