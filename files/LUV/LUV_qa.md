## Business Summary

Southwest Airlines operates using a low-cost, point-to-point business model, meaning its planes fly directly between cities rather than routing passengers through large, central hubs. This structure, combined with its practice of utilizing almost exclusively one type of aircraft (the Boeing 737), greatly simplifies maintenance, training, and scheduling, which keeps operating costs low. Its primary customers are price-sensitive travelers, including both individuals flying for leisure and those traveling for business, predominantly within the United States. Southwest generates nearly all of its revenue from ticket sales, often appealing to customers by including popular perks, such as two free checked bags, that competitors charge extra fees for.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant immediate threat to Southwest's earnings is the volatility of jet fuel prices; sudden increases in fuel cost, which is the airline's largest operating expense, can quickly erode profit margins. This has historically been a major issue during periods of geopolitical instability. A second near-term risk arises from the company’s heavy reliance on the Boeing 737 aircraft family; if this specific type of plane encounters manufacturing defects or regulatory issues, as occurred with the 737 MAX grounding, the entire airline’s operation can be severely impacted, forcing canceled flights and damaging its market position. Long term, Southwest faces intense competition as rival airlines copy its low-cost strategies and service offerings. Furthermore, as a heavily unionized company, labor disputes pose a constant operational risk, potentially leading to increased costs or flight delays that could threaten the company's reputation for reliable service.

***

## The History of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV): Inception to Present Day

### The Spark: Why Southwest Airlines Was Founded

1.  **The "Texas Triangle" Idea:** Southwest Airlines was originally conceived in 1966 by Rollin King, a businessman and pilot, and his lawyer, Herb Kelleher, who would become the company's legendary CEO. They reportedly sketched the initial concept—a triangle connecting Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio—on a cocktail napkin.
2.  **The Goal to "Democratize the Sky":** Their primary goal was to offer a frequent, short-haul airline service at very low fares, making air travel affordable and accessible for the general public, rather than just the wealthy or business elite.
3.  **Bypassing Federal Control (Initial Tail Wind):** At the time, the federal government tightly controlled routes and ticket prices for interstate airlines. By choosing to fly only *within* the state of Texas (intrastate), Southwest could set its own low fares and schedules.

### Problems Faced Across the Way: The Early Years (1967–1978)

4.  **The Four-Year Legal Battle (Headwind):** Before the first flight, major established airlines fought intensely to stop Southwest from entering the market, leading to a four-year legal battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
5.  **A Winning Low-Cost Strategy (Innovative Solution):** To beat its rivals, Southwest developed its now-famous operational model:
    *   **The Point-to-Point System:** Unlike major airlines which used a "hub-and-spoke" system (flying everything through a central airport for connections), Southwest flew directly between cities, reducing delays and costs.
    *   **The "10-Minute Turn":** They focused on getting the aircraft unloaded, cleaned, and re-boarded in an astonishingly quick time (targeting around 10–25 minutes), ensuring the plane spent more time in the air earning revenue.
    *   **Single Aircraft Fleet:** They chose to use only one type of aircraft—the Boeing 737—which drastically reduced costs for maintenance, spare parts, and pilot training, as a pilot could fly any plane in the fleet.
6.  **The Start and the Name:** Southwest finally took its first flight in 1971 and was headquartered at Dallas Love Field, which inspired its stock ticker symbol, **LUV**, and its fun, friendly, "love-themed" marketing.

### Growth and Major Tailwinds (1978–2000s)

7.  **The Great Tail Wind of Deregulation:** The U.S. Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 removed federal restrictions on routes and fares, allowing Southwest to take its successful low-cost model and expand nationally without facing the same constant legal opposition.
8.  **Pioneering Technology and Policy (Innovative Solutions):** In 1995, Southwest was the first major airline to introduce **ticketless travel** (using a confirmation number instead of a paper ticket), which further lowered their operating costs. They also introduced the innovative policy of **free checked bags** and **no change fees** (a policy largely maintained to this day), differentiating them as the customer-friendly low-fare option.
9.  **The Fuel Hedging Advantage (A Major Tailwind):** Beginning in the 1990s, Southwest developed a shrewd strategy known as "fuel hedging," where they secured large amounts of future jet fuel at a fixed price. This protected the company from severe price spikes that crippled competitors, notably after 9/11 and during the 2008 oil price volatility, allowing Southwest to remain consistently profitable.
10. **The Employee-First Culture (Core Solution):** Southwest’s innovative edge extends to its corporate culture, which is based on an "Employee-first" ethos, encouraging employees to have fun, work as a team, and treat each other with respect. This high employee morale translated into the famous "Southwest Hospitality" that improved customer service and operational flexibility.

### Modern Headwinds and Transformation (2019–Present)

11. **The Boeing 737 MAX Grounding (Headwind):** The company’s innovative single-aircraft strategy became a major risk in 2019 when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all Boeing 737 MAX planes globally for safety concerns. As the largest operator of the MAX, the grounding hit Southwest’s operational efficiency and growth plans particularly hard.
12. **The 2022 Holiday Meltdown (Major Headwind/Failure):** A severe winter storm exposed a major weakness: decades-old crew scheduling and logistics software that couldn't handle real-time disruptions. This led to a catastrophic failure, causing over 16,700 canceled flights and stranding millions of travelers.
13. **Modernization & Transformation (Solution):** In response to the meltdown, the company committed over a billion dollars to a major IT infrastructure overhaul to modernize its systems and improve operational resilience.
14. **Current Strategic Shifts:** Today, the company is changing its model by investing in new technology, expanding international routes, and, most notably, moving away from its famous open seating policy to introduce **assigned seating** in 2026 to keep up with industry standards and customer demand for more choices.

The ultimate goal of Southwest Airlines remains what it was in 1971: to be the world’s most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline by connecting people to what’s important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) is a unique combination of deeply entrenched, nearly 50-year-old operational efficiencies and a highly differentiated, customer-centric product offering.

### 1. Competitive Advantage and Differentiation

The core of Southwest's moat is its **low-cost structure**, which allows it to profitably offer low fares while its competitors struggle to match.

*   **Pioneering Low-Cost Model:** Southwest originated and perfected the "Low-Cost Carrier" (LCC) business model in the U.S. aviation industry, which has been its foundational strategy since its founding.
*   **Operational Simplicity:** The airline operates a fleet composed almost entirely of a single aircraft type (the Boeing 737). This significantly simplifies and reduces costs for maintenance, spare parts, pilot training, and scheduling.
*   **Point-to-Point Network:** Unlike "hub-and-spoke" legacy carriers, Southwest uses a point-to-point route structure, often utilizing less-congested, lower-cost secondary or downtown airports. This allows for quicker aircraft turnaround times and higher daily aircraft utilization.

### 2. Pricing Power and Market Position

Southwest does not have typical pricing power to demand higher prices, but it has a dominant position that allows it to set the floor for competition.

*   **Price Leadership:** Southwest's efficient cost structure grants it the ability to consistently be one of the lowest-cost providers, a position often described as cost leadership.
*   **The "Southwest Effect":** Its entry into a new market typically causes competing airlines to lower their fares, a phenomenon known as the "Southwest Effect." This proves its market power in setting pricing dynamics on specific routes.
*   **Unique Product Mix:** The airline occupies a unique market position by combining ultra-low operational costs with generous customer policies (free checked bags, no change fees), differentiating it from both legacy airlines and ultra-low-cost carriers.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Contracts

The company’s differentiation is built into its product, creating significant customer loyalty and recurrence.

*   **No-Fee Policies:** The policy of allowing two free checked bags and having no change fees for flight modifications removes a major source of friction and cost for travelers, making the service stickier than fee-heavy competitors.
*   **Frequent Flyer Program (Rapid Rewards):** The loyalty program is a primary driver of repeat business, which is further enhanced by the new policy that flight credits never expire.
*   **Brand Loyalty and "Culture":** Southwest has cultivated a strong, distinctive brand and corporate culture known for its "Hospitality" and friendly service, which translates into high customer satisfaction and a loyal, devoted customer base.

### 4. Difficulty of Displacement and Capital Requirements

Southwest is difficult to displace because its competitive advantages are integrated across its entire operational system, not just a single asset or technology.

*   **Complex System to Replicate:** A competitor with more capital would not simply be able to copy the model because Southwest's advantages are interlocking: the single fleet enables the fast turnaround, which enables the low fares, which are supported by the unique corporate culture.
*   **First-Mover and Scale Advantage:** The company is an established market leader in domestic flights and has a strong domestic network, which acts as a formidable barrier to entry.
*   **Financial Strength:** Southwest has historically maintained a strong balance sheet compared to many competitors, providing financial flexibility to weather economic downturns and invest strategically.

### 5. Innovation and Future Moat Strategies

Southwest is not an R&D-heavy company in the traditional sense, but its historical strength lies in **process innovation** and is now focused on significant technology modernization.

*   **Process Innovation Pioneer:** The company’s original innovation was its operational strategy—pioneering the low-cost model, point-to-point flying, and the concept of a 10-minute gate turnaround.
*   **Technology Modernization:** To sustain its moat, the company is making major investments, including a recent \$1.7 billion commitment to technology in 2024 for projects like cloud migration, which is critical to fixing operational bottlenecks and improving the customer experience.
*   **Strategic Investments:** Southwest is also investing in areas like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through companies like LanzaJet to manage long-term operational costs and environmental risk.

## Catalyst Analysis

Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) is currently undergoing a significant business model transformation, with its catalysts centered on capturing new revenue streams, improving efficiency, and returning capital to shareholders.

### Near-Term Catalysts (6-12 Months)

1.  **Monetizing New Product Offerings:** The recent introduction of new revenue initiatives, such as bag fees, a "basic economy" fare option, and newly introduced assigned and extra legroom seating, is expected to drive significant revenue growth. Management is forecasting a substantial increase in Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM) for the first quarter of the year, expecting a rise of at least 9.5%.
2.  **Operational Excellence and Reliability:** Maintaining an industry-leading operational performance, such as being ranked the top U.S. airline by the Wall Street Journal for 2025, builds customer trust and reduces costly disruptions. The company's focus on efficiency, including reduced turn times and new redeye flights, is already increasing aircraft use with a flat fleet size.
3.  **Shareholder Return Program:** The ongoing plan to return capital through an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program is an immediate positive catalyst. In 2025, the company returned $2.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

### Long-Term Catalysts (1+ Years)

1.  **Aggressive 2026 Earnings Target:** The primary long-term catalyst is the management's ambitious target to achieve an adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of at least \$4.00 for the full fiscal year 2026. This goal, which represents a massive increase from the prior year's adjusted EPS, signals confidence in the long-term profitability of the ongoing transformation.
2.  **Full Realization of Strategic Transformation:** The complete payoff from the business model overhaul—which includes changes to the loyalty program, new online distribution partnerships, and technology improvements—is expected to fully materialize by 2026. CEO Bob Jordan specifically called this the "most ambitious transformation in Company history" and stated that the \$4.00 EPS guidance is at the "lower end of our internal forecast."
3.  **Sustained Cost Control and Margin Expansion:** The company has outperformed its cost-reduction targets, which, when combined with new high-margin revenue streams, should lead to significant margin expansion and stronger long-term profitability. Management expects 2026 to be a year of "significant margin expansion and earnings growth."

---

## Management Record

The management of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) is currently undergoing a significant transformation under the leadership of its new CEO, Bob Jordan, which is critical for investors to understand.

### **Current Management: Bob Jordan Era (CEO since Feb 2022)**

1.  **CEO Background and History:** Bob Jordan is a 37-year veteran of Southwest, having held 15 different leadership roles in Finance, Technology, and Strategy, including a key role in the acquisition of AirTran Airways. This deep institutional knowledge positioned his succession as a planned continuity of Southwest's culture.
2.  **Performance and Track Record (Mixed):** Jordan's early tenure was marked by the massive operational failure in late 2022 (nearly 17,000 canceled flights), which exposed the company's outdated technology and scheduling systems. However, the company reported record annual revenue and EBIT for the full year 2025 and ranked No. 1 in on-time performance that year, exceeding its own guidance.
3.  **Shareholder Value and Compensation:** His compensation increased substantially in 2023, following the 2022 meltdown, tied to performance metrics in finances and operations, and the company completed a significant stock repurchase program in 2025. This suggests a management focus on financial performance post-crisis.
4.  **Future Strategy and Vision (The "Transformation"):** Jordan is leading the largest transformation in Southwest's 54-year history to modernize the airline, lower costs, and improve financial returns. Key initiatives include introducing assigned seating, a new reservations system, premium seating, a new loyalty program structure, and adding redeye flying routes.
5.  **Financial Delivery on Promises:** These revenue initiatives are projected by management to generate significant incremental EBIT for 2025 and 2026, which is an explicit promise for shareholder value creation.

### **Previous Management and Board Change**

1.  **Previous CEO and Track Record:** Gary C. Kelly served as CEO for 18 years (2004–2022), leading the airline through challenges like the 9/11 aftermath and the AirTran acquisition, while maintaining its unique employee-focused culture. He transitioned to Executive Chairman until late 2024.
2.  **Reason for Management/Board Change:** The management and board saw significant changes due to pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. Elliott argued that management was responsible for the stock price dropping by over half in three years and pushed for changes to enhance financial performance.
3.  **Board Refreshment:** The pressure from Elliott led to the accelerated retirement of Gary Kelly as Executive Chairman and the departure of six other directors, resulting in the appointment of new, independent board members. This indicates a shareholder-driven push for increased accountability and a fresh perspective on corporate governance.

### **Corporate Vision and Culture**

1.  **Vision Statement:** Southwest’s vision is "to be the world's most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline," which is a triple-crown ambition guiding its long-term strategy.
2.  **Mission and Core Values:** The mission focuses on providing the public with low fares and great Customer Service. The unique "Southwest Culture" is championed by Jordan and is built on core values such as a "Warrior Spirit, Servant's Heart, and Fun-LUVing Attitude."

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Southwest Airlines Co.'s (LUV) recent DEF 14A proxy statement filings, the management incentive and compensation structure is generally designed to align with shareholder interests, primarily through a heavy reliance on equity compensation.

### **Insider Ownership and Stock Alignment**

1.  **Stock Ownership Guidelines:** Southwest Airlines has a policy that requires directors and executive officers to hold a financial stake in the Company to align their interests with shareholders.
2.  **Managerial Holdings:** While the aggregate percentage of beneficial ownership by all directors and executive officers is not a large controlling stake, the existence of formal stock ownership guidelines demonstrates a corporate commitment to long-term alignment.
3.  **Equity-Focused Pay:** The compensation structure reinforces stock alignment, as a significant majority of the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation for 2024 was comprised of Equity, indicating a strong emphasis on Long-Term Incentives (LTI).

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

4.  **Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:** The overall objective of the compensation program is explicitly to provide fair pay opportunities while aligning them with the Company’s business objectives and priorities, emphasizing a strong "pay-for-performance philosophy."
5.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus:** The Compensation Committee's strategy is heavily weighted toward LTI opportunities, which typically vest over multiple years and tie directly to stock price appreciation, encouraging management to focus on sustainable, long-term shareholder value creation.
6.  **Performance Metrics:** Variable pay, including the Annual Incentive Program (AIP) and LTI awards, is tied to performance metrics such as financial results, operational goals, and execution of key strategic initiatives designed to deliver shareholder value.
7.  **Clawback Policies:** The company's governance includes consideration of clawback policies for unearned executive pay, which serves as a safeguard against managerial misconduct or egregious financial restatements, further protecting shareholder capital.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

8.  **Incentive Alignment:** The structure is predominantly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, as the largest component of executive pay is stock-based (LTI), which directly rises or falls with the Company's stock price and long-term shareholder returns.
9.  **Risk Mitigation:** The use of both financial and operational metrics, combined with an established policy for executive stock ownership and a high proportion of LTI, suggests a design intended to mitigate short-term excessive risk-taking and focus on sustainable value creation.

## Long Thesis

Southwest Airlines is fundamentally strengthening its business by implementing the largest transformation in its history. This effort leverages its foundational competitive advantage—its simple, low-cost operations—and overlays it with new ways to make money, addressing a long-standing critique that the airline was under-monetizing its customer base. Near term, new product offerings like premium seating and basic economy fares are immediately boosting ticket revenue. Long term, a multi-billion dollar investment in modernizing its dated computer systems, combined with the full rollout of these new pricing models (including assigned seating), will allow Southwest to achieve significant margin expansion and hit management's ambitious goal of high earnings per share by 2026. The airline is evolving from a static, reliable carrier into a high-growth profit engine that maintains its cost advantage while expanding profitability through modern revenue strategies.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. **Successful Execution:** Management successfully implements its complex, company-wide technology and business transformation (such as new reservation systems and assigned seating) without major operational meltdowns or delays. 2. **Customer Acceptance:** The introduction of new, slightly less customer-friendly policies (like different fare types and assigned seating) does not significantly alienate the loyal customer base, and travelers continue to value Southwest’s unique offerings (free bags, no change fees). 3. **Economic Stability:** The broad U.S. economy remains stable, and travel demand, especially for leisure and short-haul business trips, continues to grow. 4. **Cost Control:** The company continues to effectively manage its fuel expenses, either through shrewd hedging or stable market prices, preventing rapid cost spikes from eroding the new revenue gains.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis makes a strong case for revenue expansion but fails to fully account for the associated increase in operational complexity, cost, and risk of brand erosion. The core flaw is the risk of the transformation degrading Southwest's "low-cost" foundational advantage before new revenue fully offsets the rising costs and potential customer defection.

Here are the flaws and faults in the long thesis assumptions:

### Bear Case Thesis: The Costly Commoditization of the Southwest Brand

Southwest's transformation risks becoming a costly transition that results in a commoditized product with legacy-level complexity but without a commensurate network or premium offering. The multi-billion dollar investment in modernization and new product complexity will erode its historic low-cost advantage, as evidenced by rising CASM-X (Cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel). This complexity, combined with significant fleet delays from Boeing, will restrain capacity growth and prevent the company from fully realizing its ambitious high-margin and high-EPS targets for 2026, leading to downward revisions and underperformance relative to legacy carriers with stronger network moats.

---

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

#### 1. Flaw in Assumption: "Leveraging its... low-cost operations"

*   **Erosion of Cost Advantage:** The implementation of complex new products like tiered seating, varied fare classes, and updated IT systems inherently increases operational complexity and costs. Recent financial data showed an increase in CASM-X (cost per available seat mile, ex-fuel) in both the full year prior and the subsequent quarter forecast, directly challenging the assumption that the "simple, low-cost operations" will be maintained.
*   **Costly Infrastructure Overhaul:** A multi-billion-dollar investment in "modernizing its dated computer systems" represents a massive, non-recurring cost and a multi-year effort that will weigh heavily on capital expenditures before the full revenue benefit is recognized. Major technology transformations carry an extreme risk of overruns, delays, and critical operational failure, potentially dwarfing the initial investment.

#### 2. Flaw in Assumption: "Successful Execution... without major operational meltdowns or delays"

*   **Boeing Delivery Delays & Constrained Growth:** The planned "high-growth profit engine" is fundamentally constrained by fewer-than-anticipated aircraft deliveries from Boeing, compounded by the ongoing delay in the certification of the 737 MAX 7. This forces Southwest to cut planned capacity, hindering the expansion needed to maximize revenue from the new pricing models and making the aggressive 2026 EPS goal harder to hit.
*   **Operational Risk of Dual Transformation:** Simultaneously rolling out a complete IT systems modernization (reservation and revenue management) *and* an overhaul of the customer-facing boarding process (assigned seating) represents an extreme execution risk. The company has a history of major operational disruption from IT system failures, and integrating complex new pricing/seating logic into an outdated backbone increases the risk of a significant operational meltdown.

#### 3. Flaw in Assumption: "Customer Acceptance... does not significantly alienate the loyal customer base"

*   **Brand Commoditization:** Introducing assigned seating and "basic economy" (which restricts the "no change fees" and "free bags" benefits) eliminates the core "anti-airline" differentiators that built the loyal Southwest customer base over five decades. By adopting the fee structure and processes of legacy carriers, Southwest risks becoming a generic airline that is less distinctive, which could lead to customer defection toward either cheaper Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers (ULCCs) or higher-service legacy airlines.
*   **Revenue Initiative Effectiveness:** While new products are expected to boost ticket revenue, the actual growth rate must be substantial to outpace rising costs. Full-year net profit was lower year-over-year in a recent reporting period, suggesting that the initial ancillary revenue gains are not yet translating into clear bottom-line profit growth, indicating the revenue lift is slower or less impactful than investors hoped.

#### 4. Flaw in Assumption: "Cost Control... effectively manage its fuel expenses"

*   **Over-Reliance on External Costs:** Recent profitability has been heavily supported by a significant drop in fuel expenses. If global oil prices or hedging costs rise, the new, structurally higher CASM-X will be exacerbated, rapidly eroding the new revenue gains and pressuring margins that depend on favorable external pricing.
*   **Increasing Labor Headwinds:** The labor market for airlines remains tight, and a recent earnings report listed "the impact of labor matters" as a key risk. Since labor is a massive component of airline costs, any new expensive contracts could immediately negate the benefits of the new fare strategies.

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis you've completed, the central investment question boils down to whether the **Transformation** (new revenue) can successfully and sustainably outpace the **Execution Risk** (rising costs, Boeing delays, brand erosion).

The search results already provided a good start to quantifying the risks and rewards. Here are the most important questions still left unanswered and the next investigative steps you should take to pressure-test the $\$4.00$ EPS target.

### Next Steps to Investigate for Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)

1.  **Test the Full-Year Cost Guidance (CASM-X):**
    *   The bear case highlights rising costs, but the search only provided Q1 2026 guidance (up 3.5% year-over-year). You need the **full-year 2026 CASM-X guidance** from management to directly evaluate whether the low-cost structure is truly being preserved or eroding over the entire year.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Southwest Airlines full year 2026 CASM-X guidance" or the Q4 2025 earnings transcript for the full-year outlook.

2.  **Evaluate Long-Term Brand and Customer Loyalty Impact:**
    *   The bear case strongly argues that new policies will alienate loyal customers. Find independent, third-party data on customer response since the new changes (assigned seating, basic economy) began in late January 2026.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Southwest Airlines assigned seating customer reviews" or "Southwest brand loyalty impact assigned seating."

3.  **Quantify the IT Overhaul Investment and Timetable:**
    *   The bear case cites a "multi-billion dollar investment" in IT, which is a major capital expenditure risk. You need the specific, updated total dollar commitment and a milestone schedule (e.g., when the new reservations system is *fully* deployed and operational).
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Southwest Airlines IT modernization budget and completion date" or "Southwest Airlines new reservations system timeline."

4.  **Confirm the New Independent Board Leadership:**
    *   The management section mentioned an independent chairman would be appointed after the Elliott settlement, but did not name the person. The identity and background of the new independent Chairman will determine the level of financial and operational accountability on the board.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Southwest Airlines new independent chairman" to confirm who was appointed to lead the board post-settlement.

5.  **Analyze the Labor Cost Headwind:**
    *   The bear case noted "increasing labor headwinds" as a major cost risk. Investigate the status of any significant pending union contracts (e.g., Pilots, Flight Attendants, Mechanics) and the estimated impact of potential new contracts on the 2026-2027 CASM-X outlook.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Southwest Airlines pending labor contracts" or "Southwest Airlines pilot contract cost impact."

6.  **Assess Long-Term Capacity and Boeing Dependency:**
    *   While you have the 2026 MAX 7 certification timeline (expected August 2026, entry into service early 2027), the risk of *further* delay remains. Monitor Boeing's overall production rate and any new regulatory issues impacting the MAX family to assess the risk of capacity constraint extending into 2027 and beyond.
    *   *Next Step:* Search for "Boeing 737 MAX production rate FAA oversight update" and "Southwest Airlines 2027 fleet plan."
