## Business Summary

Southwest Airlines operates primarily as a major low-cost airline focused exclusively on domestic travel within the United States. The core of their business model, known as the Low-Cost Carrier (LCC) strategy, is built on extreme efficiency, enabling them to offer lower base fares than traditional airlines. They achieve this efficiency by using only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737, which simplifies maintenance, training, and scheduling. Southwest flies point-to-point rather than routing passengers through large hubs, which generally increases aircraft usage and reduces delays. Their customers are broadly distributed across the US, appealing to both cost-sensitive leisure travelers and business travelers who value frequent, direct service and the perk of free checked baggage. Nearly all revenue comes from passenger ticket sales, supplemented by fees for priority boarding services.

## Business Model Risk

The airline faces constant near-term risks centered on operating costs and system stability. Since jet fuel is one of the largest operational expenses, sharp increases in fuel prices can immediately and severely cut into profits; this is a historical risk that recurs whenever global oil prices spike. Operational fragility, particularly relying on aging IT and scheduling systems, is a critical near-term threat, as demonstrated by the massive flight cancellation event in late 2022 that caused huge financial losses and harmed brand trust. Long-term risks include escalating labor costs, as the highly unionized workforce frequently negotiates for higher wages. Furthermore, the company's commitment to only flying the Boeing 737 model poses a structural risk; if Boeing faces manufacturing delays or safety issues (as occurred with the 737 MAX grounding), Southwest cannot easily switch its fleet or expand its routes, harming its long-term market position.

## Company History

This history is designed to give you a detailed, jargon-free understanding of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), often simply called Southwest.

### The History of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)

#### I. Inception and The Founding Goal

1.  **The Idea:** Southwest Airlines was founded by attorney Herb Kelleher and businessman Rollin King, who reportedly sketched the original concept on a cocktail napkin in a bar in 1967.
2.  **The Original Goal (Why it was founded):** The vision was to create a new, affordable travel option for Texans by flying between the three major cities: Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio—the "Texas Triangle."
3.  **The Strategy:** By operating only within the state of Texas, the company could avoid the high prices and strict control over routes and fares imposed by the federal government at the time. This allowed them to offer significantly lower fares than established carriers.
4.  **The Mission:** The company’s core purpose from the start was to "democratize the sky," making air travel accessible and affordable for everyone, especially for people who would otherwise drive.

---

#### II. Early Headwinds and The Core Innovation

5.  **Headwind (The Legal Battle):** Before its first flight, three major established airlines immediately sued Southwest to stop it from operating, leading to a three-year legal battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
6.  **Innovative Solution (Winning the Right to Fly):** Southwest prevailed in court in 1970 and launched its first flights in 1971, which solidified the company's early identity as a rebellious underdog fighting for the consumer.
7.  **Core Operational Innovation (The Model):** To keep costs low enough to make money with low fares, Southwest pioneered a disruptive low-cost carrier model based on efficiency:
    *   **Single Aircraft Fleet:** They chose to fly only one type of plane, the Boeing 737. This drastically simplifies maintenance, reduces the inventory of spare parts, and requires pilots and mechanics to be trained on only one aircraft.
    *   **Point-to-Point Routes:** Instead of the traditional "hub-and-spoke" system (where all flights go through a large, main hub airport), Southwest uses a **point-to-point** system, flying directly between cities. This reduces delays caused by a problem at one hub and improves aircraft use.
    *   **Quick Turnarounds:** They became known for getting planes back in the air very quickly after landing (sometimes in 25 minutes), maximizing the time the plane is flying and earning revenue.

---

#### III. A Major Tailwind and Strategic Innovations

8.  **Major Tailwind (The Deregulation Act):** The **Airline Deregulation Act of 1978** removed federal control over airline fares and routes nationwide. This was a massive tailwind for Southwest because their low-cost structure, originally designed to beat regulation, was now the perfect business model for a new, highly competitive national market.
9.  **Industry Headwinds (Competitors Fail):** In the decades following deregulation, many established "legacy" carriers struggled, went bankrupt, or were forced to merge. Southwest, with its efficient, proven model, began a period of sustained growth and profitability.
10. **Financial Innovation (Fuel Hedging):** In the 2000s, as oil prices soared, Southwest implemented an aggressive **fuel hedging** strategy, using financial contracts to lock in future fuel prices at a much lower cost than their rivals. This provided a significant competitive advantage and kept their costs stable while other airlines struggled.
11. **Customer-Focused Innovation:** They established key customer-friendly policies that differentiate them to this day: no fees for changing a flight reservation and historically, not charging for the first two checked bags, making the overall cost of flying lower and more transparent.

---

#### IV. Navigating Crises and The Modern Challenge

12. **Headwind (9/11 Attacks):** The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were a severe blow to the entire airline industry. While many competitors laid off staff and faced bankruptcy, Southwest's strong financial health and culture allowed them to commit to **no layoffs**, maintain all employees, and offer full refunds to all customers.
13. **Headwind (The 2022 Holiday Meltdown):** In late 2022, a major winter storm exposed a severe vulnerability: the company's outdated crew scheduling technology. The system failed, causing an operational collapse that led to over 15,000 cancellations, resulting in huge losses and a record fine from the government.
14. **Innovative Solution (Modern Transformation):** In response, Southwest has committed to a significant technology overhaul to modernize its operations and prevent future systemic failures.
15. **Recent Business Model Change:** By 2026, Southwest is phasing out its long-held "open seating" policy for assigned seating and adding a premium, extra-legroom seating section. This shift, driven by customer research on longer flights, aims to modernize the customer experience and generate more revenue to meet modern financial pressures.

---

#### V. Present Day Goal

16. **Current Status:** Southwest Airlines is one of the largest domestic carriers in the United States, carrying more nonstop air travelers than any other U.S. airline, serving over 100 destinations in the U.S. and near-international countries.
17. **The Enduring Goal:** The company's goal remains centered on offering a unique combination of **value and Hospitality**. It aims to be a reliable, low-cost carrier, supported by its famously dedicated workforce, while adapting its original no-frills model to meet evolving customer expectations in a hyper-competitive market.

## Moat Analysis

The moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, of Southwest Airlines (LUV) is historically rooted in a powerful combination of a unique, ultra-efficient low-cost operating model and a differentiated, customer-friendly service model. This blend is often difficult for competitors to copy without fundamentally restructuring their own systems.

Here is an analysis of Southwest's moat and differentiation:

### **1. The Foundational Cost Moat: Operational Efficiency**

1.  **Single-Fleet Simplicity:** Southwest exclusively operates Boeing 737 aircraft, which is its most significant cost advantage. This standardization drastically simplifies crew training, maintenance procedures, and spare parts inventory, leading to lower operating expenses than competitors who run a mixed fleet.
2.  **Rapid Turnarounds:** The airline uses a point-to-point route structure rather than the legacy carriers' hub-and-spoke model, allowing it to bypass congested major hubs and operate from less-expensive, secondary airports. This efficiency, combined with its simple boarding process, allows for exceptionally fast aircraft turnarounds (often under 30 minutes), meaning each plane spends more time flying and generating revenue.
3.  **Low Operating Costs:** By minimizing frills like assigned seating, in-flight meals, and relying heavily on direct online bookings, Southwest maintains a fundamentally lower cost base. This focus allows it to offer lower base fares than many competitors while remaining profitable.

### **2. Special Pricing Power and Market Position**

4.  **Cost-Based Pricing Power:** Southwest's rigorously managed low-cost structure is the source of its pricing power, allowing it to consistently offer competitive fares. It doesn't have true "special pricing power" to charge a premium over a competitor's identical route, but it has the power to consistently *underprice* legacy carriers while maintaining better margins.
5.  **Transparent Value Proposition:** Its historically simple fare structure with no change fees and the unique "Bags Fly Free" policy (two checked bags free) created a special position in the market. This transparency built significant trust and attracted price-sensitive travelers, differentiating it sharply from rivals who rely heavily on ancillary fees.
6.  **Dominant Route Position:** Southwest has achieved a very strong, dominant market share (historically 80–90%) in many of its top city-pair routes, giving it an undeniable strategic position in those specific local markets.

### **3. Customer Stickiness and Displacement Risk**

7.  **Sticky Customer Contracts/Loyalty:** The customer loyalty is driven by the transparency of its pricing (no hidden fees) and its flexible, customer-friendly policies (like the restriction-free Rapid Rewards program). This creates a recurring customer base who prefer the convenience and value over the complexity of other airlines.
8.  **The Cultural Moat (Intangible Asset):** The company’s growth was driven by a legendary corporate culture focused on employee satisfaction, historically committing to no layoffs. This "Southwest Spirit" translates to exceptional, friendly customer service, which is a powerful, difficult-to-replicate intangible asset that builds long-term customer affinity.
9.  **Displacement by Capital is Difficult:** The operational efficiency and unique culture are deeply embedded over decades, making it extremely hard for a competitor with "more capital" to simply replicate the success overnight. A new airline could buy the same planes, but it would take years and billions to build an equally efficient operational system and the distinct, high-morale employee culture.

### **4. Network Effects, R&D, and Innovation**

10. **Network and Scale Advantage:** The extensive coverage of its point-to-point network gives it a scale advantage, as adding new routes strengthens the utility of the existing network for travelers. While not a classic digital network effect, its size and route density on the single 737 fleet create an operational scale advantage that lowers per-unit costs.
11. **Innovation Focus (Operational):** Southwest's innovation has historically been centered on the business model, not traditional Research & Development (R&D). Its innovations were procedural (point-to-point model, quick turnarounds, ticketless travel) to create an operating edge, rather than high-tech product innovation.
12. **Maintaining the Moat:** The company is currently facing challenges as competitors have attempted to copy parts of its model and its own legacy systems have struggled. To ensure a solid moat, it is actively investing in modernizing its operations to improve on-time performance and is exploring new revenue-generating initiatives like tiered seating options.

## Catalyst Analysis

Southwest Airlines' catalysts are primarily centered on a major business model transformation called the "Southwest. Even Better." plan, which focuses on generating new revenue and improving cost efficiency.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (2025 - 2026 Focus)**

1.  **High-Impact Revenue Initiatives from Strategic Overhaul:** The company is implementing changes like a new assigned seating system, 'Extra Legroom' seating, and charging for first and second checked bags, which are new sources of ancillary revenue. Management's aggressive 2026 profit forecast, which guided for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of at least \$4.00, signals that these new initiatives are expected to rapidly generate profit.

2.  **Cost Reduction and Efficiency Acceleration:** The management team is urgently working to accelerate and exceed a \$500 million cost initiative first announced at Investor Day. The goal is to aggressively mitigate cost inflation and exit 2025 with year-over-year growth in CASM-X (operating cost per seat mile, excluding fuel) in the low-single digits.

3.  **Increased Aircraft Utilization:** New operational strategies, including the introduction of redeye flights and efforts to reduce the time an aircraft spends on the ground between flights (turn times), are expected to maximize asset utilization. This allows for modest capacity growth with a smaller fleet.

4.  **Significant Shareholder Returns:** The company is executing on a \$2.5 billion share repurchase program, including an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program, demonstrating management's confidence and commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (2027 and Beyond)**

1.  **Achievement of Financial Targets from Transformation Plan:** The overarching "Southwest. Even Better." plan aims to deliver approximately \$4 billion in cumulative incremental run-rate earnings (EBIT) contribution by 2027. This financial improvement is targeted to drive a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 15% or greater.

2.  **Modernizing the Fleet and Cost Structure:** The eventual certification and delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX 7 aircraft, currently anticipated for 2026, will be a key long-term catalyst. The MAX 7 is expected to be an essential upgrade, offering 18% lower fuel costs per seat and replacing older, less fuel-efficient Boeing 737-700s.

3.  **Capacity Discipline for Stronger Returns:** Management remains committed to a strategy of long-term capacity discipline, planning to keep future growth at or below macroeconomic trends. This is intended to ensure growth is profitable and contributes toward the long-term goal of achieving returns on invested capital consistently in excess of the cost of capital.

4.  **Fleet Monetization Strategy:** The company plans to opportunistically monetize the value of its fleet and order book, which includes using sale-leaseback transactions and selling aircraft to help lower net capital spending over the next few years.

## Management Record

Based on a web search of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) management and strategy, here is an analysis for an investor:

### Current Management: CEO Robert (Bob) Jordan

1.  **CEO Tenure and Background:** Bob Jordan became the sixth CEO of Southwest Airlines on February 1, 2022. He is a 37-year Southwest veteran who has held 15 different leadership roles across Finance, Technology, Strategy, and as Chief Commercial Officer.
2.  **Key Past Decisions and Initiatives:** During his career at Southwest, Jordan was responsible for developing the e-commerce platform and the Rapid Rewards loyalty program, leading the "Heart" brand refresh, and playing a critical role in the integration of AirTran Airways (where he also served as President).
3.  **CEO Performance and Challenges:** Jordan's early tenure was marked by the severe December 2022 operational meltdown, which was attributed to antiquated IT systems, underscoring the need for the current major transformation. The company's financial performance under his initial leadership fell short of expectations, with activist investor Elliott Investment Management criticizing performance and calling for new leadership.
4.  **Employee and Analyst Sentiment:** His leadership team has generally received positive internal ratings (A-score from employees). Analyst sentiment is mixed, viewing the strategic evolution as both "pragmatic and risky" because it challenges the brand's decades-old simplicity.
5.  **Delivering Shareholder Value:** Historically, the previous management delivered an "unprecedented, uninterrupted profit streak of 47 years," but this was broken by the pandemic. Since Jordan took over, Southwest's stock and revenue per available seat mile (RASM) performance lagged behind major network rivals like Delta and United through late 2024. However, the stock saw a strong surge in 2025, outperforming peers, as investors began betting on the success of the new "transformation" plan.

### Future Strategy and Vision (The Transformation)

6.  **Vision Statement:** The corporate vision is "To be the world's most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline."
7.  **Future Strategy (The "Transformation"):** Jordan is spearheading the largest transformation in Southwest's history to modernize the airline, lower costs, and improve financial returns. Key initiatives include:
    *   **Revenue Generation:** Implementing assigned/premium seating, adding new fare bundles (like the rumored end to the "Bags Fly Free" policy), and adding new distribution channels like Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and Global Distribution Systems (GDS).
    *   **Network Expansion:** Adding redeye flying, increasing international routes (near-international focus), and formalizing global airline partnerships (e.g., Icelandair).
    *   **Technology & Operations:** Continuing heavy investment to upgrade technology and operations to prevent major service disruptions like the 2022 crisis.
8.  **Management Promises:** The new strategy is projected by management to generate significant financial upside, including over \$1 billion in pre-tax earnings next year and \$1.5 billion by 2027 from the new seating/product initiatives alone.

### Management Transition and Governance

9.  **Previous Management Change:** Bob Jordan succeeded Gary C. Kelly (who was CEO for nearly 18 years) in February 2022, with Kelly remaining as Executive Chairman.
10. **Activist Pressure and Board Changes:** A public campaign by activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management in 2024 led to significant corporate governance changes.
11. **Outcome of Activism:** Following Elliott's pressure, Executive Chairman Gary Kelly accelerated his retirement, and the Board announced plans to appoint new independent directors and refresh its membership to focus on financial oversight and strategy execution. The Board, however, reaffirmed its confidence in CEO Bob Jordan to execute the transformation plan.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Southwest Airlines Co.'s (LUV) governance documents, particularly the 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), the management and director incentives are structured primarily to align with long-term shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (Southwest Airlines Co. - LUV)**

1.  **High Weighting on Performance-Based Compensation:** The company's compensation philosophy is explicitly a "strong and transparent pay-for-performance philosophy" that is heavily weighted toward Long-Term Incentive (LTI) opportunities. This structure ensures that a significant portion of executive pay is "at risk" and directly dependent on company performance and stock price appreciation.
2.  **Focus on Capital Efficiency and Long-Term Value Creation:** Long-term incentive plans are tied to critical, multi-year shareholder-aligned metrics, most notably the strategic goal of achieving a **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of at least 15%** by 2027. ROIC is a measure of capital efficiency and sustained profitability, which is a key driver of long-term shareholder value.
3.  **Balance with Operational and Financial Metrics:** The Short-Term Incentive (STI) plan balances financial success with operational performance, including a metric for **Ontime Performance** that is benchmarked against top domestic peers. This mix encourages executives to achieve financial targets while maintaining the operational integrity and customer service necessary for sustainable growth.
4.  **Robust Insider Ownership Requirements:** The company maintains **robust share ownership guidelines** for executive officers and directors, compelling them to accumulate and hold significant amounts of company stock. While the exact aggregate percentage held by insiders is not detailed, the existence of these binding guidelines promotes a vested interest in the company's stock performance (higher the better).
5.  **Strong Anti-Abuse Governance Policies:** Several policies are in place to discourage executives from self-serving behaviors, including a **clawback policy** to recoup erroneously awarded incentive pay and a prohibition on **hedging or pledging** Company securities. These guardrails help ensure executives cannot profit while the company performs poorly.

### **Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

Management has **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The compensation structure is predominantly focused on at-risk, performance-based pay, with key long-term metrics like **ROIC and EBIT** tying compensation directly to the creation of economic value for shareholders.
*   The "robust share ownership guidelines" and prohibition on hedging enforce a long-term perspective and personal financial alignment with the company's stock price.
*   The overall structure demonstrates an intent to link executive wealth creation directly to the Company's successful execution of its strategic plan, which is designed to deliver superior shareholder returns.

---

## Long Thesis

Southwest's stock will rise because the company is executing a massive business overhaul that will boost profits dramatically. In the near term, they are introducing new ways to make money (like charging for assigned seats and offering premium seating options) which management projects will add billions in revenue. They are also fixing their outdated technology systems to prevent service meltdowns and improve on-time flight performance, making the airline more reliable and efficient. In the long term, this modernized, revenue-focused strategy, combined with their unique advantage of running the most efficient airline fleet in the US (using only 737s), will allow them to remain the low-cost leader while delivering superior financial returns to shareholders.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. The new strategies (assigned seating, premium fares) generate the billions in new revenue management expects without upsetting loyal customers who value Southwest's historic simplicity. 2. The large investments in modernizing the computer systems successfully prevent future catastrophic operational failures like the 2022 meltdown. 3. Fuel costs remain stable or manageable, and labor cost inflation does not fully erode the core cost advantage. 4. The economy and travel demand remain strong throughout the period.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This bear case identifies the major holes and faults in the long thesis for Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), primarily focusing on implementation risk, cost structure erosion, and external dependencies.

---

## Bear Case Critique of Southwest Airlines' Long Thesis

### I. Flaws in the New Revenue Strategy and Customer Assumption

1.  **Risk of Brand Erosion Outweighing Revenue Gains:** The thesis assumes new revenue strategies like assigned seating and premium fares will succeed without upsetting loyal customers. However, these changes fundamentally abandon Southwest's 50-year-old "no-frills" identity, which was a core differentiator for many customers, risking an unforeseen level of customer defection or a decline in brand preference as the airline becomes more like its competitors.
2.  **Increased Competitive Parity:** By adopting ancillary fees and fare bundles, Southwest is merely moving toward the pricing model already used by legacy carriers like Delta and United, making it harder to stand out in the leisure and budget travel markets. This may fail to generate a true *competitive advantage* and instead make its offering less compelling to both budget travelers (due to the new pricing complexity) and business travelers (who still prefer the network and premium options of legacy carriers).
3.  **High Execution Risk of Overhaul:** The move to assigned seating and premium cabins is a massive logistical overhaul that introduces operational complexity to an airline that has historically relied on the simplicity of its single-class, open-seating system. Flawless execution is required to realize the massive projected revenue gains, and any stumble in the rollout could lead to customer confusion and operational delays.

### II. Erosion of the Core Low-Cost Advantage (CASM)

1.  **Labor Cost Advantage is Lost:** The assumption that labor cost inflation will not fully erode the cost advantage is directly challenged by recent data. Southwest's labor cost, as a percentage of expenses and per seat-mile, is now among the highest in the US airline industry, dramatically outpacing both legacy carriers and true ultra-low-cost competitors.
2.  **Inflationary Cost Pressure Outpacing Revenue:** Recent labor contracts, including a substantial pay increase for pilots, have caused non-fuel unit costs (CASM-ex fuel) to climb faster than anticipated and potentially faster than unit revenue (RASM) in the near term, squeezing profit margins even with strong demand. This suggests that Southwest has lost its "low-cost leader" status, shifting its competitive position.

### III. Operational and Fleet Efficiency Constraints

1.  **Major Constraint from Boeing Delivery Delays:** The "unique advantage of running the most efficient airline fleet" is severely undermined by ongoing Boeing 737 MAX delivery delays. Southwest expects to receive over 100 fewer aircraft than contracted in 2026, forcing it to keep older, less fuel-efficient 737 NGs in service longer than planned.
2.  **Hindered Fleet Modernization and Capacity:** The lack of new aircraft deliveries limits capacity growth and slows the retirement of older planes, which not only drives up maintenance and fuel costs but also restricts the airline's ability to fully implement the new cabin retrofits (extra legroom/premium seats) critical to the revenue-boosting thesis.
3.  **Risk of Future Operational Failures:** While investments in technology are underway, the magnitude of the 2022 operational meltdown exposed deep structural issues in the IT and scheduling systems. The multi-year plan is a race to fix systemic flaws while simultaneously implementing the massive complexity of a commercial overhaul. This high-risk concurrent implementation increases the probability of non-weather-related operational failures.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis you've provided, the next steps should focus on quantifying the risks identified in the bear case and validating the assumptions underlying the long thesis. Your current analysis is *very strong* on the narrative, but needs hard data on execution and peer comparison.

Here are the most important questions and steps to investigate next:

### **I. Quantify the Cost Erosion and Moat Risk**

1.  **Peer-to-Peer Cost Comparison (CASM-ex):**
    *   **Question:** How does Southwest's current non-fuel unit cost (CASM-ex) for Q4 2025 and projected 2026 growth actually compare, *in dollar terms*, to that of Ultra Low-Cost Carriers (ULCCs) like Spirit or Frontier, and to its main network rivals (Delta, United)?
    *   *Need:* The bear case claims LUV has lost its "low-cost leader" status, but this must be benchmarked against competitors to fully assess the threat to its historical cost moat.

2.  **Specific Financial Impact of Boeing Delays:**
    *   **Question:** What are the **precise financial consequences** of the Boeing 737 MAX delivery delays? Southwest now expects only 66 MAX 8 deliveries in 2026, over 100 fewer than contracted, and *no* MAX 7 deliveries in 2026.
    *   *Need:* This forces the airline to fly older, less fuel-efficient 737-700s longer, which directly increases maintenance and fuel costs, eating into the savings promised by the transformation. Quantify this impact on the overall cost (CASM).

### **II. Assess Execution Risk and Customer Response**

3.  **Early Customer Retention and Brand Perception:**
    *   **Question:** The implementation of major changes like assigned seating, extra-legroom seats, and new fare bundles just began in late January 2026. What is the early, hard data on *customer retention* and *upsell rates*?
    *   *Need:* The search results show a split reaction: Management claims the changes were executed flawlessly with better operational performance, but some passengers and bloggers report initial chaos, longer boarding times due to people bringing more carry-ons, and a feeling that LUV is now "just like but less than" legacy carriers.

4.  **Operational Performance and IT System Stability:**
    *   **Question:** The long thesis assumes successful prevention of future meltdowns. How complete are the upgrades to the crew-scheduling and operations IT systems that failed in 2022?
    *   *Need:* Current data shows Southwest was ranked the number one US airline for on-time performance in Q4 2025 by The Wall Street Journal. This is a strong positive for the long thesis, but confirmation of the IT system modernization milestones is still needed.

### **III. Valuation and Financial Benchmarking**

5.  **Comparative Valuation Metrics:**
    *   **Question:** Given the aggressive 2026 adjusted EPS guidance of **at least \$4.00**, what is the resulting Forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio? How does this P/E compare to the average P/E of its closest rivals (Delta, United, JetBlue) based on *their* 2026 consensus estimates?
    *   *Need:* This will help determine if the massive recent stock price jump has fully priced in the expected 2026 transformation success, or if the stock is still cheap relative to peers based on the new guidance.
