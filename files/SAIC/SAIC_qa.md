## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) operates almost entirely as a specialized technology and consulting firm for one main customer: the U.S. Government. Its clients include major components of the Department of Defense (DoD), intelligence agencies, and federal civilian offices. SAIC's core business model is centered on winning large, competitive, multi-year contracts to help the government with complex tasks, such as modernizing outdated computer systems, integrating new military hardware, and providing advanced cybersecurity services. Revenue is generated from fees paid by the government based on the time, effort, and specialized resources dedicated to these specific project tasks.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant risk for SAIC is its overwhelming reliance on the stability and budget priorities of the U.S. Government. In the near term, if Congress fails to pass funding bills (leading to government shutdowns) or if there are unexpected budget cuts, SAIC's ability to win new contracts or continue existing work is immediately jeopardized. This kind of budget uncertainty has hurt contractors in the past, notably during periods of automatic spending cuts. A separate near-term risk is the constant need to re-compete for major contracts; if SAIC loses a large, existing contract to a competitor during the renewal process, it instantly harms current earnings. A key long-term risk is related to security and compliance. Since SAIC handles highly classified national security information, a major cybersecurity failure or a breach of strict government protocols could result in severe penalties, heavy fines, or even 'debarment,' which means the company would be banned from bidding on new federal work. While compliance risk is standard in the defense sector, the growing sophistication of cyber threats makes managing this risk more costly and critical than ever before.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a major technology integrator for the U.S. government.

***

### 1. Inception and Purpose: 1969 to 2000s

1.  **Founding Vision:** Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster, a physicist from Los Alamos, with an initial focus on high-level scientific and engineering projects for the U.S. government.
2.  **The "Why" it was Founded:** Dr. Beyster wanted to create a company that applied advanced science and technology to solve the nation’s most complex challenges, such as studying the effects of nuclear power and weapons.
3.  **Unique Culture:** SAIC embraced an unusual business model for its time: **employee-ownership**, where stock was widely distributed among the staff. This was meant to foster an entrepreneurial spirit and encourage the best and brightest scientists and engineers to stay with the company.
4.  **Early Growth (Tailwind):** The company steadily grew throughout the 1970s and 1980s by diversifying its services beyond defense into areas like national security, energy, and environmental programs, taking advantage of the growing need for high-tech problem solving in the government sector.

***

### 2. Major Challenges and the Transformative Split: 2006 to 2013

1.  **Transition to Public Ownership (Headwind & Solution):** In 2006, SAIC held its Initial Public Offering (IPO), transitioning from a private, employee-owned firm to a publicly traded corporation. This gave the long-term employee-owners the ability to finally cash out their stock.
2.  **The Organizational Conflict Problem (Headwind):** As SAIC grew larger and offered both *advice* (consulting) and *solutions* (building systems) to the government, it ran into a serious challenge called **Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)**.
3.  **Explaining the Conflict of Interest:** Government rules prevent a single company from both helping an agency **plan and design** a major system and then later **bidding to build** that same system. This is because having the inside planning knowledge gives them an unfair advantage over competitors, and their advice could be biased to favor their own future business.
4.  **The Strategic Solution (The Split):** To remove this restriction and allow both parts of the business to compete for a wider range of lucrative government contracts, the company underwent a monumental split in 2013, separating into two independent, publicly traded companies.
5.  **The Outcome of the Split:** The "original" company changed its name to **Leidos**, focusing on technology development and high-end engineering. The new spin-off company, which focused on government services and information technology, retained the name **SAIC** (which is the current company).

***

### 3. Modern Era and Present Date: 2013 to Present

1.  **Current Focus (Goal):** Today, SAIC is a Fortune 500 company operating as a premier "mission integrator" for the U.S. government. Its goal is to act as the technological backbone, taking various emerging commercial technologies (like cloud and AI) and securely blending them into complex government and national security systems.
2.  **Continuous Growth by Acquisition (Tailwind):** The company continued to expand its capabilities and market presence by acquiring other specialized firms, notably Engility Holdings (2018) and the Unisys US Federal business (2020), which strengthened its position in digital services, cloud, and security.
3.  **A New Business Strategy (Innovative Solution):** SAIC shifted its focus to high-growth, higher-margin areas it calls "Growth and Technological Accelerants" (GTA), which include cloud computing, large-scale enterprise IT solutions, and systems integration.
4.  **Digital Innovation (Innovative Solution):** To stay competitive, SAIC established internal "Digital Factories" which serve as innovation labs. These labs rapidly develop new, modern solutions in areas like cloud and advanced engineering, helping the company differentiate itself and win new contracts.
5.  **Dealing with Headwinds:** A persistent challenge is the heavy reliance on federal funding (nearly all revenue comes from government contracts), making the company susceptible to fluctuations, budget uncertainties, and occasional slowdowns in federal civilian spending.
6.  **Present Status:** With annual revenues around $7.5 billion and a workforce of approximately 25,000 employees, SAIC is a leading technology partner primarily serving the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, and other major civilian government agencies.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is built less on proprietary technology and more on a combination of high-friction regulatory and operational barriers, deep institutional trust, and extremely high customer switching costs within the U.S. government market.

Here is an analysis of SAIC's competitive advantages:

### **Moat and Differentiation (Why it's hard to displace)**

1.  **Security Clearance and Cleared Personnel Barrier:** The need for a large workforce with high-level, difficult-to-obtain government security clearances is one of the company's strongest moats. This talent pool cannot be hired overnight or bought easily by a competitor with more capital.
2.  **Unmatched "Past Performance" and Institutional Trust:** In government contracting, a company's history of successfully executing complex, "no-fail" missions (especially for the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community) is a critical factor in winning future bids. This established trust and track record cannot be replicated by a new entrant.
3.  **Prime Contractor Status on Key Contract Vehicles:** SAIC holds prime positions on large, multi-agency contracts (like GSA Alliant 2 and OASIS+). This status acts as a powerful barrier, giving them access to bid on vast pools of government spending that smaller or newer competitors cannot reach.
4.  **High Customer Switching Costs:** SAIC's services involve deep integration of its solutions into the customer's mission-critical IT infrastructure and daily operations (e.g., modernizing a combatant command's network). The complexity and risk of switching these services to a new provider create extremely sticky customer relationships.

### **Contracts, Recurring Revenue, and Ease of Displacement**

1.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The vast majority of SAIC's revenue comes from long-term, multi-year contracts (average duration is over five years), evidenced by a large estimated contract backlog (approx. \$22.9 billion). This structure ensures a highly recurring revenue stream.
2.  **Difficulty of Displacement by Capital Alone:** A competitor with more money could try to underbid SAIC, but they would struggle to overcome the two main hurdles: the slow, multi-year process of getting employees the necessary security clearances, and the time-consuming process of establishing "Past Performance" history.
3.  **Indirect "Network Effect" (Reputation Moat):** Although not a classic software network effect, every successful contract SAIC executes improves its "Past Performance" rating. This makes the company more competitive on the next bid, creating a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle that favors incumbents like SAIC.

### **Pricing Power and Product Differentiation**

1.  **Special Position: Mission Integrator:** SAIC’s fundamental differentiation is not necessarily a single product, but its role as a "premier mission integrator" that securely and rapidly integrates the best emerging commercial technologies (AI, Cloud, Digital Engineering) into the government's complex, legacy, and highly secure operating environments.
2.  **Pricing Power is Differentiated:** Pricing power is mixed, as is common in this industry. In "Cost-Plus" contracts, cost savings are often returned to the government, limiting margins. However, SAIC is strategically shifting its focus to higher-margin, fixed-price contracts in key areas like cloud and AI ("Growth and Technological Accelerants"), where its differentiated expertise allows for better profitability and greater pricing control.

### **Reason for Growth and Innovation Strategy**

1.  **Reason for Growth (Strategic Acquisitions):** SAIC grew into what it is today by successfully bridging commercial technology and government mission requirements, and significantly, by executing strategic, large-scale acquisitions (such as Engility Holdings and the Unisys US Federal business) to rapidly gain scale and core competencies in key growth markets like engineering and IT modernization.
2.  **R&D Focus (Application and Integration):** SAIC is a service and systems integration company, not a product developer in the traditional sense, so it does not spend as much on R&D as a pure technology firm. Instead, its "innovation factory" focuses on internal investment to develop capabilities and expertise to quickly *apply* and *integrate* cutting-edge commercial solutions into government systems, rather than inventing them from scratch.
3.  **Necessity to Innovate:** To maintain its edge, SAIC must constantly innovate in its service offerings (e.g., adopting the latest in Zero Trust security or Generative AI) to keep its value proposition relevant and win new government mandates for digital modernization.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that could increase Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) stock price in the near and long term are outlined below, based on recent company activities, contract wins, and management commentary from recent earnings calls (Q4 FY2025, Q1, Q2, and Q3 FY2026).

### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Large Contract Wins and Backlog Strength:** Recent significant contract awards, such as the \$1.4 billion COBRA task order and the \$242 million U.S. Navy contract, provide clear revenue visibility and demonstrate successful execution of the business development strategy. The company's healthy book-to-bill ratio, which measures new contract wins against revenue, suggests a strong foundation for future revenue growth despite recent revenue challenges.

2.  **Profitability and Margin Expansion:** Management is actively focused on cost efficiency and improving profitability across its contract portfolio, which led to profit margins rebounding well in a recent quarter. Continued execution of these cost control measures is expected to mitigate revenue softness and drive greater earnings per share (EPS).

3.  **Capital Deployment and Share Repurchases:** SAIC is committed to returning capital to shareholders, with plans to repurchase approximately \$500 million in shares over fiscal years 2026 and 2027 and a new \$1.2 billion share repurchase authorization. These actions reduce the share count and can boost EPS, which is generally a positive stock price catalyst.

### Long-Term Catalysts

4.  **Growth in Mission-Critical Technology:** Management is strategically focused on markets that value advanced technology, specifically mentioning digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and digital engineering for defense, space, and civilian customers. The acquisition of companies like SilverEdge is aimed at enhancing SAIC's AI capabilities, positioning the company for long-term growth in high-value, outcome-based work.

5.  **Targeted Enterprise Growth Strategy:** The CEO has stated that they are executing against an "enterprise growth strategy" and expect the return on their investments to accelerate, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027. This multi-year plan is intended to be a significant driver of long-term value creation.

6.  **Robust Opportunity Pipeline:** The company is increasing its targets for new bid submissions, with management citing a strong pipeline that is on track to reach over \$30 billion in submissions by fiscal year 2027. Furthermore, the expected margins implied in the new submissions are noted to be higher than the current company-wide margins, promising more profitable future revenue.

7.  **Government Spending Stability:** As a technology integrator with a diversified customer portfolio across the Department of Defense, Civilian Agencies, and the Intelligence Community, SAIC is well-positioned to benefit from long-term, stable federal government spending on modernization and national security. Management acknowledges that while delays in new contract awards from customers have been a short-term challenge, their diversification helps mitigate a challenging budget outlook in any single branch, like the Army.

## Management Record

This analysis of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) management is based on information relevant to an investor, focusing on the recent period of management transitions and strategic shifts.

### **I. Management History and Transitions**

1.  **CEO Nazzic S. Keene (Pre-2023) to Toni Townes-Whitley (2023-2025):** The transition from Nazzic S. Keene (CEO from August 2019) to Toni Townes-Whitley was announced as a planned retirement and a result of a "thorough and thoughtful CEO succession planning process."
2.  **Keene's Track Record:** During her four-year tenure, Keene's leadership was credited by the board with generating increased value for shareholders, improving customer outcomes, and accelerating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.
3.  **Toni Townes-Whitley's Background:** Townes-Whitley, who was one of only two Black women leading a Fortune 500 company at the time, joined SAIC in October 2023 with a 35-year technology career, including a high-level role at Microsoft leading the U.S. regulated industries and being President of CGI Federal.
4.  **CEO Toni Townes-Whitley's Abrupt Departure (Late 2025):** Townes-Whitley "stepped down," or "parted ways" abruptly after just over a year as CEO; SAIC did not give a specific reason, but the departure followed a revenue miss and lowered revenue guidance for the fiscal year 2026. The SEC filing noted she separated "without cause" and will receive severance, indicating a board-driven decision without clear public explanation.
5.  **Interim CEO Appointment:** Following the abrupt departure, James Reagan, a former Leidos executive and current SAIC board member, was appointed as the interim CEO, causing a negative market reaction due to the leadership uncertainty.

### **II. Performance and Delivery on Shareholder Value**

6.  **Delivering Value in the Recent Past:** SAIC delivered a significant 30% Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in Fiscal Year 2023, contrasting strongly with the S&P 500's decline of 5% in the same period, demonstrating effective financial management and capital deployment (e.g., share repurchases and dividends).
7.  **Financial Execution:** In a recent strong financial period (FY24 Q4), management cited "very strong" underlying execution, which led to increased adjusted EBITDA margins and an 11% growth in free cash flow per share, indicating a focus on profitability and capital efficiency.
8.  **Recent Performance and Promises:** The company faced challenges in late 2025 with a quarterly revenue miss and an organic revenue contraction, leading management to lower its full-year guidance for fiscal year 2026, suggesting difficulty in meeting initial revenue projections.
9.  **Analyst Skepticism:** Some analysis of former CEO Townes-Whitley's track record raised investor caution about her execution history, particularly concerning the necessary operational discipline for converting a strong contract backlog into recognized revenue growth.

### **III. Future Strategy and Key Decisions**

10. **Multi-Year Growth Strategy:** SAIC announced a multi-year strategy in 2024 to accelerate profitable organic growth through "strategic pivots" focusing on four key areas: portfolio, go-to-market approach, culture, and brand.
11. **Key Organizational Decision (2024):** Management executed a major reorganization in February 2024 into five new customer-aligned business groups (Army, Navy, Air Force/Combatant Commands, Space/Intelligence, and Civilian) to improve customer intimacy and drive cross-collaboration.
12. **Second Organizational Decision (2025):** The interim CEO, James Reagan, announced a further strategic organizational restructuring in late 2025 to consolidate the five groups into three (Army Navy Group, Air Force Space & Intelligence, and Civilian), aiming to simplify the structure for increased efficiency and sustainable long-term shareholder value.
13. **Technology & Portfolio Focus:** The strategy emphasizes transforming the portfolio toward higher-margin, differentiated capabilities like Digital, AI, and mission solutions, supported by acquisitions like SilverEdge Government Solutions to bring in new AI expertise.
14. **Long-Term Vision:** The company's vision is to establish itself as a technology integrator focused on advancing the power of technology to serve and protect, with a long-term target of achieving approximately 10% EBITDA margins.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) latest proxy statement (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure demonstrates a strong alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Heavy Weighting Towards At-Risk Pay:** A significant majority of executive compensation is comprised of variable, at-risk incentives, primarily through short-term incentive (STI) cash bonuses and long-term incentive (LTI) equity awards.
2.  **Strict Performance Metrics for Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** LTI awards (Performance Stock Units or PSUs) are directly linked to the company's long-term health and relative stock performance over a three-year period.
3.  **Key LTI Performance Measures:** The required metrics for long-term equity payouts include **three-year cumulative operating cash flows**, **three-year cumulative earnings**, and a **Total Shareholder Return (TSR) metric** that compares SAIC's stock performance against a peer group.
4.  **Short-Term Incentive Metrics:** Annual cash bonuses (STI) are generally tied to an internal measure of profitability, with **Adjusted EBITDA** noted as a prominent performance metric.

### **Insider Ownership and Holding Requirements**

1.  **Mandatory Stock Ownership Guidelines:** SAIC has formal and stringent stock ownership guidelines, requiring the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to hold stock valued at **5 times** their annual base salary and other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) to hold stock valued at **3 times** their annual base salary.
2.  **High Stock Holding Requirements:** Executive officers are subject to a **Stock Holding Requirements Policy** which mandates they must retain (hold onto) **100% of the net shares** acquired from equity awards until their respective stock ownership multiple is achieved.
3.  **Prohibition on Hedging:** The company maintains a policy that explicitly prohibits all executive officers and directors from engaging in speculative transactions like short selling, and from hedging or pledging company stock, preventing them from insulating themselves from a drop in the stock price.
4.  **Insider Ownership Percentage:** While the collective beneficial ownership percentage for all directors and executive officers is typically low for large, widely held public companies, the existence of the high ownership *multiples* (3x-5x) and the 100% holding requirement are stronger indicators of commitment than the simple percentage itself.

### **Conclusion**

*   **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment:** Management has a **strong incentive to act in the interest of shareholders**.
*   **Rationale:** The compensation structure is fundamentally pay-for-performance, heavily weighted toward long-term equity. The inclusion of **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** means executives are only rewarded for stock performance that is better than their competitors, and the use of **cumulative cash flow and earnings** metrics ensures the focus is on sustained financial health, not just short-term gains. The mandated stock ownership multiples (5x/3x) and 100% holding requirement ensure that a substantial portion of the executives' personal wealth is directly tied to the company's long-term stock value, going beyond merely lining their own pockets.

## Long Thesis

SAIC is the essential, trusted technology partner for the entire U.S. government, especially the military and intelligence community. In the near term, the stock should be supported by two factors: a massive backlog of already-won contracts providing predictable revenue, and management's focus on cost control and using massive share buybacks to increase profit per share. Long term, the bull case rests on the inescapable need for the government to modernize its ancient IT and security systems. Because SAIC holds the highest security clearances, has a stellar track record (institutional trust), and specializes in securely integrating the latest commercial technologies (like AI and Cloud) into complex government missions, it is uniquely positioned to capture a growing share of this highly sticky, highly profitable, multi-year digital modernization wave. The complexity and mission-critical nature of the work means customers face extremely high costs if they try to switch providers, guaranteeing stable, recurring revenue for SAIC for the foreseeable future.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions for this bull case are: 1) The US Congress continues to authorize stable and robust long-term funding for defense, national security, and essential IT modernization projects. 2) SAIC’s restructured leadership can quickly stabilize the organization and successfully execute its strategy to hit announced targets for higher profit margins (EBITDA). 3) The company successfully converts its contract backlog into recognized revenue without facing significant delays due to government funding uncertainties or new competition. 4) SAIC maintains its superior status and past performance rating required to win the highest-value, mission-critical contracts in areas like AI and Digital Engineering.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for SAIC has several structural and near-term execution-related flaws that expose it to significant risk.

### **Critique and Faults in the Long Thesis**

#### **I. Flaws in the Near-Term Financial Support & Execution (Backlog, Buybacks, and Margins)**

1.  **Backlog Conversion Risk:** While the backlog is massive, recent quarterly results have included a revenue miss, which management partially attributed to a "slower conversion of on-contract growth opportunities into revenues" and delays. This directly undermines the thesis's reliance on a **"predictable revenue"** stream.
2.  **Weak Backlog Replenishment:** The trailing twelve months book-to-bill ratio of below 1.0 (e.g., 0.9 as of Q3 FY2025) suggests the company is currently consuming its backlog faster than it is winning new contracts. This trend, if sustained, will lead to a shrinking backlog over time, diminishing the long-term revenue visibility.
3.  **Questionable Margin Execution:** Despite a focus on cost control, SAIC **lowered its full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance** in the most recent reporting period, which makes the assumption that leadership can "successfully execute its strategy to hit announced targets for higher profit margins (EBITDA)" tenuous.
4.  **Organizational Instability:** The assumption of restructured leadership "quickly stabiliz[ing] the organization" is challenged by a recent major restructuring that consolidated business groups and involved the **departure of key executives** (including the EVP of Army, EVP of Space & Intelligence, and Chief Innovation Officer), signaling significant internal upheaval.
5.  **Unaddressed Legal and Debt Headwinds:** The thesis ignores material downside risks such as the company managing a **"material debt load"** and facing "Key government audits and a DOJ criminal subpoena," which could impact financial flexibility and reputation.

#### **II. Flaws in the Long-Term Competitive & "Sticky" Moat (Uniqueness and High Switching Costs)**

1.  **Direct and Intense Competition:** The claim of being **"uniquely positioned"** is an overstatement in an extremely competitive market. Large, capable peers like Leidos and Booz Allen Hamilton are aggressively competing for the same high-value cloud and AI integration contracts and have even formally protested SAIC's wins.
2.  **Government Policy Undermines "Stickiness":** The U.S. government is actively pushing for a shift toward **"technology-agnostic open integration"** to "promote innovation and competition among vendors" and specifically **"avoid vendor lock-in."** This directly counters the bull case's core argument that customers face **"extremely high costs if they try to switch providers."**
3.  **Regulatory Risk to Consulting Services:** The long-term assumption of *multi-year* highly profitable contracts faces risk from an ongoing Department of Defense **"massive review of consulting services contracts"** with the stated goal of cutting or terminating activities deemed "not essential."

#### **III. Flaw in Funding Stability Assumption**

1.  **Systemic Budget Delays (Continuing Resolutions):** The assumption of **"stable and robust long-term funding"** is structurally flawed. The Department of Defense routinely operates under short-term **Continuing Resolutions (CRs)**, which is a common occurrence that **"prohibit[s] funding for new initiatives"** and stalls the launch of the very modernization projects the bull case depends on.
2.  **Sequestration Risk:** A protracted budget dispute could trigger the automatic sequestration mechanism under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would result in **automatic, across-the-board budget cuts** to defense and other federal spending, crippling new IT modernization initiatives.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)**

SAIC is a defense services firm operating in a mature, hyper-competitive, and politically-constrained market. The stock faces significant near-term execution risk due to a **major management restructuring, the departure of key leaders, and a lowered profit guidance**, suggesting internal instability at a critical moment for its margin expansion strategy. The company's reliance on share buybacks to boost EPS is unsustainable as a primary value driver, especially with a **material debt load** and a **shrinking backlog** (indicated by a book-to-bill ratio below 1.0).

Long-term, the bull case's core premise of a protected, "sticky" digital modernization wave is actively being dismantled by the customer itself. The U.S. government's push for **technology-agnostic, multi-cloud, and open-integration contracting** is deliberately designed to increase competition from rivals (like Leidos and Booz Allen Hamilton) and eliminate the very "high switching costs" that SAIC touts as its moat. Combined with the perpetual political risk of **Continuing Resolutions (CRs)**, which stall new program starts and delay capital deployment into modernization, SAIC is poised for **flat-to-low organic revenue growth** with constant pressure on margins and a fading competitive advantage.

## Next Steps

Based on your extensive analysis, you have a solid qualitative understanding of SAIC's business, risks, and strategic position. The most glaring omissions are **quantitative financial data, valuation multiples,** and **immediate answers on severe legal risks.**

Here are the important questions still left unanswered and the most critical next steps for your investigation:

### **Critical Financial & Valuation Analysis**

1.  **Quantitative Valuation and Peer Comparison:** You have no current valuation data. You must find SAIC's current P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA multiple, and Free Cash Flow (FCF) yield and compare these key metrics directly against its primary competitors (Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton) to determine if the stock is cheap or expensive relative to the sector.
2.  **Debt and Balance Sheet Health:** You noted a "material debt load" but have not quantified it. Investigate SAIC's current long-term debt, net debt, and cash position, and look for its Debt-to-EBITDA ratio to assess its financial risk and flexibility for future acquisitions or buybacks.
3.  **Profitability and Margin Goals:** You have a vague idea of margin pressure. What are SAIC's **actual** reported Gross, Operating, and Net Profit Margins? How do these compare to the company's stated long-term target of approximately 10% EBITDA margin, and what is the current timeline for reaching that goal?

### **Unaddressed Legal and Executive Risks**

4.  **DOJ Criminal Subpoena and Audits:** The Bear Case cites a "Key government audits and a DOJ criminal subpoena" as a material downside risk. This is a severe, high-priority, uncited risk that requires immediate investigation to understand the nature of the inquiry, its scope, and the potential financial penalties or reputational damage.
5.  **New Permanent CEO Status:** You noted the abrupt departure of the former CEO and the appointment of an interim CEO. The market dislikes uncertainty; what is the current status of the search for a permanent CEO, and has the board provided a specific timeline for filling the role?

### **Contract and Backlog Quality**

6.  **Contract Mix and Margin Profile:** To support the margin expansion thesis, you need to quantify the contract mix. What percentage of SAIC's revenue is currently generated from higher-margin, Fixed-Price (FP) contracts versus lower-margin, Cost-Plus (CP) contracts, and what specific mix is management targeting for the next 1-3 years?
7.  **Backlog Conversion and Book-to-Bill:** Confirm the *most recent* book-to-bill ratio (must be below 1.0 to validate the shrinking backlog risk). Investigate what percentage of the large backlog is actually funded and ready to be converted into revenue, versus what is unfunded and subject to greater Congressional budget risk.
