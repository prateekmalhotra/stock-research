## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) operates almost entirely as a service provider for the U.S. Federal Government, primarily serving the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and various civilian agencies. The business model is focused on securing large, multi-year contracts where they provide technology modernization, digital transformation, cybersecurity defense, and engineering support. This model is known as Business-to-Government (B2G), meaning the company relies heavily on domestic taxpayer funding and government needs rather than commercial sales or international markets. Revenue is earned by successfully executing these complex service contracts and continuously winning competitive bids against other large government contractors.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the company's reliance on government spending, making earnings vulnerable to political volatility, such as budget stalemates or government shutdowns, which have historically occurred and can cause immediate disruption and delays in payments. Intense competition also poses a risk, as constant low-bidding for contracts can compress profit margins. In the long term, if the government's spending priorities change dramatically—for example, if they decide to invest less in modernizing current systems and more in entirely new technologies like advanced artificial intelligence or space defense—SAIC must quickly adapt or risk its core services becoming obsolete. Furthermore, strict regulatory requirements mean that any failure in compliance, security breaches, or ethical missteps can lead to massive penalties, contract terminations, or being barred from future bids.

## Company History

This is a detailed, simple history of the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a major technology integrator and services provider for the U.S. government.

***

### **The Inception and Founding Purpose (1969 - 2013)**

1.  **Founding by a Scientist:** Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert "Bob" Beyster, a physicist from the University of California. He started the small research and engineering firm in San Diego, California, with the goal of applying scientific and technical expertise to solve the nation's most complex problems.

2.  **The First Goal: High-Tech Problem Solving:** The company's initial contracts were with the U.S. military, focusing on specialized scientific projects, such as studying the effects of underwater explosions for the Navy and working on nuclear power and weapons effects programs.

3.  **An Innovative Solution: Employee Ownership (Tailwind):** A major early success and a key part of its culture was an employee-ownership model. This structure was innovative for a company of its kind, fostering an entrepreneurial spirit by encouraging staff to be personally invested in the company's success and growth.

4.  **Early Growth and Diversification (Tailwind):** Throughout the 1970s and 80s, SAIC steadily grew by securing contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy, and intelligence agencies. It broadened its services beyond national security into areas like environmental services and healthcare technology, which helped reduce its dependence on any single government sector.

5.  **Dealing with Early Headwinds:** Despite its growth, the company faced ethical and legal challenges. For instance, in 1990, it pleaded guilty to 10 felony counts of fraud related to a Superfund environmental cleanup site.

***

### **The Major Structural Challenge and Solution (2013 Split)**

6.  **The Core Problem (Headwind): Conflict of Interest:** By the 2010s, the company was so large and involved in so many different projects for the government that it began running into a significant roadblock: **organizational conflicts of interest (OCI).** Government regulations prevented a single company from both designing a system (developing the capability) and then advising the government on which system to buy (technical support).

7.  **The Innovative Solution: A Corporate Split:** In a major strategic move in 2013, the company split into two separate, independent, public companies to resolve this conflict.
    *   The original parent company, which focused on large-scale technology development and R&D projects, was renamed **Leidos**.
    *   A new company was spun off, which retained the **SAIC** name and focused on providing high-end technical services, advisory support, and information technology (IT) support to the government.

8.  **SAIC's New, Sharper Goal:** The newly separated SAIC was now purely focused on being a premier **technology integrator and government services provider**. Its core mission became translating complex national security and civilian needs into secure, high-end digital solutions.

***

### **Present Day and Current Trajectory (2013 - Present)**

9.  **Strategic Acquisitions (Tailwind):** Since the split, SAIC has strengthened its position by acquiring competitors, which instantly boosted its capabilities and customer base. Key acquisitions include Scitor Holdings (2015) to expand its presence in the intelligence sector, Engility (2019) to add more engineering and logistics services, and Unisys US Federal (2020) for government IT services.

10. **The Current Business Focus:** Today, SAIC operates primarily as a high-tech partner to the U.S. government, with nearly all its revenue coming from federal agencies, mainly in the defense, intelligence, and civilian markets. This work involves major areas like:
    *   **Mission IT and Digital Transformation:** Modernizing outdated government computer systems and networks.
    *   **Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing:** Protecting critical data and helping agencies move their operations to modern cloud platforms.
    *   **Advanced Solutions:** Developing and integrating new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) for applications like instant information retrieval to help military personnel make faster decisions.

11. **The Modern Headwind: Customer Concentration:** A significant challenge today is that SAIC remains overwhelmingly dependent on the U.S. government as its sole customer. This means its financial stability can be impacted by political changes, delays in the annual Congressional budget process, or government shutdowns.

12. **The Enduring Goal:** SAIC's current objective is to secure large, multi-year contracts by integrating the best emerging commercial technologies into the government's highly complex and secure systems. They aim to be the critical technology backbone that modernizes and enables essential national security and public service missions.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is built primarily on **switching costs** and **government-mandated barriers to entry**, rather than traditional intellectual property or pricing power. Its success stems from a decades-long specialization in the complex U.S. federal government procurement system.

---

### **Analysis of SAIC's Moat**

#### **1. Competitive Advantage and Differentiation (The Moat)**

*   **Deep Government Access (Intangible Asset):** SAIC's core strength is its **embedded position** and long-standing trust with U.S. government agencies, particularly the Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community, and NASA.
*   **Mission Integrator Specialization:** The company is known as a premier "mission integrator," meaning it combines emerging commercial technology (like cloud and AI) with its deep knowledge of complex government missions and legacy systems.
*   **Past Performance as a Barrier:** Government agencies heavily prioritize contractors with a proven track record (known as "past performance") on large, complex federal programs. This creates a powerful, non-capital barrier that makes it very hard for a new, unproven company to compete on the biggest contracts.

#### **2. Pricing Power and Market Position**

*   **Limited Pricing Power:** SAIC operates in a competitive market of government services, which often leads to pressure on profit margins.
*   **Contract Mix for Margin:** The company gains better profitability by performing work that requires a higher proportion of its own skilled employees (labor) and by winning "Fixed Price" contracts rather than the lower-margin "Cost-Reimbursement" contracts.
*   **Special Position:** Its special position is being one of the few large, certified, and trusted companies capable of handling **mission-critical, high-security** IT and engineering services at a national scale for defense and intelligence clients.

#### **3. Customer and Contract Stickiness**

*   **Sticky and Recurring Contracts (Switching Costs):** SAIC's customers and contracts are highly **sticky**. The company consistently reports a massive backlog (e.g., approximately $29.1 billion), which provides strong revenue visibility.
*   **High Switching Costs:** Its contracts are typically large, multi-year awards (often four to eight years) for integrating and maintaining complex, mission-critical systems. Switching providers would involve massive costs, time delays, and security risks for the government, effectively locking in the incumbent.
*   **Not One-Time:** The work is rarely a one-time transaction; it usually involves the continuous modernization, sustainment, and operation of vital national systems like Army IT platforms or Navy torpedo systems.

#### **4. Ease of Displacement and Network Effects**

*   **Hard to Displace by Capital Alone:** A competitor with more capital would struggle to displace SAIC because the most significant barriers are non-monetary, namely the multi-year process of establishing a credible **past performance record**, achieving the necessary high-level **security clearances**, and navigating the complex **Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)** compliance systems.
*   **Structural Network Advantage:** The advantage functions *like* a network effect. By winning a prime position on major multi-award contracting vehicles (like ASTRO or NETCENTS-2), SAIC gains access to a broad platform for winning smaller, specific task orders across multiple government agencies (Army, Air Force, Navy, DHS). Success on one system opens the door to related systems, further embedding the company across the U.S. government.

#### **5. Innovation and R&D Investment**

*   **Innovation Strategy:** SAIC maintains its edge by strategically integrating emerging commercial technologies—such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud computing—into the government's highly secure and specific environment.
*   **R&D Focus (Not Pure Spending):** As a government services and integration firm, SAIC does not have the massive internal R&D expenses of a pure technology or product company. Their focus is on the **application** and **integration** of cutting-edge tech through strategic acquisitions (e.g., acquiring companies for new AI capabilities) and internal innovation programs (like its competitive Research Fellows Program), rather than inventing the core technology itself.
*   **Constant Innovation is Required:** Yes, SAIC must constantly innovate and adapt commercial technology to the unique regulatory and security requirements of the federal government to maintain its competitive advantage and win future bids.

## Management Record

The management of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) presents a mixed, but currently transitional, picture for investors, marked by a solid preceding tenure and a recent abrupt leadership change amidst a strategic pivot.

### **Management Analysis for Investors**

#### **1. Current and Transitional CEO Leadership**

1.  **Current Interim CEO:** The board appointed James "Jim" Reagan as Interim CEO in October 2025 following a sudden transition, succeeding Toni Townes-Whitley. Reagan is a seasoned defense and government services executive and a former CFO of Leidos, providing industry expertise and board familiarity.
2.  **Investor Sentiment on Interim CEO:** Analysts view Reagan as a dependable, stable choice to ensure continuity during the search for a permanent leader but generally do not see him as a long-term solution. The Board reaffirmed the company's FY2026 financial guidance immediately following his appointment.

#### **2. Performance and Track Record of Recent CEOs**

3.  **Former CEO Nazzic Keene (2019-2023):** Keene's tenure is viewed as successful, delivering a total shareholder return increase of over 40%. She focused on profitable revenue growth and oversaw major strategic acquisitions, including Engility (2018) and Unisys Federal (2020), which expanded SAIC's scale and capabilities. Her transition in October 2023 was a planned retirement.
4.  **Departed CEO Toni Townes-Whitley (2023-2025):** Townes-Whitley's abrupt departure after just two years in October 2025 was a significant governance event that caused the stock to fall 7.5%. The board's stated reason was a desire for a "new direction," following weak Q1 2025 results and a reduction in the company's FY2026 revenue guidance.
5.  **Pre-Keene Leadership:** Nazzic Keene succeeded Tony Moraco, who retired in July 2019. Keene had been the architect of the successful merger and integration of Engility, which positioned her as the optimal successor.

#### **3. Strategy, Vision, and Delivery on Promises**

6.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** The company is executing the **"Enterprise Growth Strategy"** launched during Townes-Whitley's tenure, which centers on driving profitable *organic* growth by focusing on six key technology differentiators (e.g., Secure Multi-Cloud, Digital Engineering, Operational AI).
7.  **Key Strategic Decisions:** Management reorganized the company into five business groups aligned directly with key customers (Army, Navy, Air Force, Space & Intelligence, Civilian) to enhance market focus. They are also committed to a phased approach of building their portfolio, enhancing brand, and developing a winning culture.
8.  **Financial Goals:** The strategy sets a multi-year goal to achieve **$7.95 billion to $8.1 billion in sales by Fiscal Year 2027**, translating to a target Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.5% on the top line and 4.5% on the bottom line.
9.  **Delivery on Bidding/Bookings:** A key component of the new strategy is to "Bid More, Bid Better, and Win More," with management showing progress by increasing expected submitted bids to over $25 billion for FY2025 (up from a prior target of $22 billion).
10. **Capital Allocation:** The company continues to maintain its dividend program, having maintained payments for 13 consecutive years, and has an aggressive share repurchase program with a $1.2 billion authorization to return capital to shareholders.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)'s most recent proxy statements (DEF 14A), here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for SAIC**

#### **1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **Low Direct Ownership:** The beneficial ownership of common stock by all directors and executive officers **as a group** is low, generally reported to be **under 2%** of the total outstanding shares.
*   **Limited Individual Influence:** The proxy statement typically notes that **no individual director or executive officer beneficially owns more than one percent** of the common stock. This suggests that management does not have a high personal capital stake tied directly to the stock, which is common for large, widely-held public companies.
*   **Stock Ownership Guidelines:** To counter low absolute ownership, SAIC maintains **stock ownership guidelines** that *require* executive officers and directors to hold a significant amount of common stock, which encourages a long-term perspective.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure (Pay-for-Performance Focus)**

*   **Majority of Pay is At-Risk:** A majority of the executive officers' total direct compensation is non-fixed and at-risk, meaning it is tied to the attainment of performance measures, promoting the creation of long-term shareholder value.
*   **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus:** LTI awards form the largest component of executive pay, and they are typically weighted heavily towards **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)** (e.g., 60% of LTI awards in fiscal 2025) which incentivize multi-year performance.
*   **Performance Metrics:** The PSUs are linked to **specific measurable financial goals over a three-year performance cycle**. Key financial measures include company-wide metrics like **revenue**, **adjusted EBITDA**, and other adjusted financial figures, which are balanced to mitigate excessive risk-taking.
*   **Clawback Policy:** SAIC maintains a **compensation recoupment ("clawback") policy** that allows the recovery of incentive compensation if financial results are subsequently restated or if an executive is involved in misconduct. This acts as a strong disincentive for unethical behavior aimed at inflating short-term results.

#### **3. Conclusion on Alignment with Shareholder Interests**

*   **Strong Alignment through Compensation:** Despite the relatively small percentage of direct aggregate ownership by the group, the **compensation structure is strongly aligned** with shareholder interests. The emphasis on **long-term equity (PSUs)** that vest over a **three-year cycle** and use performance metrics like **EBITDA and revenue** drives executives to focus on sustained profitable growth, not just short-term gains.
*   **Mitigation of Risk:** The combination of an annual cash bonus tied to short-term results, the significant weighting on the three-year PSU vesting, stock ownership requirements, and the clawback policy collectively **discourages management from taking excessive or unnecessary risks** to line their pockets.
*   **Shareholder Support:** The executive compensation was approved by shareholders in the most recent advisory "Say-on-Pay" vote, indicating that shareholders generally view the structure as appropriate and aligned with their interests.
*   **Final Conclusion:** Management incentives are structurally designed to prioritize **long-term, sustained financial performance and stockholder value creation**, suggesting a genuine incentive to act in the shareholders' interest, although the *absolute level* of direct insider ownership is low, which is a common feature in this type of large public corporation.

## Price History

Based on technical analysis and recent price history for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), here is an analysis of the stock:

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **32.1%** above its 52-week low of \$84.12 (using a recent price of \$111.13).

2.  **52-Week Range:** The 52-week price range for SAIC is between a low of **\$84.12** and a high of **\$124.11**.

3.  **Technical Analysis Indicators (TradingView):** The overall technical rating is "Neutral". However, there is a noted "Bullish Crossover," where the short-term moving average has crossed above the long-term moving average, which can signal the beginning of a trend reversal.

4.  **Short-Term Technical Signals:** While the long-term outlook shows a bullish crossover, the short-term Moving Average holds a "sell" signal, and technical ratings for the 1-week and 1-month timeframes show a "sell" trend prevailing. This suggests the stock has recently enjoyed a strong move up and may be facing short-term resistance or consolidation.

5.  **Recent Stock Price Surge:** The stock has seen a significant upward move recently, rising nearly **9.79% in two weeks** leading up to mid-January 2026. This recent strength followed an earnings beat for Q3 FY2026, which caused shares to gap up in early December 2025, driven by margin expansion and portfolio restructuring efforts.

6.  **Explanation of a Major Drop:** A "big drop" of **13.26%** occurred around June 2, 2025, immediately following the announcement of Q1 FY2026 results. Despite strong bookings and reaffirmed full-year guidance, the market reacted negatively to a 12% year-over-year decline in net income and negative free cash flow.

---

## Long Thesis

SAIC's bull case is founded on its role as an indispensable, embedded technology partner for the U.S. government. In the near term, the stock will benefit from management's focus on operational efficiency and a strong share repurchase program, which are expected to boost earnings per share (EPS) significantly, hitting management's aggressive targets. This growth will accelerate as temporary contract transition hurdles clear up in the second half of the year. For the long term, SAIC is positioned perfectly to capitalize on enduring national priorities: massive government spending on modernizing outdated IT infrastructure, strengthening cybersecurity, and integrating advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) into defense and intelligence operations. The company's deep security clearances, flawless track record, and multi-year contract backlog (providing stable revenue visibility) create high barriers to entry, making it virtually impossible for competitors to displace them from mission-critical systems. SAIC is fundamentally a stable services firm that is successfully pivoting its business toward higher-profit, high-growth technology integration.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that U.S. government defense and civilian agencies will maintain or increase their budgets for IT modernization, digital transformation, and classified intelligence services. We also assume that SAIC's new strategic focus on 'bidding better' will translate into winning a higher ratio of large, high-margin contracts (meeting their goal of a 1.2 Book-to-Bill ratio) and that the efficiency drives and share repurchase program will successfully deliver the targeted double-digit EPS growth.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) contains several critical flaws, particularly concerning its ability to grow revenue, consistently win new high-value contracts, and navigate political budget risks.

### Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis (Bear Case Arguments)

1.  **Failure to Meet Core Growth Metric (Book-to-Bill):** The long-term strategy depends on achieving a Book-to-Bill ratio of 1.2, but the most recent full fiscal year and trailing twelve months (TTM) performance was significantly lower at **0.9**. This indicates SAIC is currently booking considerably less new work than the revenue it is burning down from its backlog, signaling a depletion of the contract pipeline rather than growth.
2.  **Lack of Organic Revenue Growth:** The thesis's claim that growth will "accelerate" is contradicted by financial guidance and recent results. SAIC's most recent full fiscal year organic revenue growth was modest (e.g., 3.1% for FY25), and guidance for the subsequent fiscal year has indicated a potential low-single-digit increase, or even an organic **contraction** of 2%-3%. This suggests the "temporary contract transition hurdles" are a persistent weakness in winning major recompetes.
3.  **Dependence on Finite EPS Boosters:** The significant growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) is heavily reliant on a material **share repurchase program** and operational efficiency gains, which drives down the share count and boosts profitability. These are finite levers. Without sustained and accelerating *revenue* growth (which the Book-to-Bill ratio contradicts), EPS growth will eventually stall once the company has maximized efficiency and slowed its rate of repurchases.
4.  **U.S. Government Budget Volatility Threatens Modernization:** The assumption of continuously increasing budgets is at risk due to the political environment. The reliance on **Continuing Resolutions (CRs)** restricts agencies to prior-year funding and prevents the start of new, large IT modernization or AI projects, forcing an emphasis on maintenance ("legacy" systems), which slows SAIC's pivot to high-growth areas. Furthermore, proposals for steep cuts to government-wide funds like the Technology Modernization Fund pose a risk to civilian agency spending.
5.  **"Flawless Track Record" is Overstated:** The bull case overlooks operational risks and legal history. The company has had to pay out settlements in the past for violating the **False Claims Act** and resolving breach of contract claims, which directly challenges the notion of a "flawless track record" and creates reputational risk when bidding for new government work.
6.  **Competitive Threat in High-Growth Areas:** While SAIC is actively pursuing AI and digital transformation, the high barriers to entry are not "virtually impossible." Smaller, nimbler, and pure-play technology firms—especially those partnered with major commercial cloud and AI providers—can now compete for modernization contracts via new acquisition vehicles that prioritize commercial, off-the-shelf solutions and speed, potentially displacing SAIC from its existing mission-critical systems.

***

### Bear Case Thesis

**SAIC is a mature, low-to-no-growth government services integrator using financial engineering to mask a core business development failure, making it highly vulnerable to government budget stagnation and increased competition.**

The bear case posits that SAIC's reliance on a massive share repurchase program and internal cost-cutting is a temporary measure to generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth that is unsustainable. The underlying weakness is reflected in a persistent failure to achieve its target Book-to-Bill ratio of 1.2, with the TTM Book-to-Bill near 0.9. This low ratio signals that the company is not winning new contracts fast enough to replace revenue drawn from its large backlog, setting the stage for long-term organic revenue contraction. Furthermore, the company's financial results are acutely exposed to government budget uncertainty, where political friction leads to **Continuing Resolutions (CRs)** that delay or cancel new, high-margin modernization and AI projects. This budget risk, coupled with an increasingly competitive landscape of specialized tech firms and cloud providers, challenges the long thesis's view of SAIC as an "indispensable" partner with high barriers to entry. Therefore, the stock is valued on an aggressive EPS number fueled by share count reduction, not on the sustainable, accelerating top-line growth needed to support a bullish valuation.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the core debate for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) centers on whether its financial engineering (buybacks/cost cuts) can sustain its EPS growth, or if its organic revenue weakness (low Book-to-Bill ratio) will ultimately lead to a significant slowdown.

The initial search provided critical, recent data that partly addresses your bear case, but also raises new questions.

Here are the most important questions and next steps you should investigate further:

### **I. Critical Financial and Competitive Landscape (Valuation & Peers)**

1.  **Peer Valuation Comparison:** Compare SAIC’s current valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Price-to-FCF) to its closest peers—specifically **Leidos (LDOS), CACI International (CACI), and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)**. SAIC is trading at a lower P/E ratio than both Leidos and CACI, suggesting it is currently the more affordable stock. However, Leidos and Booz Allen Hamilton have higher net profit margins than SAIC. *Investigate whether the lower valuation is justified by its lower margins and growth outlook.*
2.  **Backlog Quality and Profitability Mix:** Determine the exact composition of SAIC’s current contract portfolio and backlog. *Specifically, what percentage of the total backlog is comprised of **high-margin Fixed-Price (FP)** contracts versus **lower-margin Cost-Reimbursement (CR)** contracts?* This mix is a direct predictor of future profit margins and risk, as FP contracts carry higher risk but offer better margin potential.
3.  **Sustainability of Free Cash Flow (FCF) Boost:** The long thesis relies on FCF generation, but Q1 FY26 saw negative free cash flow. While the company raised its FCF guidance for the full year FY26, *investigate the specific one-time items (like legal settlements) that supported the recent EPS beat and the FCF guidance increase.* Determine if these drivers are truly sustainable or merely temporary boosts masking operational weakness.

### **II. Strategy, Growth, and Contract Execution**

4.  **Organic Growth vs. Book-to-Bill Volatility:** The analysis notes a Book-to-Bill goal of 1.2, but the trailing twelve months (TTM) ratio was as low as **0.8** in Q1 FY26 before recovering to **1.0** in Q2 FY26 and **1.2** in Q3 FY26. *Is the recent Book-to-Bill of 1.2 sustainable, or was it a one-time event driven by a few large, anticipated recompetes?* Further investigate management commentary on their pipeline quality for FY27 and beyond, especially new business versus recompete success.
5.  **Specific Technology Partnerships and Investments:** The bear case argues that competitors can displace SAIC. *Identify the specific, named **proprietary solutions** or deep **commercial partnerships (e.g., with AWS, Google, or NVIDIA for AI)** that SAIC is using to differentiate itself in the high-growth areas of AI, Cloud, and Digital Engineering.* This is crucial to justifying the "indispensable" claim in the long thesis.
6.  **Details on the CEO Transition:** The sudden departure of CEO Toni Townes-Whitley after just two years, officially for a "new direction" following weak Q1 results, is a significant governance flag. *Search for deeper analyst or media commentary on the specific reasons for the board's decision to gain clarity on whether the strategic pivot itself was the issue, or if it was purely a performance-based dismissal.*

### **III. Capital Allocation and Government Risk**

7.  **Detailed Share Repurchase Timeline:** Quantify the remaining share repurchase authorization and the actual pace of buybacks. The plan includes repurchasing approximately $500 million in shares in FY26 and FY27. *Analyze the exact timing and average price of the share repurchases in recent quarters to assess how effectively the company is using this key financial lever to support the EPS target.*
8.  **Impact of Continuing Resolutions (CRs) on Major Contracts:** The bear case cites the risk of CRs. *Determine the exposure of SAIC's *new business* pipeline to government programs most affected by budget delays (e.g., major DoD IT modernization programs, space, and classified programs).* The political risk to new, high-margin projects remains a significant, unquantified variable.
