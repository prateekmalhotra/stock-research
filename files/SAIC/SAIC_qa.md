## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) functions as a major technology and engineering solutions provider, primarily serving the United States federal government, including the Department of Defense, NASA, and various intelligence agencies. It operates almost exclusively in the U.S. market under a Business-to-Government (B2G) model. The core business model involves bidding competitively for large, multi-year service contracts to modernize and manage critical government systems, ranging from advanced weapons platforms support to crucial cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure management. Revenue is generated by providing specialized human capital and technology integration services rather than selling standardized consumer products.

---

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk for SAIC stems from its almost total reliance on the annual U.S. federal budget, especially defense spending, and the intense competition in the government services sector. If Congress implements significant budget cuts (sequestration) or if political gridlock leads to a government shutdown, funding for existing and future contracts can be immediately delayed or cancelled; these interruptions have occurred historically and directly hurt cash flow. A long-term threat is the necessity of consistently winning large, complex contracts against specialized competitors, as losing a major bid directly hampers future revenue visibility. Furthermore, success is threatened by the difficulty of attracting and retaining highly specialized employees with security clearances, as a shortage of approved personnel prevents them from executing critical, sensitive projects for the government, thereby damaging their market position and earnings potential.

## Company History

This history of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) will explain its origins, challenges, and growth in simple, jargon-free English.

***

### **The History of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)**

#### **Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **A Frustrated Scientist's Vision (1969):** SAIC was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert "Bob" Beyster, a physicist who was previously working on government projects at another company in San Diego.
2.  **The Founding Goal:** Dr. Beyster was unhappy that his former employer was shifting its focus away from critical government research, so he started SAIC with a simple goal: to provide high-quality, independent scientific and technical advice directly to the U.S. government.
3.  **Turning Science into Solutions:** The new company was established to transform "science to solutions," focusing initially on scientific projects for the U.S. military, like studying the effects of nuclear power and weapons.

#### **The First Innovative Solution (The Business Model)**

4.  **The Entrepreneurial Culture (Tailwind):** A core feature of SAIC's success was its unique, employee-owned business model for its first decades. This structure gave stock ownership to employees, which encouraged top scientists and engineers to stay, work hard, and act like company owners, fostering an entrepreneurial culture.
5.  **Steady Growth and Diversification (Tailwind):** Leveraging the need for specialized scientific support during the Cold War era, SAIC grew steadily by winning contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD), intelligence agencies, and the Department of Energy. The company quickly expanded beyond defense into areas like energy, environmental services, and healthcare technology to avoid relying too heavily on any single area of government spending.

#### **Headwinds and the Path to the Public Market**

6.  **The Employee Ownership Problem (Headwind):** After decades of success, the employee-ownership model created a significant problem in the early 2000s. As many long-time employees reached retirement age, they wanted to sell their stock, but there were not enough new employees to buy it, creating a "liquidity" crunch.
7.  **Going Public for Liquidity (Solution, 2006):** To solve this problem and give its employee-owners a way to cash out their shares fairly, SAIC made the decision to become a publicly traded company through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2006. This move also fueled the company's further growth and expansion.

#### **The Transformative Split (A Major Headwind and Solution)**

8.  **The Conflict-of-Interest Headwind:** As a huge government contractor, SAIC faced a regulatory problem: government rules often prevent a company from advising the government on a new system (like a consultant) and then also bidding to build that exact system (like a manufacturer). This conflict-of-interest rule limited SAIC's ability to compete for all types of government work.
9.  **The Innovative Split (Solution, 2013):** To overcome this limitation, SAIC made the transformative decision to split into two completely separate, independent, and publicly traded companies in 2013.
10. **The Two New Companies:**
    *   The original parent company was renamed **Leidos**, which focused on developing and engineering technology and systems.
    *   The spin-off company was the **'new' SAIC**, which retained the legacy name and concentrated on providing services, consulting, and integrating technology built by others for the government. This separation allowed both companies to freely bid on a much wider range of government contracts without the old conflict issues.

#### **SAIC Today**

11. **Present-Day Focus:** The current SAIC is a premier technology integrator whose primary customer is the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and various civilian agencies.
12. **Strategy for Growth (Innovative Solution):** The company actively makes strategic acquisitions of smaller, specialized firms to quickly gain expertise in high-demand areas, such as classified intelligence work (Scitor in 2015), space systems (Engility in 2019), and cloud computing/IT services (Unisys Federal in 2020).
13. **Company Goal:** SAIC's core mission is to act as a technology integrator, meaning they bring together different technologies and services (whether from their own team or outside partners) to solve the nation's most complex challenges in national security, defense, and civilian government operations.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is built primarily on **High Switching Costs** and **Intangible Assets** in the highly regulated U.S. government services sector.

---

### **Analysis of SAIC's Moat and Differentiation**

#### **1. Competitive Differentiation and Special Position**

*   **Pure-Play Mission Integrator:** SAIC’s special position is as one of the largest pure-play technology service providers to the U.S. government, focusing almost exclusively on federal, defense, space, and intelligence agencies (approximately 98% of revenue).
*   **Focus on High-End Mission Work:** Management is actively shifting its portfolio away from large, commoditized (easily copied) Enterprise IT contracts and toward higher-end, complex **Mission IT and Engineering** services. This is done to achieve stronger differentiation and higher profit margins.
*   **"System of Systems" Integrator:** The company's unique value is not in creating proprietary hardware, but in being a "mission integrator" that securely and rapidly combines various emerging technologies (like AI, cloud, and digital engineering) from different vendors into a seamless, mission-critical solution for the government.

#### **2. Customer Stickiness and Recurrence**

*   **Enduring Customer Relationships:** The company has built deep, long-standing relationships and institutional knowledge with specific U.S. government agencies (like the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy) over decades, which is critical in this sector.
*   **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The vast majority of business is recurring, derived from long-term, multi-year contracts, such as **Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)** vehicles. Once embedded in a government agency's vital systems, the cost and risk of switching to a new vendor are prohibitively high.
*   **Large Contract Backlog:** SAIC maintains a large backlog of secured contract work, which provides high predictability and stability to its future revenue streams.

#### **3. Barriers to Entry and Displacement**

*   **The Security Clearance Barrier:** A massive barrier to entry is SAIC's workforce, with a high percentage of employees cleared to work on classified national security projects. A new competitor, even with significant capital, would take years to recruit and clear an equivalent workforce.
*   **Mastery of Procurement Process:** SAIC's ability to secure prime positions on crucial, multi-billion-dollar government contract vehicles (like GSA ASTRO) gives it automatic access to a massive pipeline of task orders that smaller or newer firms cannot bid on. This regulatory hurdle is a powerful barrier.
*   **Difficulty for a Competitor with More Capital:** While capital is needed for acquisitions and scale, simply having more money would not easily displace SAIC. The true displacement cost is measured in **time** (to build relationships), **trust** (to handle classified missions), and **personnel security clearance**—factors capital alone cannot quickly buy.

#### **4. Pricing Power, R&D, and Growth**

*   **Pricing Power is Limited but Earned:** The government contracting market is highly competitive and is generally focused on securing the lowest price, which limits true pricing power. However, under **Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP)** contracts, SAIC can earn higher profits by executing the work more efficiently and below the negotiated cost, effectively creating an internal cost-advantage moat.
*   **R&D and Innovation are Necessary:** SAIC operates in a domain where constant innovation is required to maintain its edge. It invests in research and development and uses its own technology platforms (e.g., Koverse for cybersecurity and Tenjin for AI development) to enhance its offerings. Its edge comes from being the trusted partner who can rapidly and securely *integrate* the newest technology for mission-critical use.
*   **Reason for Growth:** SAIC grew into what it is today by successfully navigating the complex government landscape and executing strategic acquisitions (like Engility) that immediately increased its scale, cleared personnel base, and ability to compete for the largest, most complex classified contracts.

## Management Record

This analysis summarizes the management of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) using information relevant to a potential investor.

### Management Analysis for SAIC

1.  **CEO Transition (2025):** The company recently underwent an abrupt CEO transition in October 2025, with Toni Townes-Whitley stepping down after approximately two years in the role, and former CFO and board member James "Jim" Reagan appointed as Interim CEO.
2.  **Reason for CEO Change:** While the company stated the separation with Townes-Whitley was "without cause," she later indicated the board sought a "different direction," following a period of slow on-contract revenue growth and lowered full-year revenue guidance.
3.  **Interim CEO's Background & Action:** Interim CEO Jim Reagan is a seasoned executive with nearly 20 years of experience in the defense and government services industry, including prior CFO roles at Leidos and Vencore. He immediately took action to reverse organic growth declines by announcing a plan to reprogram $100 million in indirect spend towards business development and R&D.
4.  **Prior CEO's (Nazzic Keene) Track Record:** Nazzic Keene, CEO from 2019 to 2023, delivered a total shareholder return (TSR) increase of over 40% during her tenure. Her leadership was marked by major, value-enhancing acquisitions, including Engility and Unisys Federal, and a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
5.  **Historical Corporate Management:** The foundation of the current SAIC dates back to a major strategic split from its parent company (which became Leidos Holdings) in 2013, which was necessary to navigate Federal Acquisition Regulation conflicts of interest and focus the new entity on direct support to government organizations.
6.  **Future Strategy and Vision (Pivot):** The strategic direction, initially laid out in 2024, centers on accelerating profitable organic growth by making strategic pivots in the portfolio and go-to-market approach. A key recent change is moving from a focus on large, commoditized Enterprise IT deals toward higher-margin Mission IT and Engineering work.
7.  **Delivery on Promises (Mixed Performance):** The company's recent track record is mixed: it reported strong profitability and raised its Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash flow guidance for Fiscal Year 2027. However, it also significantly trimmed its FY2027 revenue outlook due to losses in Enterprise IT recompetes and market disruptions, indicating challenges in top-line growth.
8.  **Management Structure and Alignment:** In February 2024, the company reorganized its structure into five customer-centric business groups (Army, Navy, Air Force, Space & Intelligence, and Civilian) to better align with customer needs and execute its strategic vision.
9.  **Key Decisions (M&A):** Management has demonstrated an aggressive strategy of strategic acquisitions to expand its capabilities in the intelligence industry (Scitor, 2015) and broaden its federal services market presence (Engility, 2018; Unisys Federal, 2020).
10. **Investor/Market Perception:** The recent sudden leadership change caused the stock to fall, introducing uncertainty, though the board's reaffirmation of financial guidance and the Interim CEO's insider stock purchase may provide some stability to the market.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) management incentive and compensation structure is based on recent regulatory filings, including the Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (SAIC)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Total Insider Ownership:** The total beneficial ownership by Insiders (including all directors and executive officers) is relatively low, at approximately **0.86%** of the company's stock. This figure is not uncommon for a large, publicly traded company like SAIC, but a higher percentage would indicate stronger absolute alignment.
2.  **Strong Stock Ownership Guidelines:** SAIC maintains formal stock ownership guidelines for its management and directors to ensure a continuous financial stake in the company.
3.  **Significant Required Holdings:** Non-employee directors are required to hold shares with a value of at least **five times (5x)** their annual cash retainer fee. Executive Officers are also required to meet a minimum ownership threshold based on a multiple of their base salary.
4.  **Retention Requirement:** Executive Officers are mandated to **retain 100% of the net shares** they receive from equity awards (after tax withholding and option exercise costs) until their specified ownership guideline is achieved, forcing them to build and maintain their personal stake.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

1.  **Performance-Based Structure:** The compensation program for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is weighted significantly toward "at-risk" pay, consisting of a mix of annual base salary, short-term incentive (cash bonus), and long-term incentive (equity awards).
2.  **Annual Incentive Metrics (Short-Term):** The Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) is heavily weighted to key operational and financial metrics, with a focus on three equally weighted components (33.3% each).
3.  **Key Financial Goals for AIP:** The AIP is tied to company performance in **Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA**, and **Adjusted Operating Cash Flow**, which incentivizes managers to focus on top-line growth, profitability, and cash generation.
4.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTIP) Awards:** A substantial portion of total compensation is paid in equity, specifically through **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)** and **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**, which typically vest over multiple years. The use of PSUs ties a significant portion of long-term pay to multi-year financial goals, and RSUs directly align management's financial outcome with the stock's price appreciation.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

1.  **Incentives are Shareholder-Aligned:** SAIC's management is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, primarily because a significant and mandatory portion of their wealth is directly dependent on the company's multi-year financial performance and stock price appreciation.
2.  **Mitigation of Short-Term Focus:** The structure balances short-term operational goals (AIP metrics like Revenue and Cash Flow) with a powerful multi-year component (LTIP/PSUs/RSUs), discouraging executives from prioritizing immediate gains at the expense of long-term value.
3.  **Shareholder Satisfaction:** The compensation package for the named executive officers has been approved by shareholders in the annual "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote, suggesting that investors view the program as appropriate and aligned with their interests.
4.  **No Conclusion of "Lining Pockets":** While the absolute insider ownership percentage is small, the combination of robust stock ownership guidelines (including a 100% net share retention rule) and compensation tied to objective financial metrics suggests the system is designed for a performance-based reward structure rather than merely lining management's own pockets.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) stock:

1.  **Current Price Context:** The stock recently experienced a significant drop, hitting a new 52-week low of approximately **$81.08** on February 12, 2026, with the last traded price around **$82.22** on that day.
2.  **Proximity to Low:** The closing price of approximately $82.22 means the stock is currently trading only about **1.41%** above its recent 52-week low of $81.08.
3.  **Technical Analysis:** From a technical perspective, SAIC appears to be trading "low" and is considered **oversold**; the RSI14 (Relative Strength Index) indicator was at a highly oversold level of 10, which often suggests a potential for a near-term bounce.
4.  **Signal/Momentum:** Despite the oversold condition, technical signals from moving averages and momentum indicators recently issued a "sell signal" from a pivot top and the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), indicating a downward trend.
5.  **Big Drop Explanation (Last Few Months):** The stock had a sharp decline of over 16% in one day due to a **material cut to the fiscal year 2027 revenue guidance**.
6.  **Reason for the Cut:** The reduced revenue outlook was primarily attributed to two unfavorable Enterprise IT contract recompete losses, ongoing procurement delays in government contracts, and slower customer outlays.
7.  **Financial Contrast:** This negative growth outlook overshadowed a very strong preliminary fourth quarter for fiscal year 2026, where the company announced an adjusted EPS that exceeded guidance and a higher cash flow outlook for fiscal year 2027.

---

## Long Thesis

SAIC is well-positioned for both a near-term recovery and long-term profit growth. In the short term, the stock is currently oversold due to temporary losses of easily copied, low-margin contracts. A rebound is expected as these financial headwinds fade and new, large, high-value programs begin to ramp up revenue contribution. Over the long term, the core thesis is that management will successfully execute a critical strategic pivot: moving away from standardized, commoditized IT services toward complex, high-margin 'Mission IT and Engineering' work, which includes integrating advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and securing critical space/intelligence systems. This successful transition, underpinned by stable and growing U.S. defense spending, will expand the company's overall profit margins and generate consistent, strong Free Cash Flow. Management will deploy this cash flow effectively for share buybacks and targeted acquisitions, driving higher Earnings Per Share and strong shareholder returns.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case depends on several critical assumptions: 1) The U.S. government must maintain or increase its current high level of spending on defense, intelligence, and technology modernization without major budget cuts (sequestration) or prolonged political gridlock (shutdowns). 2) SAIC’s new leadership team successfully executes the strategic pivot, consistently winning enough high-value, high-margin contracts (AI, engineering, space) to more than offset the revenue lost from older, commoditized IT contracts. 3) The company must continue to successfully attract and retain its critical workforce of highly skilled employees with necessary security clearances, as this talent is the foundational barrier protecting their market share. 4) The large new contracts that have been awarded must accelerate their revenue contribution faster than market expectations, confirming the effectiveness of the strategic pivot.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several faults and underlying risks in the bull case for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), focusing on recent company guidance and market dynamics.

## Bear Case Thesis and Critique of Long Thesis

The bull case relies on a successful, quick transition to higher-margin work and the assumption that near-term revenue loss is temporary. The bear case argues that the core assumption of a smooth transition is undermined by internal leadership instability, execution risks from slow program ramps, and intense competition, leading to sustained pressure on the top line while the targeted margin expansion is not guaranteed to be enough to drive meaningful shareholder return.

| Bull Case Assumption | Bear Case Critique |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Near-term recovery** is expected as **financial headwinds fade** and new programs **ramp up revenue contribution faster than market expectations.** | **The Headwinds are Structural and Extended.** SAIC's own revised guidance projects a material, prolonged organic revenue decline (e.g., -4% to -2% for FY2027) due to recent Enterprise IT contract losses (like Cloud One and RITS). The expected ramp-up of new, large contracts (e.g., Air Force TENCAP) is explicitly slower than management had planned, directly contradicting the recovery timeline and assumption that new revenue will accelerate quickly. |
| **Management successfully executes a critical strategic pivot** from commoditized IT toward complex, high-margin "Mission IT and Engineering." | **Leadership Instability and Execution Risk.** The strategic pivot is occurring during a period of leadership uncertainty, as the previous CEO departed after only two years, and the company is currently being led by an interim CEO while a search is underway. Such a critical transformation requires a stable, long-term executive vision. |
| **Stable and growing U.S. defense spending** will underpin growth. | **Spending Focus is Misaligned with SAIC's Revenue Base.** While overall defense spending is projected to increase substantially, the largest proportional increases are focused on **Procurement** and **RDT&E** (weapons/R&D). SAIC's core services business may see less benefit from this allocation, and the transition creates a period of revenue contraction as older, larger Enterprise IT contracts roll off. |
| The core market share is protected by a need to **attract and retain a critical workforce** with security clearances. | **Intense Competition and Labor Constraints.** The move to "Mission IT and Engineering" and AI is a highly competitive space, with new rivals like hyperscalers (e.g., Google, Anthropic) directly entering the government AI market. Furthermore, the company has cited "labor constraints" and a slower federal acquisition workforce as part of the reason for its delayed program ramps, indicating a fundamental challenge in securing and placing the high-value cleared talent needed for its new strategy. |
| The shift will **expand the company's overall profit margins** and drive higher EPS. | **Margin Improvement is Counteracted by Top-Line Decline.** Management's expectation for higher margins is primarily driven by the lower-margin Enterprise IT contracts rolling off, rather than necessarily an increase in margin on the *new* Mission IT work. The significant cut to the revenue outlook for FY2027 means that even with slight margin expansion, the absolute profit growth and subsequent EPS increases from share buybacks may be insufficient to offset the shrinking revenue base. |

***

### Bear Case Thesis Points

1.  **Revenue Contraction is Structural, Not Temporary:** The company's reduction of its fiscal year 2027 revenue guidance, projecting an organic decline of up to -4%, confirms that the financial headwinds from lost commoditized contracts are material and will persist for multiple years, undermining the "near-term recovery" thesis.
2.  **Mission Pivot Execution is Delayed and Unstable:** Key new programs in the high-value "Mission IT" portfolio are ramping up slower than management anticipated, which directly contradicts the assumption that new revenue would accelerate and compounds the negative impact of lost recompetes.
3.  **Critical Leadership Gap at Key Juncture:** The strategic pivot is being overseen by an interim CEO following the departure of the previous CEO, introducing a significant risk of stalled execution, strategic shifts, or a loss of focus until a permanent chief executive is named.
4.  **Heightened Competition in High-Margin Sectors:** The shift to Mission IT/AI exposes SAIC to far more intense competition, not just from traditional rivals like Leidos and Booz Allen, but also from major commercial technology players and startups that are directly securing government AI contracts.
5.  **Capital Deployment Cannot Outrun Revenue Loss:** While share buybacks are an effective use of free cash flow, the projected high single-digit revenue decline for FY2027 suggests that management may rely too heavily on financial engineering (buybacks) to drive EPS growth, which is unsustainable if the underlying revenue base continues to shrink.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the critical tension point for SAIC is the success of its strategic pivot—shifting from high-volume, low-margin IT to high-margin, mission-oriented engineering—amid revenue headwinds and a leadership transition.

Here are the next important questions and investigative steps you should take:

### 1. Quantify the Impact of the Strategic Pivot and Contract Wins

You have confirmed the headwind is structural, now quantify the tailwind to judge the recovery speed.

*   **Net Revenue Impact Calculation:** While you know the revenue guidance was cut, try to calculate the net headwind. Contract losses like the Army Corps of Engineers recompete and **Cloud One** are expected to impact revenue by approximately 3% and 1% of the top line, respectively. You also know that **CastleNet (RITS)** is estimated to impact revenue by $200 million year-over-year, and Cloud One by approximately $75 million.
*   **Book-to-Bill Conversion Rate:** Investigate the conversion rate and timeline of their strong bookings. SAIC has maintained a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 or higher for three consecutive quarters, and its backlog is at a healthy $23.8 billion. The key unanswered question is: **When** will this large backlog and new contract wins (like Air Force TENCAP) actually turn into reported revenue growth, given the acknowledged "slower-than-planned ramp-ups"?

### 2. Investigate the New CEO Appointment Status and Strategy

The ongoing leadership search is a major risk cited in the bear case.

*   **Permanent CEO Appointment:** Although you know the Board is using an external firm to search for a new, permanent CEO, you should check for any new announcements. The lack of a permanent CEO introduces uncertainty and could stall the critical strategic pivot, which requires a stable, long-term vision.

### 3. Assess the Competitive Landscape and Relative Valuation

The stock's current low price suggests undervaluation, but this must be confirmed relative to peers.

*   **Peer Valuation Multiples:** Compare SAIC's current valuation (P/E ratio is between 10x and 12x) against its closest competitors, **Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)** (P/E is around 12.8x) and **Leidos (LDOS)** (P/E is between 15x and 20x). The lower multiple for SAIC suggests the market sees a greater level of risk or lower growth potential, confirming the need to resolve the growth/pivot risk.
*   **Analyst Price Targets:** Search for the consensus analyst price target to see the market's professional expectation for a price rebound, and try to find recent notes that explain the rationale for the significant stock drop.

### 4. Detail the AI Strategy and Tech Moat Against Hyperscalers

The bear case highlights new competition from Big Tech (hyperscalers) in the AI market, which directly challenges SAIC's *Intangible Assets* moat.

*   **SAIC's "Integrator" Differentiation:** Investigate how SAIC's new tech offerings, like the **Tenjin** AI/ML development platform and the **Koverse** security-first data platform, create a unique value proposition that cannot be replicated by Big Tech. Your analysis already notes SAIC's "mission integrator" value, and the company has highlighted its alliance with Google Public Sector to deliver "AI at the Edge" using specialized, ruggedized hardware for the defense sector.
*   **Moat in Operationalizing AI:** Search for evidence or case studies that detail SAIC's ability to operationalize AI in "contested and multi-domain environments". This is the core of their defense-specific moat: the ability to deploy, govern, and orchestrate AI models in a secure, classified environment that Big Tech typically struggles to achieve on its own.

### 5. Confirm the Financial Engineering (Share Buyback) Pace

The bull case heavily relies on cash flow being returned to shareholders to drive EPS growth.

*   **Current Buyback Pace:** You know SAIC reaffirmed its plan to repurchase approximately **$1 billion in shares over FY26 and FY27**. You should find out the actual dollars spent on share repurchases in the most recent reported quarter to see if they are accelerating the pace to meet their long-term EPS target or being cautious due to the revenue/CEO uncertainty.
