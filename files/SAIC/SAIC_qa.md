## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) operates almost entirely as a service provider for the U.S. government, primarily serving the Department of Defense, various intelligence agencies, and other federal civilian groups. They are not a B2B (business-to-business) or B2C (business-to-consumer) company. SAIC's core business model is centered on winning large, long-term government contracts to integrate complex technology systems, modernize old IT infrastructure, and provide expert engineering and mission support. Their revenue is generated by billing the government based on the agreed-upon costs and fees associated with these specific contractual services, meaning their performance and growth are directly linked to the federal budget.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term and long-term risk for SAIC is its deep dependency on stable U.S. federal spending and political budget cycles. If the government reduces funding for defense or IT modernization (as historically seen during periods of budget sequestration), SAIC's pipeline of new contracts shrinks immediately, directly harming earnings. Near-term risks also include intense competition in the contracting space, where losing a single major contract bid or having a successful contract award overturned by a competitor's protest can halt significant expected revenue. A critical long-term concern is maintaining the security required for handling sensitive national defense information; any high-profile security breach, which has become an increasing threat globally, could result in the loss of security clearances, penalties, and termination from existing contracts, severely damaging SAIC's ability to secure future government work.

## Company History

The history of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is one of constant evolution, driven by the unique needs of the U.S. government, its primary customer.

### **Inception and Founding Purpose (1969)**

1.  **The Origin and Purpose:** Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster, a nuclear physicist, in San Diego, California. The company started as a small firm focused on providing high-level scientific and technical expertise to the U.S. government.
2.  **The Core Goal:** Dr. Beyster's initial goal was to bring together highly skilled scientists and engineers to tackle the nation's most complex problems, operating on the principle of turning "science to solutions."
3.  **Early Work:** The first contracts focused on vital national security projects, such as studying the effects of nuclear weapons and underwater explosions for the U.S. Navy.

### **Innovative Founding Structure**

4.  **The Employee-Ownership Model:** A key innovation for its time, SAIC fostered an entrepreneurial culture by adopting an employee-ownership model, where a large portion of the stock was held by its workforce.
5.  **The Benefit:** This structure was designed to attract and retain the best scientific talent by giving them a personal stake in the company’s success, encouraging greater accountability and innovation in their solutions.

### **The Early Tailwinds and Diversification**

6.  **Cold War Tailwinds:** The decades-long high-level of U.S. military and defense spending during the Cold War provided a massive, sustained "tailwind," offering SAIC a continuous flow of contracts for scientific research and development.
7.  **Strategic Expansion:** To avoid becoming dependent on any single government area, SAIC steadily broadened its portfolio in the 1970s and 1980s, expanding into areas like energy, environmental services, and healthcare technology.

### **Major Headwinds and Challenges**

8.  **Reputational Headwinds:** The company faced significant challenges in the public eye, including a 1990 felony conviction for environmental fraud and, later, the major 2012 "CityTime" payroll scandal, where it was ordered to pay a large settlement for overbilling a New York City contract.

### **The Great Split: An Innovative Regulatory Solution**

9.  **The Regulatory Problem (Headwind):** By the early 2010s, the company had grown so large and diverse that it faced a major regulatory problem known as "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (OCI). A government contractor could not, for instance, advise an agency on designing a new system (consulting) and then bid to build that very same system (integration).
10. **The Innovative Solution (The Spin-off):** In 2013, the company took the drastic step of splitting into two completely independent, publicly traded companies to resolve this issue and allow both to compete for more work.
11. **The New SAIC’s Focus:** The original parent company changed its name to Leidos, focusing on the engineering and product side. The separated, "new" company retained the **SAIC** name and focused on providing high-end **government services and consulting**, like IT support, digital transformation, and technical advice.

### **The Modern SAIC and Digital Tailwinds (Present)**

12. **The Current Goal:** Today's SAIC operates as a premier **technology integrator** for the government, meaning its primary goal is to combine various technologies (software, hardware, cloud) and technical support services to help agencies meet their mission goals.
13. **New Tailwinds in IT and Digital Transformation:** The largest "tailwind" today is the government's need for a complete digital overhaul, known as **Digital Transformation**. SAIC is positioned to capitalize on this by providing services like cloud migration, advanced cybersecurity, data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration.
14. **Strategic Growth:** The company has made strategic acquisitions, such as Engility Holdings (2019) and Unisys Federal (2020), to rapidly expand its expertise and market share in space, federal civilian services, cloud computing, and digital engineering.
15. **A Clear Mission:** With approximately 98% of its revenue coming from the U.S. government, SAIC's core mission remains the same as its founding: to transform science and technology into ready-to-use solutions for national security, defense, and civilian government operations.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is primarily built on the unique and high-barrier nature of the U.S. Federal Government services market. It is less about developing proprietary products and more about being a deeply embedded, trusted technology integrator with specialized human capital.

### Analysis of SAIC's Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Deep, High-Friction Customer Relationships (High Switching Costs)**
    *   SAIC’s primary business (over 95% of revenue) is with the U.S. Government, particularly the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community.
    *   The services are often mission-critical (like running an agency’s entire IT or providing complex systems integration), making the cost and risk of switching to a new vendor prohibitively high for the government.
    *   This is reinforced by the need for a massive workforce of **personnel with high-level security clearances**, a scarce resource that new entrants cannot easily acquire, leading to extreme customer stickiness.

2.  **Contractual Barriers to Entry (The "Network" Effect)**
    *   The U.S. Government uses large, multi-year, multi-billion-dollar contract vehicles, such as Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.
    *   Being a pre-qualified, prime contractor on these select vehicles is a massive barrier to entry, as a competitor must win a "seat at the table" before they can even bid on the specific task orders that generate revenue.
    *   This system creates a powerful, self-reinforcing advantage where past success leads to a seat on the next major contract vehicle, ensuring recurring opportunities and making it difficult for new companies to get their foot in the door.

3.  **Nature of Contracts: Sticky and Recurring Revenue**
    *   SAIC operates with a very high contract backlog, estimated at over **$20 billion** (funded and unfunded), which provides exceptional revenue visibility for years to come.
    *   The work is typically not "one-time" but involves long-term, multi-year service contracts for IT modernization, logistics, and mission support, leading to a high percentage of recurring revenue.

### Special Pricing Power and Market Position

4.  **Limited Pricing Power due to Market Structure**
    *   The government services market is highly competitive and operates under constant pressure from budget cycles and government mandates for efficiency.
    *   SAIC's profit margins (Adjusted EBITDA margin around 9-10%) are relatively low compared to product-based software companies, indicating that competition forces them to price competitively and their moat is structural rather than based on a premium brand price tag.
    *   However, within many contracts (especially "cost-plus" models), SAIC is guaranteed a small profit margin, offering financial stability even if it limits upside.

5.  **Differentiation from Competitors (Leidos, Booz Allen)**
    *   SAIC's strategic differentiation lies in its focus as a **Technology and IT Integrator**.
    *   Unlike companies that focus on high-end consulting (like Booz Allen Hamilton) or heavy-duty national security platforms (like Leidos, its spun-off sibling), SAIC specializes in taking the best commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cloud, AI, and cybersecurity technologies and securely integrating them into the government's highly complex and aging infrastructure.

### Growth, Innovation, and Displacement Risk

6.  **Historical Reason for Growth**
    *   The original company (before its 2013 split into SAIC and Leidos) grew swiftly by capitalizing on the U.S. government's historical shift toward **outsourcing** scientific, engineering, and IT services, winning multi-billion dollar foundational contracts which propelled the firm into the top tier.
    *   The current SAIC has continued to grow by executing **capability-focused acquisitions** (like Engility and Unisys Federal) to instantly gain specialized contracts, new customers, and a larger pool of cleared personnel.

7.  **R&D and Necessity for Innovation**
    *   SAIC's moat is **not dependent on massive internal R&D spending** like a traditional technology company.
    *   Instead, its innovation strategy is to use an "Innovation Factory" to quickly adapt and integrate rapidly evolving commercial technology (cloud, AI, etc.) into government missions.
    *   The core of its "innovation" is the **secure, high-end engineering expertise** required to deploy these commercial tools within the government's stringent security and regulatory environment.

8.  **Displacement by Capital is Difficult**
    *   A competitor with a large amount of capital **cannot easily displace SAIC**, as the main barrier is not financial capital but **human and political capital**.
    *   It takes decades to build the deep institutional trust, win seats on essential contract vehicles, and amass the large, cleared workforce (especially for classified work) required to compete at SAIC's scale.
    *   Displacement is slow and programmatic, generally only happening when a competitor is awarded a massive contract recompete (renewal) that SAIC loses.

## Management Record

Based on analysis for an investor, here is an overview of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) management, its history, performance, and strategy.

### **Management Track Record and History**

1.  **Planned CEO Transition (2023):** The board executed a planned CEO succession in October 2023, as **Nazzic Keene** retired after a decade at SAIC, including four years as CEO. Her tenure was noted for aligning the company’s portfolio and advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which reportedly contributed to increased shareholder value.
2.  **Toni Townes-Whitley's Short Tenure (2023–2025):** **Toni Townes-Whitley**, a high-profile technology veteran and former Microsoft executive, succeeded Keene in October 2023 with a mandate to accelerate momentum and growth. During her tenure (Oct 2023 to Oct 2025), the stock price reportedly grew by over 30%.
3.  **Sudden CEO Change (2025):** The board forced the sudden departure of Townes-Whitley in October 2025, stating they wished to move the company in a "different direction." This came shortly after the company lowered its fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance, citing a more challenging revenue environment, suggesting a performance gap against expectations.
4.  **Interim CEO Background:** **James "Jim" Reagan** was immediately appointed Interim CEO and is a highly-experienced industry veteran, notably serving as the former CFO of rival Leidos, and was already a member of SAIC's board. His deep knowledge in defense and government services, including cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure, is seen as aligning with current DoD priorities.

### **Key Decisions and Strategy**

5.  **Organizational Consolidation (Major Pivot):** Interim CEO Jim Reagan's first major move (Nov 2025) was to announce a strategic reorganization, consolidating Townes-Whitley's five customer-facing business groups (Army, Navy, etc.) back into three (Army-Navy, Air Force-Space-Intelligence, and Civilian).
6.  **Focus on Efficiency and Growth:** The stated rationale for the consolidation is to "optimize for speed, flexibility and efficiency" and to better align investments for sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value creation.
7.  **Executive Departures:** This restructuring resulted in the departures of three key executives, including the Chief Innovation Officer and two Executive Vice Presidents who led the Army and Space & Intelligence groups, which may signal a shift away from certain priorities or the previous leadership's team.
8.  **Future Vision and Financial Targets:** The company’s long-term vision, launched in 2024, focuses on a multi-year growth strategy built around investments in technology capabilities, business development, and talent. Financial targets aim for a 3.5% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) on the top line and 4.5% CAGR on adjusted EBITDA by 2027.
9.  **Technology and Mission Focus:** The strategic vision emphasizes "National Imperatives" like All-Domain Warfighting, Undersea Dominance, and Next-Generation Space, with an additional focus on developing "Ethical AI" solutions.

### **Shareholder Value and Market Perception**

10. **Capital Deployment:** SAIC maintains a history of disciplined capital deployment aimed at creating shareholder value through a balanced mix of dividends, share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions.
11. **Market Reaction to Recent Change:** The sudden CEO change in late 2025 raised "leadership uncertainty" for investors and was followed by a stock drop of over 6% in the immediate aftermath, though the company did reaffirm its near-term fiscal 2026 guidance.
12. **Analyst Concerns:** The rapid succession of CEOs and the related executive departures following the consolidation of business groups may signal instability or underlying performance challenges requiring drastic changes, which may be a point of caution for long-term investors.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) recent definitive proxy statements (DEF 14A), here is the breakdown of management incentive and compensation:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (SAIC)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership and Holding Requirements**

1.  **High Stock Ownership Guidelines:** SAIC maintains rigorous stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers, requiring them to hold a significant multiple of their annual base salary in company stock. The CEO's target is **seven times (7x)** her annual base salary, while other Executive Leadership Team (ELT) members are required to hold **four times (4x)** their salary.
2.  **Director Ownership Requirements:** Non-employee directors are required to hold shares with a value of at least **five times (5x)** their annual cash retainer, or a minimum of **10,000 shares**, reinforcing a financial stake in the company's long-term stock performance.
3.  **Mandatory Retention Policy:** Executive officers are required to retain **100% of the net shares** received from equity awards until their respective ownership multiple is met, which helps ensure that new awards translate directly into increased long-term ownership.
4.  **Conclusion on Ownership:** The high stock ownership multiples (7x for CEO) and the mandatory retention requirements are strong evidence that management's personal wealth is heavily tied to the long-term appreciation of SAIC’s stock, strongly aligning their interests with those of the shareholders.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

1.  **Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:** The compensation philosophy is explicitly "pay-for-performance," where base salary represents a significantly smaller portion of the overall target compensation compared to variable (at-risk) incentives.
2.  **Short-Term Incentives (STI) / Annual Cash Bonus:** The annual incentive plan is tied to key annual financial metrics, such as **Adjusted EBITDA**, **Adjusted Operating Cash Flow**, and **Revenue**. The achievement of these targets directly determines the annual cash bonus payout.
3.  **Long-Term Incentives (LTI) - PSUs and RSUs:** A significant portion of target total compensation is delivered through long-term equity awards, primarily **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)** (60% of target LTI) that vest over three years, which promotes sustained long-term value creation.
4.  **Shareholder-Aligned LTI Metrics:** The PSUs are based on equally weighted, multi-year performance measures, including internal financial targets (**Cumulative Adjusted EBITDA** and **Cumulative Adjusted Operating Cash Flow**) and an external, market-based metric: **Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)** compared to a peer group.
5.  **Direct Payout Link to Performance:** The three-year PSU cycle for fiscal 2023-2025 yielded a payout of 134.2% of target, largely due to strong performance in rTSR (achieving the 66.7th percentile) and adjusted operating cash flow, demonstrating a direct correlation between company and relative market performance and executive pay.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

1.  **Strong Incentive for Shareholder Interest:** The compensation structure is overwhelmingly weighted toward variable, at-risk pay with a significant focus on long-term equity awards (PSUs).
2.  **Balanced Performance Goals:** The use of both internal financial metrics (EBITDA, Cash Flow) and the external, market-based **Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)** for the largest component of long-term pay ensures that management cannot simply boost short-term earnings but must outperform its peer group over a multi-year period to realize its highest compensation.
3.  **Managerial Self-Interest Aligned with Shareholders:** The extremely high stock ownership guidelines (7x salary for CEO) and the retention requirement mean that executives can only significantly "line their own pockets" by successfully increasing and sustaining the value of SAIC's stock over the long term, directly benefiting shareholders.
4.  **Shareholder Approval:** Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the executive compensation ("Say-on-Pay") in 2025, which further supports the conclusion that the existing incentive structure is perceived by investors as fair and aligned with their interests.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of its recent price history and technical indicators, here is an overview of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) stock:

1.  **Current Position Relative to 52-Week Range:**
    *   The stock is currently trading around \$98.26 (as of February 9, 2026), which is significantly below its 52-week high of \$124.11, but notably above its 52-week low of \$84.12.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:**
    *   SAIC's current stock price is approximately **16.8%** above its 52-week low of \$84.12.

3.  **Technical Analysis and Trading Status:**
    *   The stock is showing mixed-to-negative signals based on various technical analysis indicators; for instance, many long-term Moving Averages (MA50 to MA200) suggest a **"Sell"** outlook.
    *   However, short-term oscillators, such as the Ultimate Oscillator, often show a **"Buy"** signal, while the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is typically in the **"Neutral"** range (around 47.79).
    *   While not currently at its lowest point, the overall technical analysis often leans negative, and one analysis gives the stock a very poor technical rating of 1 out of 10, suggesting it is lagging the S\&P 500 Index.

4.  **Major Price Drops in the Last Few Months:**
    *   The stock experienced a sharp drop of over 12% in early September 2025 following the announcement of a **major share sale**, which raised investor concerns about the company's financial strategy.
    *   A further drop of about 7% occurred shortly after the Q2 2026 earnings report, primarily because the company's **revenue missed analyst expectations**, and management lowered its full fiscal year 2026 guidance.
    *   The lowered guidance was attributed to slower conversion of on-contract growth opportunities and delays in new business awards.

5.  **Interesting Valuation Insight:**
    *   Despite the technical warnings and revenue misses, some valuation models suggest the stock is **currently undervalued**, and the company has a 13-year track record of consistent dividend payments.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for SAIC relies on its status as an indispensable, trusted technology integrator for the stable, high-budget U.S. government market. The company benefits from a massive, multi-year backlog of over $20 billion, providing reliable, recurring revenue. In the near term, the stock will be supported by management’s intense focus on cost cutting and efficiency gains, which should quickly boost profit margins (EBITDA). Furthermore, the company’s strategic plan to use excess cash flow for aggressive share repurchases will immediately increase earnings per share. Long-term growth is secured by the non-negotiable, decades-long requirement for the federal government to modernize its systems (Digital Transformation). SAIC is uniquely positioned to integrate crucial commercial technologies—like Cloud, advanced Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence—into mission-critical defense and intelligence operations, ensuring a continuous stream of profitable service contracts aligned with national security priorities.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that U.S. federal spending on defense and technology services remains stable or increases, avoiding major budget cuts or sequestration events. SAIC must successfully execute its recent organizational restructuring, delivering the promised cost efficiencies and margin expansion targets. The company must successfully defend and win large, multi-billion dollar contract recompetes to maintain or grow its substantial backlog. Management must successfully retain and recruit highly-cleared personnel, which is the company's key asset. Finally, the integration of recent acquisitions must yield the expected revenue and technological benefits across the wider customer base.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is robustly challenged by a combination of weak organic growth, competitive pricing pressure, and inherent operational risks specific to the government contracting sector.

### **Critique and Faults in the Bull Thesis**

1.  **Fault in "Reliable, Recurring Revenue" from Backlog:** While the $20+ billion backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility, recent financial results indicate that **top-line revenue growth is flat or in a state of organic decline** year-over-year. This suggests the company is struggling to convert its substantial backlog into accelerated revenue growth, which is a major red flag for a "growth" thesis.
2.  **Hole in "Quickly Boost Profit Margins (EBITDA)" via Cost Cuts:** The reliance on cost cutting and restructuring for margin expansion (EBITDA) is a short-term, finite lever. A sustained bull case requires *operating leverage* from increasing revenue, but SAIC's margins remain modest and must contend with a persistently **high cost base** and the perpetual threat of competitors undercutting prices to win contracts.
3.  **Fault in "Aggressive Share Repurchases" as a Growth Driver:** Aggressive share repurchases are a form of financial engineering that boosts Earnings Per Share (EPS) without increasing intrinsic business value. This strategy, while immediately beneficial to EPS, can be a sign that **management lacks confidence in achieving strong organic revenue growth**, and it consumes capital that could be used for higher-ROI investments or debt reduction.
4.  **Hole in "Uniquely Positioned" for Digital Transformation:** The high-end digital modernization (Cloud, AI, Cybersecurity) space is highly competitive, featuring larger, well-funded pure-play rivals like Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos. SAIC's "integrator" status may place it in a middle-ground where it must **compete on price against smaller, more specialized, and agile firms**, potentially eroding the profitability of its next-generation contracts.
5.  **Fault in "Stable, High-Budget U.S. Government Market":** The primary assumption of market stability is undermined by the continuous threat of **political gridlock, government shutdowns, and budget sequestration**. These events introduce significant uncertainty and can halt new contract awards or delay funding, impacting cash flow and growth predictability for all government contractors.
6.  **Hole in Contract Recompete Success:** The company's future revenue is contingent on successfully defending its large existing contracts (recompetes). Management has stated a goal to **return its recompete win rate to the 90% range**, suggesting recent performance has been below this critical threshold. Losing even one massive, multi-billion-dollar recompete could wipe out years of smaller new-business wins.

---

### **Bear Case Thesis for SAIC**

The bear case for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) centers on a narrative of **low-growth stagnation and margin pressure**, where financial engineering temporarily masks underlying operational challenges.

1.  **Stagnant Organic Growth and Financial Engineering Dependence:** SAIC is a mature, low-growth integrator with a high cost base, demonstrated by recent flat-to-declining organic revenue, despite a strong total backlog. The company is relying heavily on aggressive share repurchases to boost EPS, an unsustainable strategy that prioritizes short-term stock performance over long-term intrinsic business growth.
2.  **Competitive Margin Erosion:** The intense competition in the federal IT services market forces SAIC to bid lower on critical recompetes and new business to win, which will put continuous downward pressure on the sought-after margin expansion from cost-cutting efforts. The cost savings achieved through restructuring may be entirely offset by the need for more aggressive pricing to maintain its market share and protect its substantial backlog.
3.  **Talent War and Operational Risk:** The successful integration of "Cloud, advanced Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence" relies on retaining and recruiting highly-cleared, specialized personnel. SAIC faces a severe talent war against rivals who may offer more attractive employment propositions, risking the loss of the key asset required to deliver on its next-generation contracts and undermining its competitive positioning.
4.  **Federal Budget Volatility:** The company's revenue remains vulnerable to the constant political uncertainty in Washington, D.C., where the risk of continuing resolutions, government shutdowns, and sequestration poses an existential threat to the timing and size of government IT spending, making predictable growth impossible.

## Next Steps

This is a very comprehensive and well-structured analysis of SAIC, particularly strong on the management, moat, and historical context. The bull and bear cases are clearly articulated and hit on the right risks (low organic growth, recompete pressure, financial engineering).

The primary missing pieces are *specific, recent, comparative numbers* and a deeper dive into the immediate consequences of the management transition.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps you should take for a complete investment thesis:

### **1. Quantify Financial Health and Organic Growth**

1.  **Organic Revenue Growth Trajectory:** Get precise figures on SAIC's historical **organic revenue growth (or contraction) rate** for the last 4-8 quarters. This is the central point of the bear case, and confirming the specific number is critical to validating the long-term growth story. In Q1 FY2026, revenue growth was approximately 2%, and the full FY2026 guidance was for about 2.5% organic growth at the midpoint, with Q3 FY2026 showing a 5.6% contraction. This volatility needs deeper scrutiny.
2.  **Backlog Conversion and Book-to-Bill Rate:** Investigate the recent **backlog conversion rate** (how much is converting to revenue) and the **Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Book-to-Bill ratio**. While the backlog is large, a TTM book-to-bill ratio below 1.0 (it was 0.8 in Q1 FY2026, and 0.9 in Q4 FY2025/FY2025) suggests the backlog is declining, not growing. A book-to-bill of 1.2 in Q3 FY2026 is an improvement, but the long-term trend remains a key question.
3.  **Debt, Leverage, and Share Repurchase Capacity:** Determine the company’s current **Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio**. The balance sheet capacity is crucial because the bull case relies on debt-funded M&A (acquisitions) and share repurchases to drive EPS. A Debt/EBITDA ratio was 3.72 in the current year according to one analysis. You must assess if this leverage limits future acquisitions that are needed to offset organic weakness.

### **2. Competitive and Margin Analysis**

4.  **Peer-to-Peer Margin Comparison:** Perform a direct comparison of **Adjusted EBITDA Margins** and **Net Margins** against its primary peers: **Leidos (LDOS)** and **Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)**. SAIC's margin is around 9.5%. If competitors consistently have significantly higher margins (e.g., Leidos's net margin is 8.11% and BAH's is 7.35% compared to SAIC's 6.49% net margin as of the analysis), it validates the bear case's argument about SAIC's poor pricing power and structural cost disadvantage.
5.  **Specific Recompete Risk and Pricing Scrutiny:** Identify the **next 2-3 largest contract recompetes (renewals) SAIC is defending in the next 18-24 months** by name and value. The analysis notes the risk of losing a large recompete. Losing a contract could wipe out years of smaller new-business wins. Also, the bear case highlights pricing pressure, which is demonstrated by a protest that alleged SAIC's winning $95 million bid was unrealistically low. Look for management commentary on the total dollar value of contracts coming up for recompete.

### **3. Strategic and Forward Guidance Clarity**

6.  **Post-Restructuring and CEO Commentary:** Since the CEO change and reorganization occurred so recently (late 2025), you need to find **analyst and management commentary *after* the Q3 FY2026 earnings (December 2025)**. Search for details on how the new three-group structure is specifically expected to increase win rates and margins, and whether management has confirmed any *new* long-term financial targets. The Q2 FY2026 results (September 2025) had already lowered revenue guidance but raised EPS guidance, underscoring the shift to financial engineering over organic growth.
