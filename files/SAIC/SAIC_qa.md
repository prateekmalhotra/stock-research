## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) functions as a technology and service provider almost exclusively for the United States Federal Government. Their customers are domestic entities, primarily the Department of Defense, NASA, and U.S. intelligence agencies, meaning their business is concentrated in the government sector. SAIC makes money by winning large, long-term contracts to deliver specialized labor, such as systems engineering, cybersecurity, and IT modernization services, helping government agencies upgrade their computer networks and critical infrastructure. The core business model relies on maintaining highly specialized staff who are paid by the hour or by project completion, with the company's success dependent upon continually winning and executing these complex, custom-made government contracts.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant immediate risk stems from SAIC's reliance on a single customer: the U.S. Federal Government. Any political instability, such as federal budget delays, government shutdowns, or temporary funding measures (Continuing Resolutions), can instantly freeze new contract awards and delay payments, which negatively impacts earnings. Historically, these government shutdowns have occurred and serve as a constant near-term threat to cash flow. A major long-term risk involves intense competition within the defense and services sector. Losing a large, existing contract during the re-bidding process (known as 're-compete loss') to a rival company would cause an immediate and steep drop in future revenue. Furthermore, since SAIC’s service is specialized labor, the inability to hire and retain employees with high-level security clearances, especially amidst rising industry wages, creates a long-term risk of increased labor costs that could significantly squeeze profit margins on fixed-price contracts.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), presented in simple, jargon-free points.

### **The Founding: An Idea for Scientific Excellence (1969)**

1.  **Inception by a Frustrated Physicist:** Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster, a physicist who had grown frustrated with the bureaucratic nature of the large corporation where he previously worked.
2.  **The Founding Goal:** His primary goal was to create a new kind of company focused on pure scientific research and technical advice for the U.S. government, specifically in areas like nuclear power and weapons effects studies.
3.  **A Unique Culture from Day One:** Dr. Beyster started the company with the revolutionary idea that it should be **employee-owned**, believing that giving employees a share of the company would attract the best minds and foster deep innovation and loyalty.

### **The Early Years and Business Growth (1970s–2000s)**

4.  **Steady Diversification:** Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, SAIC steadily grew its focus beyond just defense, expanding into critical areas like national security, energy, and environmental services.
5.  **A Key Business Tailwind:** A major advantage, or **tailwind**, was the consistently high and stable spending of the U.S. government across its defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies, creating a perpetual market for SAIC’s high-tech consulting and engineering services.
6.  **The IPO Milestone:** In 2006, the original company underwent an Initial Public Offering (IPO), transitioning from a private, employee-owned firm to a publicly traded corporation, which generated significant capital and provided wealth to long-time employee shareholders.

### **The Defining Problem and Innovative Solution: The Great Split (2013)**

7.  **The Core Problem (Headwind): Conflict of Interest:** As the company grew, it faced a major regulatory obstacle known as a "conflict of interest" under federal acquisition rules. This rule often prevented the same company from advising the government on *what* technology to buy and then *selling* that technology or service.
8.  **The Bold Solution: Splitting the Company:** In 2013, the company executed a major strategic move to overcome this problem by splitting into two separate, independent, publicly traded companies.
9.  **The New SAIC is Born:** The original parent company changed its name to **Leidos**, while the spin-off, which specialized in providing direct support, government services, and information technology, retained the name **Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)**. This division allowed both new companies to bid on a much wider range of government contracts, turning a problem into a massive growth opportunity.

### **SAIC Today: A Mission Integrator (Present)**

10. **Modern Goal: Digital Transformation:** The modern SAIC's core goal is to be a premier **mission integrator**, meaning they take emerging technologies like cloud computing, cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and securely integrate them into the U.S. government's existing, complex systems.
11. **Strategy: Growth by Acquisition:** The company's successful strategy has relied heavily on targeted acquisitions, such as acquiring Engility Holdings and Unisys US Federal in the late 2010s. This rapidly boosted its size and expertise in key areas like logistics, engineering, and government IT modernization.
12. **Dealing with Headwinds: Financial Shift:** A continuous challenge (or **headwind**) in the government sector is the volatility and delay in awarding new contracts. To deal with this, SAIC has been shifting its pricing strategy from "cost-plus" (where the government pays costs plus a fee) to "fixed-price" contracts, which allow SAIC to manage costs more efficiently and increase its profit margins.
13. **Current Focus and Scale:** Today, SAIC is a Fortune 500 company, with the vast majority of its multi-billion dollar revenue coming from long-term contracts with the U.S. government's defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is primarily built upon a combination of **Intangible Assets** (deep government relationships and security clearances) and extremely high **Switching Costs** inherent to the mission-critical nature of their work.

Here is an analysis of SAIC's competitive position:

### The Core Moat of SAIC

1.  **High Switching Costs and Contract Stickiness:** SAIC’s contracts are typically long-term, multi-year, and massive in scale, creating a large, stable revenue backlog (around $22.3 billion). Once the company integrates its solutions into a government agency's mission-critical systems (e.g., military networks or weapon platforms), replacing the vendor becomes prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and risky for the government client.
2.  **Intangible Assets: Access and Clearances:** The company’s entire business is a product of decades-long trust with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community. This includes maintaining the necessary high-level security clearances and having direct access to exclusive government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs) and contract vehicles (like OASIS or SEWP V) required for bidding, which are impossible for new competitors to replicate quickly.
3.  **Recurring and Sticky Customer Contracts:** The contracts are highly recurring, not one-time transactions. SAIC focuses on "on-contract growth," meaning they expand the scope of existing contracts and win "recompetes" (renewal of existing work) by continually integrating new technologies. The work often involves sustaining and modernizing existing, complex government infrastructure.

### Differentiation and Pricing Power

4.  **Special Position as a "Mission Integrator":** SAIC's primary differentiation is its ability to act as a **premier technology integrator**, combining commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, its own developed tools, and partner solutions into secure, mission-specific systems for the government. They bridge the gap between rapidly evolving commercial technology (like cloud and AI) and the stringent security and compliance requirements of a government customer.
5.  **Differentiated Product Access (AI/Digital):** SAIC has developed specific AI solutions, like the DAX offering, that have achieved "Awardable" status on accelerated DoD acquisition marketplaces (like Tradewinds). This allows the government to quickly adopt SAIC’s innovative technologies, offering a tangible, differentiated edge over competitors who may not have this rapid, pre-vetted access.
6.  **Pricing Power via Fixed-Price Contracts:** The company is strategically shifting its mix from traditional, low-margin "cost-plus" contracts to **fixed-price contracts**. On fixed-price deals, SAIC takes on more risk but can capture greater profit (adjusted EBITDA margins over 12%) by delivering the work more efficiently than planned, demonstrating a level of pricing power derived from superior execution and internal cost control.

### Historical Growth and Displacement Risk

7.  **Reason for Growth (Strategic Split):** SAIC grew into what it is today partly because of a major strategic decision in 2013 to split into two separate companies (SAIC and Leidos). This separation was specifically mandated to resolve **Conflicts of Interest** in government contracting, which instantly allowed the new SAIC to successfully bid on major contracts it was previously blocked from pursuing. Subsequent large acquisitions (e.g., Engility for $2.5 billion) have been key to scaling its capabilities and customer base.
8.  **Displacement is Difficult (Capital is Not Enough):** An outsider with vast capital cannot easily displace SAIC. The barrier to entry is not merely capital, but rather the regulatory hurdles, the necessity of having thousands of employees with high-level security clearances, and the long, proven track record required to secure the multi-billion-dollar contract vehicles that SAIC holds.
9.  **Network Effects (Indirect):** True network effects (where the product is more valuable as more people use it) are limited. However, SAIC benefits from a pseudo-network effect in its operating model: as a premier government integrator, its investments through **SAIC Ventures** into commercial dual-use technology startups ensure that cutting-edge commercial innovation is rapidly introduced and validated within the government's highly secure ecosystem, making SAIC the preferred channel for new technology.

### Investment in R&D and Innovation

10. **Necessity to Constantly Innovate:** SAIC must constantly innovate to maintain its edge, as its value proposition is integrating the *latest* technology. The company is strategically focused on aligning its internal R&D (research and development) and innovation spending directly to customer opportunities they plan to bid on in the near future (24 months).
11. **R&D Strategy:** Rather than competing with tech giants on fundamental research, SAIC focuses on being a smart, strategic buyer of external innovation through its venture arm and then rapidly adapting those technologies for government use. This approach minimizes internal R&D risk while maintaining a technological lead in mission applications.

## Management Record

**Management Analysis of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for Investors**

**A. History and Track Record of Previous Management**

1.  **Founding Management:** SAIC was founded in 1969 by Dr. John Robert Beyster, who served as CEO until 2004, establishing the company's decades-long history as a major government contractor.
2.  **Post-Split CEO (Tony Moraco):** Tony Moraco, CEO from 2013 to 2019, led the company's separation into two independent, publicly traded companies: SAIC and Leidos, refocusing SAIC as a $4 billion entity. Under his seven-year tenure, the company’s revenue grew to $6.5 billion through strategic acquisitions like Scitor and Engility, and the stock price more than doubled, delivering significant shareholder value.
3.  **Recent Past CEO (Nazzic Keene):** Nazzic Keene, CEO from 2019 to October 2023, continued the M&A strategy by acquiring Unisys Federal in 2020 and focused the portfolio on "Growth and Technology Accelerants" (GTAs). Management under Keene reported two consecutive years of organic growth and a 30% Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in fiscal year 2023.

**B. Recent CEO Transition and Current Management**

4.  **Toni Townes-Whitley (2023-2025):** Townes-Whitley, who took over in October 2023, was selected to build on momentum and accelerate organic growth but departed abruptly in October 2025. Her departure followed the company's lowered fiscal 2026 revenue guidance, indicating a struggle to sustain growth momentum and execute on promises despite strong contract-winning abilities.
5.  **Interim CEO (Jim Reagan):** The Board appointed board member and former Leidos CFO Jim Reagan as Interim CEO while a search for a permanent leader is underway. The immediate priority of the new interim management is driving efficiency and improving margins to increase investments for growth.
6.  **Key Strategic Decision (Reorganization):** In November 2025, the new management announced a second major reorganization, consolidating five business groups into three to optimize operations and accelerate growth. This aggressive move, which included the departure of several senior executives, is a clear signal of the board's decisive action to address the recent growth struggles.

**C. Future Strategy and Value Delivery**

7.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** The core strategy is to focus on **Growth and Technology Accelerants (GTAs)**, including secure cloud, enterprise IT, and all-domain C5ISR/operations, while protecting the core government contracting business. This strategy is intended to align with customer needs and generate sustainable organic growth and long-term shareholder value creation.
8.  **Commitment to Shareholders:** Management maintains a consistent track record of disciplined capital deployment, with a focus on share repurchases and quarterly dividends. In fiscal year 2023, $353 million was deployed, with the majority allocated to share repurchases and dividends.
9.  **Performance Promise Delivery:** While past management (Moraco, Keene) delivered growth and positive TSR, the recent CEO turnover and lowered guidance suggest the current leadership change is a direct response to a failure in delivering sustained organic growth on the most immediate promises.

**D. Board and Executive Composition**

10. **Board Diversity:** The company emphasizes accountability in leadership diversity, noting that 62% of its board of directors are women and people of color.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of the available compensation and incentive structure (primarily from recent proxy statements, DEF 14A), here is an analysis of Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) management incentives.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

1.  **Insider Ownership Percentage (Low Direct Ownership):**
    *   The CEO's direct ownership is reported as very low, at approximately 0.059% of the company's shares.
    *   *Conclusion on Ownership:* While a higher percentage is generally preferable for shareholder alignment, the company's robust stock ownership guidelines mitigate the concern over the low current direct stake.

2.  **Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines (Strong Alignment Mechanism):**
    *   SAIC maintains a strong stock ownership policy requiring executives to hold shares equivalent to a multiple of their base salary (e.g., **5x for the CEO** and **3x for other Named Executive Officers**).
    *   The company also imposes a **stock holding requirement** mandating that executive officers hold **100% of the net shares acquired** under equity programs until their target ownership multiple is met, which enforces a long-term interest.

3.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus (Shareholder-Aligned):**
    *   A substantial portion of executive compensation is granted through long-term equity, specifically **Performance Stock Units (PSUs)** and **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**, typically with a three-year vesting or performance period.
    *   Performance metrics for the PSUs include **Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)**, which directly ties a portion of the payout to how well SAIC's stock performs compared to its industry peer group, creating a direct link to shareholder value creation.

4.  **Short-Term Incentive (STI) Structure (Performance-Based):**
    *   The annual cash incentive is tied to achieving specific, measurable financial metrics that drive operational success, such as **Adjusted EBITDA**, **Revenue**, and **Adjusted Operating Cash Flow**.
    *   These annual goals are designed to support the overall long-term strategy, ensuring executives focus on both near-term execution and long-term value.

5.  **Risk Mitigation and Anti-Pockets-Lining Safeguards:**
    *   SAIC strictly prohibits all executive officers and directors from engaging in certain activities that could decouple their financial interests from shareholders, including **short selling, hedging transactions, and pledging company stock**.
    *   This policy is a key indicator that the incentive structure is designed to promote sustained stock price growth over opportunistic short-term gains or personal risk mitigation.

### Conclusion on Management Incentive

The management of SAIC is structurally **well-incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The compensation system is strongly oriented towards a **"pay-for-performance" philosophy**, with a heavy emphasis on **long-term equity (PSUs/RSUs)** over base salary.
*   The inclusion of **Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)** as a performance metric for PSUs ensures that compensation is tied to shareholder returns relative to the market, and the **5x/3x stock ownership requirements with the 100% holding requirement** force executives to maintain a significant, long-term personal investment in the company's stock price success.
*   The prohibitions against hedging and pledging act as a key safeguard to ensure executives cannot protect their compensation value from a decline in stock price, aligning their personal risk with that of the shareholders.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of its recent price history and technical indicators, here is a summary for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC):

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Low:** The closing stock price for SAIC was approximately **\$108.74** as of January 21, 2026, with a 52-week low of **\$84.16** (or similar, like \$84.12 or \$84.51).
2.  **Percent Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **29.2%** above its 52-week low of \$84.16.
3.  **Technical Analysis Status:** The technical outlook is mixed but leans positive, indicating the stock is **not trading at a clear low**; it is currently in a short-term rising trend. While some short-term moving averages show a "Sell" or "Neutral" signal, many key moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA100, MA200) indicate a "Buy" signal, and the overall summary from some technical ratings services is a "Strong Buy."
4.  **Major Price Drop (Mid-2025):** SAIC shares experienced a significant drop, including a ~9% fall in early June 2025, after the company reported fiscal Q1 2026 adjusted profit and free cash flow that were lower than analysts' expectations.
5.  **Stock Was "Up Bigly" (Late 2025):** Following the prior drop that pushed the stock near its 52-week low, the stock saw a large single-day gain of **+16.29%** on December 4, 2025.
6.  **Reason for the "Bigly" Gain:** This sharp rise was driven by the release of its fiscal Q3 results, which **beat expectations** for earnings per share (EPS) and EBITDA, and included modestly raised full-year guidance.
7.  **Recent Positive Momentum:** Following the earnings beat, the stock continued its upward momentum, rising approximately **9.79%** over the two weeks leading up to January 16, 2026.

## Long Thesis

SAIC is an essential, highly stable technology partner to the U.S. Federal Government, focusing exclusively on defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies. The company benefits from extremely high barriers to entry due to its deep trust, specialized security clearances, and multi-year, sticky contracts, which results in a massive $22 billion revenue backlog. Near-term growth will be accelerated by aggressive new management actions aimed at cutting over $100 million in costs and restructuring the company to immediately boost profitability and operating margins. Long term, SAIC is uniquely positioned as the premier 'Mission Integrator,' capturing persistent government spending on high-priority modern technologies like cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity. By consistently winning large, profitable fixed-price deals and returning value through share repurchases, SAIC is set for sustainable, long-term earnings growth.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The U.S. government must maintain or increase its spending on defense and IT modernization, avoiding disruptive budget shutdowns. New management must successfully execute their cost-saving initiatives and translate those savings into higher profit margins. SAIC must continue to successfully win key expiring contracts against major competitors. Finally, the company must be able to hire and retain the thousands of highly specialized employees with necessary security clearances required to fulfill its complex service contracts.

## Bear Case Scenario

This bear case critique identifies the primary flaws and risks in the provided long thesis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), using recent financial and market context.

## Critique and Bear Case Thesis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)

### I. Flaws in the Financial Stability and Growth Narrative

1.  **Backlog Conversion and Organic Growth Challenge:** While the $\$22$ billion backlog is large, it does not guarantee revenue growth; SAIC's latest reported book-to-bill ratio was below 1.0, meaning they are drawing down on the backlog faster than replenishing it with new wins, signaling a shrinking future revenue base. Furthermore, management has lowered its revenue guidance for future fiscal years, projecting an organic revenue decline in the near term, which directly contradicts the expectation of "accelerated growth."
2.  **Cost-Cutting is Defensive, Not Purely an Accelerator:** The management's $\$100$ million+ cost-saving plan appears primarily defensive, intended to "mitigate the impact on EBITDA and free cash flow from lower revenue," rather than to simply boost profitability from a foundation of strong top-line growth. This indicates the company is reacting to current revenue headwinds and operational inefficiencies, which introduces execution risk to the promised margin expansion.
3.  **Pressure on Operating Margins:** The thesis assumes that management actions will "immediately boost profitability and operating margins," but the company's adjusted EBITDA margin guidance has been subject to slight downward revisions, and analysts are modeling for profit margins to potentially ease in the long term. Moreover, an unexpected 3% headwind on a major contract like Cloud 1 Compute and Store revenue demonstrates that margins are susceptible to government scope changes.

### II. Flaws in the Competitive and Market Positioning Claims

1.  **"Uniquely Positioned" is an Overstatement in a Crowded Field:** The claim of being the "premier 'Mission Integrator'" in high-priority technologies (Cloud, AI, Cybersecurity) is a strategic marketing position, not a unique advantage. Competitors like Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI, and Parsons are all aggressively pursuing and winning major contracts in the identical mission and enterprise IT modernization spaces, intensifying price and talent competition.
2.  **Risk in Fixed-Price Contracts in a Volatile Market:** The focus on "large, profitable fixed-price deals" carries significant risk. As a "Mission Integrator" deploying complex, rapidly evolving technologies like AI and Digital Engineering, SAIC assumes all the risk of potential cost overruns, technical scope creep, and schedule delays, which can severely compress margins if not flawlessly executed.
3.  **Talent Acquisition is a Cross-Industry Problem:** The thesis assumes SAIC can "hire and retain the thousands of highly specialized employees." However, the tight labor market for cleared IT professionals is an industry-wide constraint. Failure to compete on compensation or to manage talent effectively could lead to higher labor costs and staffing shortages, directly impacting the ability to fulfill sticky contracts and execute on-contract growth.

### III. Flaws in the Government Spending and Contract Cycle Assumptions

1.  **Procurement Instability and Budget Volatility are Realized Risks:** The core assumption that the U.S. government will avoid disruptive shutdowns and maintain stable spending is already being challenged. Agencies have been "slower to obligate funds against active contracts," and award delays are an "unstable" fact of life, causing revenue softness. This procurement slowdown is a major headwind not fully accounted for in the bullish "highly stable" revenue premise.
2.  **Government Acquisition Workforce Turnover Impedes SAIC's Business:** High turnover of **government acquisition personnel** is slowing down program funding and prolonging decision cycles for contract awards, delaying when SAIC can book and begin work on new programs, which directly hampers the ability to replace the backlog.

***

## Bear Case Thesis

SAIC is a defense contractor facing cyclical top-line pressure that is being masked by one-time cost-cutting measures and a shifting industry narrative. The company is actively consuming its large, valuable contract backlog faster than it can replenish it (Book-to-Bill below 1.0), which points toward future revenue contraction. The new management's aggressive cost-cutting plan is a *defensive maneuver* to protect operating margins from a shrinking revenue base, not a growth accelerator. Furthermore, the company's position as a "Mission Integrator" is not unique and faces intense competition from larger, more profitable rivals who are also capitalizing on the same high-growth AI and Cyber markets. Until SAIC can demonstrate a sustained book-to-bill ratio significantly above 1.0 and translate its cost savings into **organic growth** (not just preserved margins), the stock will trade at a discount due to top-line uncertainty, execution risk on fixed-price contracts, and vulnerability to the perpetually unstable federal budget and procurement cycles.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis is thorough, successfully identifying the core conflict: the long-term potential (moat, catalysts) versus the immediate revenue headwinds and management instability (Bear Case).

The first round of search results provides critical, updated financial and management information that directly addresses some of your previous open questions and *changes* the bear case narrative.

### Summary of New Information:

*   **Book-to-Bill is Not Below 1.0 (The Bullish Rebuttal):** The Bear Case assumed a Book-to-Bill below 1.0, but the Q3 FY2026 results show a trailing twelve months Book-to-Bill of **1.2** and a year-to-date Book-to-Bill of **1.3**. This indicates the backlog is currently being *replenished* faster than it is being consumed, which directly refutes a key part of the Bear Case.
*   **Organic Growth Still a Headwind:** FY2026 organic revenue growth is still guided to be negative at **(2% - 3%)**, confirming the near-term revenue pressure.
*   **Management/Execution Action is Clear:** The CEO transition to Jim Reagan is complete, and the reorganization from five to three business groups is set to take effect on January 31, 2026, with several executive departures. The interim CEO's priority is to use the **$100 million+ cost savings** to fund growth and improve margins.
*   **Valuation is "Value-Oriented":** Peer analysis suggests SAIC trades at a lower Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio (**14.21**) compared to its closest competitor, Leidos (**18.18**), supporting the idea of a "valuation kicker" for investors who want federal IT exposure without paying top multiples.

---

## Next Steps: Important Unanswered Questions to Investigate

Based on the existing analysis and the new information, the focus must shift to quantifying the competitive gap and the execution risk of the new management team.

1.  **Quantify Competitive Landscape (Organic Growth & Margins)**
    *   **Question:** How does SAIC's target/reaffirmed FY2027 organic growth guidance of **0–3%** and its current adjusted EBITDA margin of **9.9%** truly compare to its direct competitors (Leidos, Booz Allen, CACI)?
    *   *Goal:* Determine if the valuation discount is justified by a structural inferiority in growth and profitability or if it's a temporary dislocation. SAIC's P/E is lower than Leidos, but a quantitative comparison of key multiples (e.g., EV/EBITDA) and margins for all peers is missing.

2.  **Evaluate Fixed-Price Contract Mix (Execution Risk vs. Margin Upside)**
    *   **Question:** What is SAIC's **current percentage** of revenue derived from fixed-price contracts, and what is the **management's multi-year target** for this mix?
    *   *Goal:* The switch to fixed-price is a critical part of the long thesis (margin expansion) and the bear case (execution risk). We need the exact numbers to track the company's progress and potential exposure to cost overruns.

3.  **Trace Specific Competitor Wins/Losses (Competitive Intensity)**
    *   **Question:** The analysis mentions intense competition. Can a recent, major **re-compete loss** to a specific rival (e.g., a recompete lost to Leidos or CACI in the last 12-18 months) be identified?
    *   *Goal:* Losing a large, existing contract is the "deadly" risk mentioned in the analysis. Finding a definitive recent loss would validate the competitive pressure better than anecdotal evidence.

4.  **Analyze Interim CEO's Vision and Succession Status**
    *   **Question:** Has the Board provided a definitive timeline or any details regarding the **search for the permanent CEO**? What is the market's perception of Interim CEO Jim Reagan's plan to *reprogram* the cost savings—is it viewed as enough to reignite growth?
    *   *Goal:* A long, drawn-out interim period is a major governance risk. The market needs clarity on the long-term leader and their commitment to the new reorganization.
