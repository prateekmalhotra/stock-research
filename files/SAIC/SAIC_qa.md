## Business Summary

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) operates primarily as a specialized technology and engineering services provider whose main customer is the United States Federal Government, particularly the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Geographically, almost all of their business is concentrated within the U.S. SAIC does not typically sell physical goods; instead, its core model is to secure complex, often multi-year contracts through competitive bidding to help government clients modernize their old IT systems, manage complex defense networks, and provide expert staff for missions like cybersecurity and cloud migration. Revenue is heavily dependent on winning these large service contracts, making the company an integrator of technology and a seller of highly skilled labor and expertise.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk stems from the highly concentrated customer base: delays or reductions in the U.S. federal budget. Since nearly all of SAIC's revenue comes from government contracts, any failure by Congress to pass spending bills on time (which frequently happens) or substantial cuts to defense spending immediately halts or slows contract work, directly harming earnings. Similar threats occurred in the early 2010s when mandatory budget cuts, known as sequestration, forced government agencies to delay or cancel programs, reducing SAIC's profitability. This remains a concern due to ongoing political budget disputes. A critical long-term risk is the intense competition for highly qualified technical talent, especially personnel holding necessary security clearances. If SAIC cannot recruit and retain top engineers and IT experts, they cannot fulfill their contractual obligations. Furthermore, as government contractors, they face severe regulatory and reputational risks; any security breach, ethical violation, or compliance failure could lead to being barred from bidding on future contracts entirely, which would be catastrophic for the business model.

## Company History

Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) began as a scientific think tank and has evolved into one of the U.S. government's largest technology and engineering service providers.

Here is a detailed history of the company:

### **Inception and Core Philosophy (1969 – 1990s)**

1.  **Founding and Goal:** Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by Dr. J. Robert Beyster, a nuclear physicist, in La Jolla, California. His goal was to create a company that provided sophisticated scientific research and technical advice to the U.S. government, particularly in areas like nuclear power and weapons effects.
2.  **The Employee-Ownership Innovation:** Dr. Beyster pioneered a unique business model by making the company employee-owned, widely distributing stock among staff. This culture was an innovative solution that attracted and retained top scientists and engineers, encouraging entrepreneurship and loyalty, which was rare for government contractors.
3.  **Early Growth and Diversification (Tailwind):** The company expanded rapidly throughout the Cold War era and its aftermath, acting as a tailwind. It diversified its portfolio beyond nuclear work into growing government needs like national security, defense systems, energy programs, and environmental services.

### **Major Challenges (Headwinds) and Solutions (2000s)**

4.  **Major Ethics Headwind (CityTime Scandal):** A significant setback occurred with the New York City CityTime payroll project, where the contract value ballooned from a projected \$63 million to over \$700 million due to fraud. This scandal involved kickbacks from a subcontractor to a few SAIC managers who fraudulently inflated costs and delayed the project over several years.
5.  **Dealing with the Scandal:** SAIC took responsibility for the criminal actions of its former employees, ultimately paying a \$500 million settlement to New York City and agreeing to institutional reforms to improve corporate ethics and compliance. This response was a crucial step in maintaining its ability to work with government clients, which is nearly all of its business.
6.  **The Conflict-of-Interest Problem (Headwind):** As the company grew, its vast size led to frequent "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (OCI) under government rules. These rules prevented SAIC from bidding on certain major contracts because its consulting work could give it an unfair advantage over competitors.

### **The Great Split and Rebirth (2013)**

7.  **The Strategic Solution (The Split):** To eliminate the OCI problem and unlock growth, the company underwent a major transformation in 2013, splitting into two separate, publicly traded companies.
8.  **The New SAIC's Goal:** The original parent company changed its name to Leidos, while the spin-off retained the name **Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)** and focused entirely on being a "mission integrator." The new SAIC's clear goal became providing direct technical support, high-end services, and technology integration to government organizations.

### **The Modern Company (Present Day)**

9.  **Current Business Model:** Today, SAIC is a Fortune 500 company that serves as a premier technology integrator for nearly all U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and various civilian groups. It secures massive, long-term contracts by translating complex national security and public service needs into secure digital solutions.
10. **Innovative Solutions through Acquisitions:** SAIC uses a strategic acquisition approach to stay competitive, a key innovative solution. For example, it acquired companies like Engility and Unisys Federal to quickly build capabilities in high-demand areas like cloud computing, modernizing outdated IT systems, and advanced engineering.
11. **Focus on Next-Gen Technology:** The company focuses its investment and acquisitions on **Growth and Technology Accelerants (GTA)**, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), secure cloud solutions, and digital engineering. This strategy drives higher-value work and is crucial for winning large, complex government contracts in the future.
12. **Current Headwinds:** Current market challenges include intense pressure from competitors on large contract renewals and persistent volatility in government funding. Delays in government-spending decisions, known as elongated procurement cycles, also affect their near-term revenue.
13. **Tailwinds and Future Outlook:** Key tailwinds are the stable demand for defense and intelligence spending and the ongoing, mandated need for federal agencies to modernize their aging information technology. SAIC capitalizes on this by offering "full life cycle services," managing everything from initial design to long-term operations and security for government missions.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is built less on proprietary technology and more on **deep integration, technical expertise, and an entrenched position as a trusted, large-scale partner** within the highly restricted U.S. government contracting market.

### Moat and Differentiation

1.  **High Switching Costs and Deep Integration:** SAIC's core moat is derived from the high technical and operational cost for a government agency to switch providers. The company manages complex, mission-critical, end-to-end IT infrastructure, systems, and engineering projects for the DoD and other agencies, creating a strong form of "vendor lock-in" because the cost and disruption of migrating to a new provider would be immense.
2.  **Entrenched Customer Relationships:** The company has a long-standing history and decades-long legacy of wins with key customers, including the Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community, and civilian agencies like NASA. This provides an in-depth understanding of the customers' unique missions, which is a significant competitive advantage over newer firms.
3.  **"Trusted Brand" Status:** The SAIC name, though confusingly shared with its spin-off Leidos, is a familiar and trusted brand among government buyers. This reputation acts as a soft barrier to entry, as new, unproven competitors struggle to gain access to the large, complex contracts that SAIC regularly wins.
4.  **Full Life Cycle Offerings:** SAIC differentiates itself by offering seamless, "full life cycle offerings," integrating technology and services from the initial requirements definition to development, integration, and long-term sustainment. This ability to deliver a broad range of integrated solutions makes it a one-stop-shop for complex government projects.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Limited Pricing Power:** SAIC operates in a very competitive market for government services, which limits its ability to demand premium pricing like a monopoly would. Government contracts are often awarded through highly competitive bidding processes, frequently utilizing pre-negotiated price schedules like GSA Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) contracts.
2.  **Shifting for Efficiency:** To improve its profit margins, SAIC has actively worked to shift some of its contracts from the traditional "cost-plus" model (where the government pays all costs plus a set fee) to **fixed-price deals**. This does not show pricing power over the customer, but rather a focus on efficiency to retain more profit by controlling its own costs.
3.  **Differentiation via High-End Services:** SAIC's special position is in providing "higher-end, differentiated technology services and solutions" like secure cloud modernization, digital engineering, and AI integration for mission-critical tasks. Its pricing power comes from the *specialized nature* of this work, making it one of the few qualified bidders, rather than its ability to raise prices arbitrarily.

### Growth and Displacement

1.  **Reason for Historic Growth (Foundational Advantage):** The company grew into what it is today by successfully winning early, "bigger-than-normal" large-scale, complex contracts and capitalizing on the broader political-economic shift where the government increasingly outsourced its service requirements to private contractors.
2.  **Sticky and Recurring Contracts:** The business is highly "sticky" and recurring, not transactional. Contracts are typically multi-year and focus on the sustainment, operation, and modernization of existing, essential systems, which inherently requires the services to be long-term and renewable.
3.  **Difficulty of Displacement:** It is difficult for someone with more capital to easily displace SAIC because the barriers are not just financial, but **regulatory and experiential**. Any new competitor needs security clearances, established processes, deep trust, and years of past performance to bid on the largest contracts, which capital alone cannot buy.
4.  **Innovation is Mandatory:** SAIC must constantly innovate and invest in internal research and development (R&D) to maintain its edge. The company runs an internal **Innovation Factory R&D** program to explore cutting-edge technologies. Since they provide *technology* and *IT* services, they must keep pace with rapid advancements in areas like AI, cloud, and cybersecurity to remain a relevant and competitive choice for the government.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)'s management incentive and compensation is based on the company's recent Definitive Proxy Statements (DEF 14A).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (SAIC)**

#### **1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **Low Direct Ownership:** The aggregate beneficial ownership of SAIC's common stock by all directors and executive officers as a group is very low, reported at approximately **0.44%**.
*   **Conclusion on Ownership:** A direct ownership percentage under 1% is generally considered a low level of "skin in the game" for a management group, which would typically suggest a weaker alignment with shareholders' interests based on direct holdings alone.
*   **Mandatory Ownership Guidelines:** The company mitigates this low direct ownership through **significant stock ownership requirements** for the Board and executives, which are designed to promote alignment with long-term stockholder interests.

#### **2. Executive Compensation Structure**

*   **Pay-Mix Philosophy:** The compensation philosophy adheres to a "pay-for-performance" model, where **base salary represents a significantly smaller portion** of overall compensation than variable, at-risk compensation.
*   **Focus on Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The majority of the targeted total direct compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is **equity-based**, which vests over multiple years and is explicitly tied to long-term value creation for shareholders.
*   **Annual Incentive Plan (AIP):** The short-term cash incentive plan encourages a balance between short-term financial, operational, and qualitative objectives, which are reviewed annually for their connection to the overall growth strategy.

#### **3. Performance Metrics for Alignment**

*   **Long-Term Incentive Metrics (LTI):** Performance-based stock awards, which are the main incentive component, are based on shareholder-centric metrics measured over a **three-year period**:
    *   **Three-Year Cumulative Operating Cash Flows**.
    *   **Three-Year Cumulative Earnings (Net Income or similar measure)**.
    *   **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** compared to a specified peer group.
*   **Shareholder Support:** The executive compensation program received broad shareholder agreement, with the 2024 "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote passing with approximately **97% of votes cast in favor**.

### **Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

The evidence suggests that SAIC's management is **sufficiently incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders, despite low overall beneficial ownership.**

*   **Incentivized for Shareholder Interest:** The compensation structure is overwhelmingly weighted toward **long-term, performance-based equity** (LTI) tied to metrics like cumulative cash flow, earnings, and **Relative TSR**. These metrics directly link executive wealth creation to the sustained financial performance and stock market returns experienced by shareholders over a multi-year horizon.
*   **Not Primarily to Line Their Own Pockets:** Since the majority of executive pay is **at-risk** and only earned if long-term financial and market-based performance goals are met, the program is designed to prevent managers from "lining their own pockets" purely on short-term gains or high base salaries.
*   **Key Mitigating Factor:** The mandatory stock ownership guidelines and the heavy reliance on LTI are the primary mechanisms aligning management with shareholders, overcoming the weak signal from the low direct beneficial ownership percentage.

## Price History

Based on recent market data and technical analysis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC):

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** SAIC's stock is currently trading approximately **21.25%** above its 52-week low.
    *   Using a recent closing price of \$102.00 and the 52-week low of \$84.12, the stock has made a substantial recovery from its yearly bottom.

2.  **Current Technical Analysis (Trading Low?):** The stock is not technically trading "low" on a short-term basis but is lagging the overall market and remains below its long-term average.
    *   The short-term trend is generally **positive**, with the stock price trading above its 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages, generating short-term "Buy" signals.
    *   However, the stock is still trading **below its 200-day simple moving average** (around \$106.81), which suggests the longer-term trend remains neutral or bearish.
    *   The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the neutral zone, and while the stock is significantly off its 52-week high of \$124.11, it is trading near the high of its last monthly range.

3.  **Big Drop Explanation (Late 2025):** A significant stock drop, which contributed to the stock nearing its 52-week low, occurred in late October/early November.
    *   This decline was primarily triggered by the announcement of a **CEO transition**, with the departure of Toni Townes-Whitley and the appointment of James Reagan as interim CEO.
    *   The stock was also noted as being in oversold territory following this decline, with analysts considering it undervalued compared to its fair value.

4.  **Recent Gains ("Up Bigly") Explanation:** The stock has seen a strong recovery and notable gains in the few months following the drop, including one large single-day gain of over 16%.
    *   This upward momentum is attributed to a positive combination of an earnings beat, strong guidance, and key contract wins.
    *   Specific positive catalysts included a **$242 million U.S. Navy contract award** and the announcement of a strong pipeline of new business, signaling a strategic growth inflection.
    *   The company's third-quarter earnings report, which beat analyst expectations and provided robust fiscal year 2026 guidance, also boosted investor confidence.

## Long Thesis

SAIC is set up for consistent, reliable growth because it is a deeply embedded and trusted partner to the U.S. government, which is required to spend massive amounts of money modernizing its outdated defense and technology systems. In the near term, the company is securing huge new multi-year contracts, leading to a massive backlog of guaranteed future revenue. Management is also improving how efficiently they run existing programs, which is boosting profit margins and cash flow for shareholders. Long term, SAIC is focusing its investments on the essential, high-growth technology areas the government needs most, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and moving secure operations to the cloud. Because it is incredibly costly and complex for the government to switch providers once a system is installed, SAIC benefits from long-term, predictable revenue streams that secure its market position.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

For this scenario to play out, four main things must happen: 1) The U.S. Congress must continue to pass stable, high-level budgets for defense and technology spending without major budget cuts or government shutdowns. 2) SAIC must successfully recruit and retain a large workforce of highly specialized engineers and IT experts who hold necessary security clearances. 3) The company must continue to win new large-scale contracts against intense competition and successfully meet the ambitious profitability targets it has promised to investors. 4) The company must quickly find and install a strong, permanent CEO who can stabilize the recent leadership changes and successfully execute the long-term strategy.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and faults in the long thesis, which form the basis for a counter (bear) case.

## Critique of the Long Thesis & Identification of Flaws

| Flaw/Hole in Thesis | Thesis Element Being Challenged | Corroborating Evidence/Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Executive & Operational Instability** | *Assumption 4: Must quickly find and install a strong, permanent CEO to stabilize leadership.* | The company is currently operating under an interim CEO following the unexpected departure of the previous CEO. This was quickly followed by a major reorganization (5 business units consolidated to 3) and the departure of several senior executives (including the EVPs of the Army and Space/Intelligence business units and the Chief Innovation Officer). This is more than a transition; it is **active, high-level turmoil** that threatens strategic execution. |
| **2. Contradiction on Near-Term Growth** | *Bull Thesis: SAIC is set up for consistent, reliable growth... In the near term, the company is securing huge new multi-year contracts, leading to a massive backlog...* | Despite a large total backlog of over \$23 billion, recent financial results show an **organic revenue contraction** (5.6% decline in Q3 FY26) and a reduction in full-year revenue guidance, signaling a near-term expected organic decline of 2-3%. This indicates that the large backlog is not translating into top-line revenue growth right now. |
| **3. Recompete & Competition Risk** | *Bull Thesis: SAIC benefits from long-term, predictable revenue streams that secure its market position.* | The thesis oversimplifies the "stickiness" of contracts. SAIC recently **lost an incumbent, \$927 million Air Force contract** after a protest was denied. This demonstrates the company is vulnerable to intense competition and the risk of losing existing large, profitable programs, directly challenging the predictability of future revenue streams. |
| **4. Labor & Workforce Constraint** | *Assumption 2: SAIC must successfully recruit and retain a large workforce of highly specialized engineers and IT experts who hold necessary security clearances.* | SAIC is an IT services firm whose success is tied to billable labor. The former CEO explicitly acknowledged industry-wide "volatility" and a "fundamental reduction in the government personnel" that creates a **challenging environment for recruiting and retaining** a cleared workforce and leads to program delays. |
| **5. Government Funding Volatility** | *Assumption 1: The U.S. Congress must continue to pass stable, high-level budgets for defense and technology spending without major budget cuts or government shutdowns.* | Recent quarterly results were negatively impacted by a government shutdown (an estimated 1% revenue headwind). The company has stated that a prolonged shutdown could affect its financial results, illustrating that the *assumption of stable budgets is being actively challenged* by **political and appropriations risk**. |

---

## Bear Case Thesis for Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)

1.  **Top-Line Contraction Overrides Backlog Optimism:** SAIC's massive backlog of over \$23 billion is misleading, as the company is currently experiencing a decline in organic revenue growth, forcing management to lower full-year guidance. This revenue contraction suggests that contract awards are slower to ramp, older contracts are completing faster than new business is starting, or there are significant delays in customer funding obligations.
2.  **Executive Instability Creates Strategy Execution Risk:** The company's sudden CEO departure and the subsequent exit of multiple senior executives, coupled with a major business unit reorganization, create material operational and strategic risk. The search for a permanent leader and the instability at the top could distract from core business development, delay crucial program decisions, and strain customer relationships.
3.  **Intensifying Competition Erodes "Sticky" Revenue:** The government services market is highly competitive, and even "incumbent" contracts are not guaranteed, as evidenced by SAIC's recent loss of a major Air Force contract following a protest. The reliance on large contract recompetes exposes the company to episodic revenue volatility and the constant threat of larger, more aggressive competitors like Leidos, Booz Allen Hamilton, and others.
4.  **Labor Constraints and Government Delays Cap Growth:** SAIC's profitability is fundamentally dependent on its ability to hire and retain highly-paid, cleared technical talent in high-demand areas like AI and Cloud. Industry-wide competition for this talent, combined with slow-moving government acquisition personnel and political budget delays (e.g., government shutdowns), create an operational ceiling on revenue growth and inflate labor costs.
5.  **Margin Growth is Non-Sustainable and Debt is a Factor:** While the company touts improved margins and EPS, the leverage associated with high debt levels (a key concern for some investors) remains a risk. Any new CEO may be forced to make costly new investments to jumpstart organic growth, potentially reversing the recent efficiency-driven margin and cash flow gains.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your analysis and the new information gathered, the next steps should focus on quantifying the financial impact of the recent turmoil and management's response, especially regarding growth and debt.

Here are the most important next steps and unanswered questions:

### Next Steps to Investigate

1.  **CEO Search and Executive Stability (Crucial Bear Case Risk)**
    *   **Search Status:** Investigate the timeline or criteria the Board of Directors is using to select a permanent CEO. The current information only states a search is underway. The sooner the new leader is named, the faster the management instability risk dissipates.
    *   **C-Suite Exodus Impact:** Search for analyst commentary or company statements regarding the talent risk associated with the departures of the EVPs of the Army, Space/Intelligence BUs, and the Chief Innovation Officer following the reorganization. This instability is a major operational risk.

2.  **Quantify M&A Catalyst (SilverEdge Acquisition)**
    *   **Target Revenue/Synergies:** Now that you know SAIC is acquiring SilverEdge for **\$205 million in cash** (expected to close Q3 FY26), find SilverEdge's publicly reported or estimated annual revenue. This allows you to assess the acquisition multiple (Price/Sales) and gauge how much the acquisition will truly offset the company's current organic revenue decline.

3.  **Validate Debt/Leverage Management (Key Bear Case Constraint)**
    *   **Net Leverage Target:** Confirm management's target for the Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. The Bear Case flags debt as a risk, but the company targets approximately **3.0x** leverage, and its current ratio is around **3.3x** (Net Debt/EBITDA), or Debt/Equity is about 1.6x - 1.75x. This is significant for future M&A capacity.
    *   **Debt Reduction Plan:** Look for specific details on how the company plans to reduce leverage from the current 3.3x (Net Debt/EBITDA) to its target of 3.0x, particularly with the \$205 million cash outlay for SilverEdge. This often involves slowing share repurchases or a planned reduction in the dividend.

4.  **Organic Growth Inflection Point**
    *   **New Contract Ramps:** Search for details on when the revenue from the large contract wins mentioned in the Long Thesis (e.g., the \$1.4 billion COBRA task order) is specifically scheduled to start generating *significant* revenue. This timing is the crux of the debate between the Long and Bear cases regarding the "backlog vs. revenue decline" contradiction.

5.  **Competitive Threat Assessment**
    *   **Recompete Schedule:** Determine the next three to five largest incumbent contracts SAIC is slated to recompete (re-bid) on in the next 12-24 months. Losing a major recompete is the biggest single risk to the long-term thesis of "sticky" revenue.
