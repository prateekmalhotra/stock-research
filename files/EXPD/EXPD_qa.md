## Business Summary

Expeditors International operates as a non-asset-based logistics provider, meaning the company does not own the physical transportation vehicles like cargo ships or airplanes. It acts instead as a highly specialized organizer, or 'travel agent,' for global freight. Expeditors purchases large amounts of cargo space from airlines and shipping companies at wholesale rates and then resells this space, along with associated services, to businesses at a marked-up retail price. The core of the business model is managing the complex process of global shipping, which includes arranging air freight, ocean freight, and handling customs paperwork (customs brokerage) at international borders. The company serves a diverse global B2B customer base, primarily large and medium-sized manufacturers and retailers across various sectors, such as technology, industrial components, and consumer goods, who require complex and reliable supply chain solutions. Revenue generation is heavily reliant on the management of Air Freight and Ocean Freight movements, followed by customs and distribution services.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk for Expeditors stems from volatility in global freight rates, which can compress the profit margin (the 'spread') between what the company pays the carriers and what it charges its customers. If rates change too rapidly due to unforeseen events like geopolitical conflicts or sudden changes in capacity, it can harm immediate earnings. This risk occurred dramatically during the pandemic and subsequent market correction. Another major near-term threat is a significant global economic slowdown or trade war, as fewer goods being traded internationally automatically reduces the volume of shipments Expeditors handles, directly impacting revenue. Long-term risks center on technology and potential disintermediation. The threat is that large customers or digital platforms might eventually bypass the freight forwarder entirely to deal directly with carriers, threatening Expeditors' role as the indispensable middleman. While this has not fully occurred yet, the continuous push for digital automation is a cause for concern, requiring the company to continuously invest in technology and prove that its specialized, high-touch services justify its fees over purely automated, low-cost competitors.

### **A Detailed History of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Goal (1979 - Early 1980s)**

1.  **Founding:** The company was founded in Seattle, Washington, in 1979, initially starting as a small, single-office ocean freight forwarder.
2.  **The "Why" – A Novel Concept:** In 1981, a new group of leaders, including the influential Peter J. Rose, joined the company and introduced a revolutionary business model for the time.
3.  **The Goal:** The core mission became to offer a "one-stop shop" for international shipping. Instead of a customer having to hire one company for transportation (freight forwarding) and a completely separate one for navigating customs (customs brokerage), Expeditors offered both door-to-door services.
4.  **Core Business Model: "Asset-Light":** Expeditors chose to be a service-based company, meaning they do not own the airplanes, ships, or trucks that carry the freight. They instead contract and purchase space from major carriers and then resell and manage that space, which gives them great flexibility to find the best routes and prices for their customers.

#### **II. Early Growth and Key Milestones (1980s - 2000s)**

5.  **Rapid Initial Expansion:** The company quickly established offices in key locations like San Francisco, Chicago, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Singapore, becoming one of the largest U.S.-based forwarders of air freight from the Far East.
6.  **Going Public:** Expeditors became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1984, reporting over \$50 million in revenue in its first year as a public entity.
7.  **Global Network Building:** Selective global expansion continued, with the company entering the expansive European market by opening an office in London in 1986 and Brussels in 1990.
8.  **Commitment to Quality:** In 1991, the company formalized an internal quality program called EXCEL (Expeditors Commitment to Excellence and Leadership) to reinforce a goal of 100% customer satisfaction.

#### **III. Innovative Solutions and Competitive Advantages (Tailwinds)**

9.  **The People Advantage (Incentives):** Expeditors implemented a unique compensation structure where each branch office operates as an independent profit center, and the local management's primary pay comes from a bonus calculated directly from that branch’s operating income. This structure ensures local managers are highly motivated to run efficient and profitable operations.
10. **The Technology Backbone:** The company heavily invests in a unified, proprietary global technology system, which they call a "high-tech, high-touch" approach. This system, including a platform called CATALYST®, provides customers with real-time tracking and control over their shipments globally.
11. **Major Tailwind - Global Trade Growth:** The company was fortunate to launch and grow during a period when globalization was rapidly accelerating (the 1980s and 1990s), with more corporations needing full-service shippers to manage increasingly complex international supply chains.
12. **The Flexibility of "Asset-Light":** The asset-light model became a massive advantage (a tailwind) because it allowed the company to scale up or down quickly without the burden of maintaining its own expensive fleet of planes or ships, making it resilient across different economic cycles.

#### **IV. Problems and Headwinds Faced (Past and Present)**

13. **Dependency on External Factors (Headwind):** As a global logistics provider, the company's performance is directly tied to the health of global trade and economic conditions, making it vulnerable to recessions, inflation, and changing fuel prices.
14. **Geopolitical and Regulatory Challenges (Headwind):** Expeditors constantly faces risks from unpredictable global events like trade wars, new US tariffs, and increasing international trade restrictions, which can disrupt shipping flows and reduce demand.
15. **Intense Competition:** The logistics industry is highly competitive, with Expeditors battling massive global rivals, niche players, and new, well-funded technology startups that challenge their pricing and contracts.
16. **Fluctuating Market Dynamics:** They must constantly deal with the volatility of freight rates and capacity, experiencing periods where prices fluctuate wildly due to shifting demand and capacity constraints, which puts pressure on their profit margins.

#### **V. Present Day (A Global Logistics Leader)**

17. **Global Footprint:** Expeditors is now a Fortune 500 company that operates a vast worldwide network of over 350 locations in more than 100 countries.
18. **Service Scope:** Today, they offer comprehensive services that include air and ocean freight, customs brokerage, supply chain consulting, warehousing, and distribution, all tied together by their integrated technology systems.
19. **Goal Summary:** Expeditors’ ultimate goal remains to be the standard for excellence in global logistics by connecting all the dots—people, information, and physical goods—to make international trade seamless, efficient, and reliable for its customers.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD) is not based on owning physical assets like ships or planes, but on a unique combination of its business model, proprietary technology, and a distinct corporate culture that is difficult for competitors to copy.

### The Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Unique Culture and Compensation Model:** The company operates with an entrepreneurial culture driven by a highly decentralized, profit-sharing-based compensation system for its local and regional managers. This structure aligns employee incentives directly with the operating income and success of their local offices and ultimately with shareholder returns, which is a critical, inimitable advantage over large, centralized competitors.

2.  **Proprietary and Unified Technology:** Unlike many competitors whose IT systems are a patchwork of different platforms resulting from acquisitions, Expeditors has a single, global, in-house developed enterprise technology platform. This unified system provides employees and customers with consistent processes, deep data analytics, and real-time visibility (around 99.2% visibility) across the entire supply chain, offering a distinct competitive advantage.

3.  **Non-Asset-Based "Orchestrator" Model:** Expeditors is a non-asset-based freight forwarder; it does not own the ships or aircraft. Instead, it acts as a skilled middleman, consolidating shipments and purchasing cargo space from carriers on a volume basis to provide cost-effective solutions to its customers. This capital-light model has resulted in a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt and historically high Returns on Equity (ROE), making the business model durable.

4.  **Network Effect and Scale:** With a comprehensive global network of hundreds of offices across more than 100 countries, the size of its network itself creates a powerful network effect. The more locations and customers it serves, the greater its purchasing power with carriers and the better its ability to manage complex, multi-national logistics for customers.

### Special Positioning and Pricing Power

5.  **Focus on Custom, High-Value Services:** Expeditors is not just a transactional shipping company; it specializes in complex, high-margin services like customs brokerage, compliance, order management, and sophisticated supply chain consulting. This focus on value-added services, which accounted for approximately 36% of revenues in 2024, moves them up the value chain where they compete on service, complexity, and reliability, not just price.

6.  **Limited but Present Pricing Power:** While the freight forwarding industry is highly competitive, the combination of its unified IT system, superior service, and expertise in complex global trade allows Expeditors to maintain healthy operating margins. By providing customized, solution-based services, they can command pricing that reflects this complexity and scope, demonstrating a form of pricing power, especially compared to less-integrated, purely transactional competitors.

### Customer Stickiness and Contracts

7.  **Customers are Sticky and Contracts are Recurring:** The business of managing a customer's entire, complex global supply chain, including customs and compliance, is inherently sticky. Switching logistics partners is costly, time-consuming, and risky for a company's operations, leading to long-standing, recurring customer relationships. Furthermore, the company's revenue is diversified, as no single customer accounts for more than five percent of its total revenues, indicating a broad base of recurring business.

### Historical Growth and Displacement

8.  **Reason for Growth (The "How"):** Expeditors grew into what it is today by relentlessly pursuing **organic growth** (avoiding messy acquisitions), establishing a **capital-light model**, and fostering its **unique culture**. This consistent strategy allowed it to build an internally consistent, global network and a single IT system over decades, which provided compounding benefits in efficiency and service quality.

9.  **Difficulty of Displacement by Capital:** It is difficult for a competitor with more capital to displace Expeditors quickly because the moat is not a single asset that can be bought. Replicating the **unique, decades-old, profit-sharing corporate culture** and building a **single, unified, proprietary global IT system** from scratch to integrate across a vast network would take many years and significant organizational effort, which a capital influx alone cannot instantly solve.

### Innovation and R&D

10. **Investment in Innovation (R&D):** Expeditors' primary form of "R&D" is its ongoing investment in its proprietary enterprise technology platform and systems, which it views as vital to achieving a competitive advantage. They leverage technology for real-time tracking, data analytics, and workflow automation, leading to operational efficiency and customer retention.

11. **Need for Constant Innovation:** While its core cultural and network advantages are durable, the company must constantly innovate its technological capabilities to maintain its edge in the rapidly changing logistics industry. This includes updating its platform and developing new customized solutions to meet evolving customer demands for better supply chain visibility and efficiency.

## Catalyst Analysis

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD) operates as a non-asset-based global logistics company, meaning its success often hinges on market volatility, operational efficiency, and effective capital management.

Here is an analysis of the key catalysts for its stock price in the near and long term, based on recent financial results and management commentary from Q1 2024 through Q2 2025.

---

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 12-18 Months)

1.  **Geopolitical and Supply Chain Disruption Benefits:** Unpredictability and instability in global shipping, such as conflicts in the Middle East/Red Sea, continue to cause longer ocean transit times and tight capacity, which can lead to higher average rates and increased growth for Expeditors. Management noted in late 2024 and early 2025 that disruption-driven ocean demand and longer sailings due to Red Sea insecurity significantly impacted rates and strained capacity.

2.  **Strong E-commerce Demand and Volume Growth:** A surge in international direct e-commerce is driving strong airfreight tonnage growth, as seen with a 15% year-over-year increase in air tonnage in Q2 2024. In Q1 2025, the company continued to show volume growth with airfreight tonnage up 9% and ocean container volume up 8%.

3.  **Capital Return to Shareholders:** Management continues to strategically return capital to shareholders through dividends and aggressive stock repurchases. In Q2 2025, the company returned $335 million to shareholders, reinforcing its commitment to managing its cash-heavy balance sheet. The company has returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders in each of the three years leading up to the end of 2024.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 18 Months)

1.  **Recovery in Global Trade and Shipper Demand:** A return to a stable, but stronger, global economic environment where cautious shipper demand stabilizes would provide a more consistent revenue foundation. Management repeatedly notes the difficulty in predicting the short- and longer-term future, citing fragile economies and variable rate stability. A clearer economic outlook would reduce market volatility, potentially leading to more stable earnings.

2.  **Increased Market Share through Core Strategy:** Expeditors' core strategy is based on its non-asset-based model, which leverages technology and skilled professionals to manage complex logistics. Management continues to invest significantly in cybersecurity and other technology to strengthen current systems and deploy new solutions, which is intended to protect and upgrade service offerings and support long-term growth.

3.  **New Leadership and Strategic Focus:** The company recently appointed a new CFO in August 2025 and announced a new CEO to take the position in March 2025. A fresh leadership team could potentially introduce new strategies for sustained growth and profitability beyond capitalizing on temporary market volatility.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy

*   **On Unpredictability and Growth:** Management stated the short- and longer-term future is as unpredictable for them as for everyone, but they are focused on growing volumes and managing costs to deliver strong operating efficiency. They specifically noted a rise in complex customs clearances that require greater skill.
*   **On Capital Allocation:** Management's strategy emphasizes its financial strength, noting they generated substantial cash from operations, a portion of which is used to fund significant stock buybacks and dividends, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing shareholder value.
*   **On Technology Investment (Strategy):** A key element of the long-term strategy is significant investment in technology, particularly cybersecurity, to protect and upgrade systems while also developing new solutions for enhanced customer service.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.'s (EXPD) compensation and incentive materials, the management structure appears to be strongly aligned with shareholder interests, primarily through a highly performance-driven pay model.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Absolute Insider Ownership:** The total individual insider ownership (managers and directors) is relatively low, generally reported between **0.8% and 2.15%** of the company's shares. [cite: 1, 2, 4 (from Step 1)] However, this figure is considered by some analysts to still represent a degree of incentive alignment. [cite: 2 (from Step 1)]

2.  **Long-Term Stock Retention Policy:** To enforce a long-term view, executives are required to hold **75% of the net after-tax shares** received from the vesting of equity awards (PSUs and RSUs) until they meet their official executive stock ownership guidelines. The company also prohibits hedging or pledging of company stock.

3.  **Recent Insider Selling:** Over the last year, there has been noted insider selling of shares with no recorded purchases, which is a potential mild negative signal that may warrant caution. [cite: 2, 3 (from Step 1)]

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

1.  **High "At-Risk" Pay:** The compensation structure is characterized by an intentionally low base salary, with more than **97% of the CEO's total pay being "at risk"** and directly linked to performance metrics, a strong indicator of pay-for-performance.

2.  **Profitability-Driven Annual Incentives:** The core incentive plan dictates that non-equity (cash) bonuses are paid out at a fixed percentage of **U.S. GAAP Operating Income**. This directly links a majority of cash compensation to the company's annual profitability.

3.  **Cumulative and Growth Profit Requirements:** A significant feature is that no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is **cumulatively profitable from inception**. Furthermore, senior management is subject to a performance expectation of achieving a **5% year-over-year operating income growth** to earn an unreduced payout.

4.  **Multi-Metric Long-Term Equity:** The long-term incentive component includes **Performance Share Units (PSUs)** that vest only upon the achievement of specific **3-year performance goals**. The most important financial performance measures used are **Operating Income, Earnings per Share (EPS), and Net Revenues** (non-GAAP).

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

1.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** Expeditors' management has a strong incentive to act in the interest of shareholders due to the unique compensation structure that ties the vast majority of executive pay directly to key value-creating metrics like **Operating Income and EPS growth** over both annual and three-year periods.

2.  **Incentive to Drive Shareholder Value:** The emphasis on **cumulative profitability** and the requirement for **year-over-year profit growth** ensure that management's focus is on sustainable and disciplined financial performance rather than short-term gains.

3.  **Mitigation of Personal Pocket-Lining:** The structure—characterized by low base salaries, high performance-based pay, mandatory stock retention, and a decline in executive bonuses corresponding with a drop in operating income—serves as a powerful mechanism to deter "lining their own pockets" unless shareholder returns (profitability) are also being generated.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Expeditors rests on its role as the indispensable global supply chain organizer, benefiting both from chaos and stability. In the near term, geopolitical disruptions (like the Red Sea issues) are driving up freight rates and making shipping more complex, increasing demand for Expeditors’ high-margin, specialized services (like customs handling and air freight solutions). The company is capitalizing on this cash flow surge by aggressively returning money to shareholders through stock buybacks. Long term, the company’s moat—its unique profit-sharing culture that motivates local managers, and its unified, proprietary technology platform—makes it highly resilient and cost-efficient. This asset-light model, combined with a proven management team, ensures that as global trade inevitably stabilizes and recovers, Expeditors will capture market share and translate rising shipping volumes into high, sustainable profit growth without the financial risk of owning physical transportation assets.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This positive scenario assumes that global trade volumes recover significantly over the next few years after the recent slowdowns. It also relies on the belief that Expeditors can maintain its competitive advantage—that its unique culture and proprietary technology system will continue to be superior to those of rivals, preventing customers from switching to cheaper, less integrated competitors. Finally, it assumes management continues to prioritize disciplined financial management, using strong cash flow to fund share repurchases and ensure strong shareholder returns.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for Expeditors International (EXPD) is built on a mixture of cyclical upswings, temporary geopolitical factors, and a belief in a durable competitive moat. However, a deeper look reveals several flaws and major risks, especially concerning the sustainability of high profit margins and the durability of their technology edge in a highly competitive and cyclical industry.

### Critique and Flaws in the Bull Thesis

#### 1. Unsustainable Near-Term Profit Drivers & Cyclical Risk
*   **Near-Term "Chaos" Benefit is Transient:** The recent strong volume and earnings growth (e.g., Q1 2025 EPS up 26%) is heavily attributed to a non-recurring "pull-forward" of shipments by customers anticipating new trade tariffs and the temporary rerouting of vessels due to geopolitical issues like the Red Sea conflict. These one-time boosts will dissipate as the market normalizes, making future revenues less predictable.
*   **Freight Rate Normalization Squeezes Margins:** The high-margin period for freight forwarders tends to reverse as carrier rates decrease due to market oversupply. As the freight market remains weak and liner companies engage in price competition, Expeditors' core air and ocean net revenues are expected to underperform, with Q2 2025 projections showing year-over-year declines for both.
*   **Rising Operating Costs Undermine Margin Thesis:** Despite volume gains, Expeditors is facing rising operating expenses (up 20.5% year-over-year in Q1 2025), driven by surging costs in ocean and air freight services (up 38.6% and 20.6% respectively). This cost inflation directly threatens the "high, sustainable profit growth" promised by the asset-light model.

#### 2. The Competitive Moat is Shrinking and Expensive to Maintain
*   **"Proprietary Technology" is Not Unique Anymore:** The logistics sector is rapidly digitizing, and major competitors like DHL, Kuehne + Nagel, and UPS are making massive and prioritized investments in technology, offering competitive or even superior digital platforms, which directly challenges the claim of a "unique" technology moat. The continued need for "significant investments in cybersecurity and other technology" is a necessary operational cost, not a guaranteed source of competitive advantage.
*   **Culture/Service Moat is Vulnerable to Price:** Expeditors' competitive advantage rests on high service quality and local profit-sharing culture, but the search results indicate they "Tend to be a bit more expensive than other forwarders." In a normalizing freight market where customers are intensely focused on price and volume is declining, the premium for service may not be enough to prevent switching to cheaper rivals.
*   **Vulnerability to Digital Disintermediation:** As an asset-light intermediary, Expeditors is theoretically vulnerable to disintermediation, where shippers and carriers use new digital platforms, AI, and advanced data integration to deal with each other directly, bypassing the traditional forwarder role.

#### 3. Financial and Valuation Concerns
*   **Ineffective Buybacks at Elevated Valuation:** While the company *is* returning capital, a portion of the positive EPS growth in recent years has been artificially supported by a declining share count from buybacks. Aggressive buybacks at the stock's current, potentially overvalued P/E ratio (e.g., 20.39 as of Q3 2025) may not create substantial long-term shareholder value, especially if earnings contract.
*   **Analyst Caution and Stock Underperformance:** The stock is trading at a high valuation and, despite strong recent *quarterly* performance driven by anomalies, has underperformed the S&P 500. The analyst consensus is highly mixed, including "Moderate Sell" and "Strong Sell" recommendations, reflecting skepticism about the sustainability of their margins and growth.

***

### Bear Case Thesis

The bull thesis fundamentally misjudges the temporary nature of the current tailwinds and overestimates the durability of Expeditors' competitive moat against an increasingly sophisticated and cost-conscious industry.

**Bear Case Thesis:** **Expeditors International (EXPD) is a high-quality logistics company whose stock is currently priced for an unsustainable peak-cycle environment, leaving it highly vulnerable to severe margin compression and volume normalization.** The recent surge in earnings is a *temporary* windfall driven by non-recurring import pull-forward ahead of tariffs and Red Sea diversions, which will dissipate and lead to an earnings contraction, with analysts projecting a full-year EPS decline for fiscal 2025. As global trade volumes normalize and a freight market oversupply continues, *aggressive price competition* from container lines and rival forwarders (who are rapidly closing the technology gap) will erode the "spread" profit margin, proving that Expeditors' price premium and culture-based moat are not strong enough to withstand cyclical pressure. The strategy of using a large cash pile for disciplined share repurchases will become less effective at its current elevated valuation, culminating in a significant devaluation as the company's profitability reverts to the industry's mean in a classic freight forwarding downturn.

## Next Steps

Based on your thorough analysis of Expeditors International (EXPD), you have successfully mapped out the bull case (culture/tech moat, capitalizing on chaos) against the bear case (unsustainable short-term drivers, technological catch-up by rivals, and a looming freight oversupply).

The important questions that remain unanswered focus on quantifying the resilience of the non-financial moats (culture and technology) and translating the looming industry risks into a tangible impact on Expeditors' core profitability metrics (Gross Profit per shipment).

Here are the important next steps and questions for your investigation, categorized by the area of focus.

---

## Next Steps for Investigation (Unanswered Questions)

### **1. Quantifying the "Moat" and Competitive Position**

This step challenges the core thesis that Expeditors' proprietary technology and culture are truly superior and not merely competitive.

*   **Financializing the Technology Moat:** Investigate if there are any current metrics that track the efficiency gains from Expeditors' technology investments, such as: **What is the current (Q2 2025) ratio of operating expenses (Salaries/IT) per shipment volume (Air kg / Ocean TEU) compared to its top peers?** This is a key measure of the efficiency derived from the "unified IT system."
*   **Assessing Customer Sentiment & "Stickiness":** Seek out recent, independent industry surveys or Gartner/Forrester reports (if available via subscription) that rank the overall "ease of doing business" (EODB), supply chain visibility, or digital platform features for EXPD against rivals like **Kuehne + Nagel's KN ESP or DSV's myDSV platform.** This will help validate or disprove the claim of superior service/technology.
*   **The Culture Premium:** Find out the actual average commission rate/bonus paid to local branch managers as a percentage of operating income and how this compares to industry standards. **Does the unique compensation structure truly prevent staff turnover or is it only a differentiating factor during high-margin years?**

### **2. Modeling the Cyclical Risk (The 'Spread' and Normalization)**

This step forces you to move from general industry forecasts to a specific impact on Expeditors' profitability.

*   **Gross Profit Per Shipment Projection:** The key profit metric for a freight forwarder is the difference (the "spread") between what it charges the customer and what it pays the carrier. You should now attempt to model a worst-case scenario: **What is the projected Gross Profit per TEU (ocean) and Gross Profit per kg (air) for H2 2026, assuming ocean spot rates fall by 20% and air freight capacity constraints finally ease?**
*   **Impact of Red Sea Reversion:** Quantify the financial risk: **What percentage of Expeditors' current air/ocean gross profit margin is specifically attributable to the longer transit times and higher spot prices caused by the Red Sea diversions?** This is the direct risk the company faces if geopolitics stabilize quickly.
*   **Customs Brokerage Resilience:** Your analysis notes that high-margin customs brokerage is key. **What is the customer churn rate for customs brokerage clients relative to general freight forwarding customers?** This helps gauge how "sticky" the highest-margin service truly is, as a defense against volume declines.

### **3. Management Strategy and Capital Allocation**

This step focuses on how the new leadership and financial discipline are handling the immediate challenges.

*   **New Leadership's Defined Strategy:** Search for recent investor day presentations or formal strategic updates from the new CEO, Daniel R. Wall (post-March 2025). **Has the new leadership team announced any specific financial or operational targets (e.g., target Operating Margin, target Air/Ocean Gross Profit margin) that differ from the previous management's long-term plan?**
*   **Buyback Effectiveness at Current Valuation:** Investigate the average price of the most recent quarterly stock buybacks (Q2 2025 average price is known to be $112.05). **How does the current stock repurchase price compare to your calculated intrinsic value (using the projected 2026 EPS/FCF from your modeling)?** This will determine if the buyback program is currently value-accretive or destructive.
*   **Technology Investment Quantification:** Seek out the actual dollar amount or percentage of revenue/OpEx that Expeditors allocates to "investment in its proprietary enterprise technology platform and systems" for the most recent two quarters. **How does this R&D/IT expenditure compare as a percentage of revenue to the major competitors (DHL, KN) who announced multi-billion dollar programs?** This will measure if their "innovation" spending is keeping pace.
