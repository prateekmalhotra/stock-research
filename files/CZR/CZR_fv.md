### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

The revenue model is built on the three main segments: **Las Vegas**, **Regional**, and **Caesars Digital**, with projections conservatively derived from management's guidance and world-knowledge of the gaming industry's growth trajectory.

#### Business Engine Assumptions:

1.  **Las Vegas Segment:** The Las Vegas leisure market has shown softness (Q2 2025 commentary) but management anticipates **strong group bookings in Q4 2025 and into 2026**. Assuming a conservative recovery, we project a modest rebound in 2025 followed by stability.
    *   **2025:** Modest growth from a soft 2024/2025 base, driven by strong group bookings in the back half.
    *   **2026 - 2030:** Assumed 1.0% annual growth, reflecting a mature market environment with stable group business offsetting potential volatility in leisure/gaming.
2.  **Regional Segment:** Management projects this segment to be **flat or see slight growth for FY2025**, driven by new properties (e.g., Caesars Virginia, New Orleans) and strategic reinvestment in the loyalty program (Caesars Rewards).
    *   **2025:** Conservatively projected at a slight 1.0% growth.
    *   **2026 - 2030:** A conservative 0.5% annual growth is applied, reflecting its status as a mature, highly competitive segment with limited geographic expansion potential.
3.  **Caesars Digital Segment:** This is the high-growth engine, which reported its "best quarter ever" in Q2 2025 and is **firmly on track to achieve an Adjusted EBITDA target of over $500 million by 2026**.
    *   **2024 Digital Revenue:** Reported as $1.2 billion for the full year 2024.
    *   **2025/2026:** To reach the 2026 EBITDA target, significant revenue growth is required. Assuming the segment achieves an approximate 15% net income margin (a conservative estimate for a maturing digital platform) on $500M EBITDA, it implies substantial revenue growth. Based on the $343M Q2 2025 net revenue for Digital (annualizing to ~$1.4B), and its 24.3% YoY Q2 growth, we project continued deceleration from high growth.
    *   **2027 - 2030:** Growth rate conservatively tapers as the market matures and competition increases, eventually settling to a conservative 5% annual growth rate.

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

#### Margin Assumptions:

CZR is currently operating at a TTM Net Income Margin of **-1.71%**, with a Net Loss of $82 million in Q2 2025. Management's goal of achieving financial targets and debt reduction is key to future profitability.

1.  **Transition to Profitability:** The company is strategically focused on reducing its massive debt load. The Q2 2025 note redemption already **reduces annual interest expense by $44 million**, which directly impacts Net Income.
2.  **Digital Profitability:** The high-margin Digital segment is accelerating toward a significant EBITDA target, which will substantially improve the consolidated margin.
3.  **Conservative Net Income Margin:** Given the company's historical unprofitability but clear path to positive EBITDA from Digital and lower interest expense, we project a very conservative, gradual transition to a stable, low single-digit Net Income Margin.

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assumed Net Income Margin %** | 0.0% | 1.0% | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.0% |
| **Net Income from Revenue** (A) | $0 | $122 | $250 | $320 | $391 | $399 |
| **Prior Year Net Income** (B) | N/A | $0 | $126 | $268 | $356 | $460 |
| **ROIC %** (Conservative, Historical TTM is 7.30%) | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| **ROIC Income** (B x ROIC %) (C) | N/A | $0 | $6 | $13 | $18 | $23 |
| **Projected Net Income** (A + C) | **$0** | **$122** | **$256** | **$333** | **$409** | **$422** |

*Note: For 2025, Net Income is conservatively modeled at $0, acknowledging the prior losses but factoring in the initial $44M interest savings.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The projected Net Income is used as a proxy for unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the DCF calculation, as per the rules: *Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.*

#### Rate Assumptions:

| Metric | Rationale | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | A conservative but reasonable rate for a high-leverage, mature gaming company with a high beta. | 9.0% |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** (Maturity Rate) | A very conservative, long-term growth rate for a mature, capital-intensive industry. | 1.0% |

#### Projected Cash Flows (Net Present Value - NPV)

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (FCF Proxy) (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.09)^t) | Net Present Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $0 | 0.9174 | $0 |
| **2026** | $122 | 0.8417 | $103 |
| **2027** | $256 | 0.7722 | $198 |
| **2028** | $333 | 0.7084 | $236 |
| **2029** | $409 | 0.6499 | $266 |
| **2030** | $422 | 0.5963 | $252 |
| **Total NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **$1,055** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation:

The terminal value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   Terminal Value (TV) in 2030 = [FCF (2030) x (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV in 2030 = [ $422 million x (1 + 0.01) ] / (0.09 - 0.01)
*   TV in 2030 = $426.22 million / 0.08
*   **TV in 2030 = $5,328 million**

#### Net Present Value of Terminal Value:

*   NPV of TV = TV (2030) x Discount Factor (2030)
*   NPV of TV = $5,328 million x 0.5963
*   **NPV of TV = $3,178 million**

#### Total Equity Value:

*   Total Enterprise Value (TEV) = NPV of Explicit Period + NPV of Terminal Value
*   TEV = $1,055 million + $3,178 million = **$4,233 million**
*   Equity Value = TEV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
*   Equity Value = $4,233 million + $982 million - $12,300 million
*   **Equity Value = -$7,085 million**

### V. Fair Value Per Share & Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Equity Value** | -$7,085 million |
| **Weighted Average Diluted Shares Outstanding** | 216 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **-$32.80** |

#### Fair Value Justification and Comparison to Market Value

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **-$32.80** |
| **Current Stock Price** (Oct 24, 2025) | **$22.23** |

My calculated fair value is **negative $32.80 per share**, which is drastically different from the current market price of **$22.23 per share**.

The valuation gap is substantial and is entirely due to the company's massive **Total Debt of $12.3 billion**. The current cash flow projection is insufficient to service this debt while simultaneously generating a positive equity value.

#### Why the Market Disagrees with the DCF:

The market's willingness to value CZR at **$22.23 per share** implies that investors are making one or more of the following fundamental assumptions that are not captured in a conservative, unadjusted Net Income-based DCF:

1.  **Higher Free Cash Flow (FCF) than Net Income:** The market is likely valuing CZR on **Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**, which is significantly higher than Net Income due to non-cash charges like **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**. In the gaming industry, D&A is immense due to the high capital cost of resorts. For a DCF using Net Income as a FCF proxy, this non-cash expense is already subtracted, leading to a massive undervaluation relative to the market. The true FCF available for debt reduction is likely much higher than the Net Income figures used here.
    *   **Evidence:** Management frequently guides on **Adjusted EBITDA** (e.g., Digital $500M by 2026), suggesting the market uses this higher metric for valuation.
2.  **Asset Sales and Strategic Monetization:** The market is factoring in future debt reduction via asset sales or strategic transactions, such as the potential separation of the Digital business, which would unlock significant cash to pay down the $12.3 billion debt.
3.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate or Lower Discount Rate:** The market is likely projecting a much more aggressive long-term growth rate or using a lower WACC, reflecting optimism about the company's ability to deleverage and realize cost synergies from its merger. A higher Terminal Value would be necessary to offset the massive debt.
4.  **REIT Structure Benefits:** A large portion of CZR's debt is offset by leased assets from its former real estate investment trust (REIT) arrangement, which the market views as a long-term operating expense rather than a debt burden that must be fully paid off with FCF.

**Conclusion:** The negative fair value is a direct consequence of following the rule to use **Net Income as a conservative FCF proxy** for a company with an extremely high debt load and significant non-cash expenses (D&A). The market is effectively valuing the company's operating assets (based on EBITDA/FCFF) and assumes a successful, non-organic (i.e., asset sales) debt reduction strategy to justify the current price. For this DCF model to equal the current price, the Equity Value would need to be approximately $4.8 billion (216M shares x $22.23/share), requiring a Total Enterprise Value of roughly $17.1 billion ($4.8B + $12.3B - $0.982B), or a Terminal Value more than triple the one calculated.
