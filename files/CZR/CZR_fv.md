### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Caesars Entertainment's business engine is segmented into: **Las Vegas**, **Regional**, and **Caesars Digital**. The revenue projections are built on the last full year's consolidated performance (FY 2024) and management's forward-looking guidance.

**FY 2024 Baseline (Consolidated Same-Store):**
*   Net Revenues: **$11.2 Billion**
*   EBITDA Margin: **33.2%**

**Business Engine Assumptions and Justification:**

1.  **Caesars Digital (Growth Engine):** This is the key growth driver. Management is confident in attaining **$500 million+ Adjusted EBITDA by 2026** (Step 1).
    *   *Assumption:* The segment EBITDA is projected to reach $500M in 2026. Assuming a conservative EBITDA margin of 20% (up from 23.3% in Q2 2025 (Step 1)) this implies a 2026 Digital Revenue of $2,500M. For a conservative estimate, I will assume a step-function to this target by 2026 and moderate growth thereafter.
    *   *Digital Revenue Projections (M USD):*
        *   2024 (Baseline): ~$1,350M (Implied from Q3 YTD $989M and Q4 $303M)
        *   2025: **$1,900** (Ramp-up)
        *   2026: **$2,500** (Achieving target and implied revenue)
        *   2027-2030: **+10% YoY** (A conservative growth rate, given the market will mature).

2.  **Las Vegas (Core Stable Asset):** The market experienced "softness" in Q3 2025, but management expects improvement into Q4 2025 and strengthening outlook into **2026** due to group bookings and CapEx projects (Flamingo, Cromwell rebrand, etc.) (Step 1),.
    *   *Assumption:* I assume a mild recovery in 2025 followed by stability. Las Vegas revenue is a function of occupancy and Average Daily Rate (ADR). Given CapEx and group business strength, I project low single-digit growth.
    *   *Las Vegas Revenue Projections (M USD):*
        *   2024 (Baseline): ~$4,100M (Implied from Q3 YTD $3,009M and an estimated Q4 of ~$1,100M)
        *   2025: **$4,140** (+1.0% YoY)
        *   2026: **$4,264** (+3.0% YoY, benefiting from strong group bookings)
        *   2027-2030: **+2.0% YoY** (Stable, low-growth)

3.  **Regional (Stable/Cash Cow):** Expected to return to flat or **positive EBITDA for full year 2025** (Step 1).
    *   *Assumption:* Regional will be a stable asset, benefiting from minimal CapEx reinvestment and loyalty program strength, growing at a modest inflation-plus rate.
    *   *Regional Revenue Projections (M USD):*
        *   2024 (Baseline): ~$5,300M (Implied from Q3 YTD $4,359M and estimated Q4)
        *   2025-2030: **+1.5% YoY**

**Total Projected Revenue (in Millions USD):**

| Year | Las Vegas (M) | Regional (M) | Digital (M) | Total Revenue (M) | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual Base)** | $4,100 | $5,300 | $1,350 | **$10,750** | |
| **2025 (Projection)** | $4,140 | $5,380 | $1,900 | **$11,420** | 6.2% |
| **2026 (Projection)** | $4,264 | $5,461 | $2,500 | **$12,225** | 7.0% |
| **2027 (Projection)** | $4,350 | $5,543 | $2,750 | **$12,643** | 3.4% |
| **2028 (Projection)** | $4,437 | $5,626 | $3,025 | **$13,088** | 3.5% |
| **2029 (Projection)** | $4,526 | $5,711 | $3,328 | **$13,565** | 3.6% |
| **2030 (Projection)** | $4,617 | $5,797 | $3,660 | **$14,074** | 3.8% |

### 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection

**Margin Assumptions:**
*   **Net Income Margin:** The company has historically been unprofitable (Net Loss of $252M YTD Sep 30, 2025). However, the digital segment is now profitable, and the core business is stabilizing. For conservatism, the net income margin is projected to be very low and then slightly improve as interest expense (which is substantial due to high debt) is paid down and the digital segment scales.
    *   2025: **1.0%** (Initial profitability, very conservative)
    *   2026: **1.5%**
    *   2027 - 2030: **2.0%** (Assuming cost efficiencies and stable operations)

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**
*   The historical ROIC is 7.06% (Step 1). Given the instruction to use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC when projecting positive Net Income for a previously unprofitable company, I will use a **conservative ROIC of 5.0%** to model additional income from reinvested cash.

**Net Income Calculation:**
*   Net Income (NI) Year N = (Total Revenue N * Margin %) + (NI N-1 * ROIC)

| Year | Total Revenue (M) | Net Income Margin | Base NI (M) | Previous NI (M) | ROIC (5.0%) | ROIC Income (M) | Total Net Income (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $11,420 | 1.0% | $114.20 | $0.00 | 5.0% | $0.00 | **$114.20** |
| **2026** | $12,225 | 1.5% | $183.38 | $114.20 | 5.0% | $5.71 | **$189.09** |
| **2027** | $12,643 | 2.0% | $252.86 | $189.09 | 5.0% | $9.45 | **$262.31** |
| **2028** | $13,088 | 2.0% | $261.76 | $262.31 | 5.0% | $13.12 | **$274.88** |
| **2029** | $13,565 | 2.0% | $271.30 | $274.88 | 5.0% | $13.74 | **$285.04** |
| **2030** | $14,074 | 2.0% | $281.48 | $285.04 | 5.0% | $14.25 | **$295.73** |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative but reasonable rate is chosen. Given the high Debt-to-Equity ratio (6.47 (Step 1)) and high interest expenses, the cost of capital is significant. I will use the conservative estimate of **9.0%**, slightly higher than the 8.30% suggested for WACC in a financial data snippet (Step 1).
*   **Terminal/Maturity Rate (g):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate is assumed, reflecting the mature nature of the casino industry and regulatory environment. A conservative **1.5%** is used.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
The terminal value assumes the 2030 net income will grow forever at the maturity rate.

*   Terminal Value = [Net Income (2030) * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
*   TV = [$295.73 M * (1 + 0.015)] / (0.09 - 0.015)
*   TV = $300.17 M / 0.075
*   **Terminal Value = $4,002.27 Million**

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Year (N) | Total Net Income (M) | Discount Factor [1 / (1 + WACC)^N] | NPV of Cash Flow (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (N=1)** | $114.20 | 0.9174 | $104.76 |
| **2026 (N=2)** | $189.09 | 0.8417 | $159.18 |
| **2027 (N=3)** | $262.31 | 0.7722 | $202.50 |
| **2028 (N=4)** | $274.88 | 0.7084 | $194.75 |
| **2029 (N=5)** | $285.04 | 0.6499 | $185.25 |
| **2030 (N=6)** | $295.73 | 0.5963 | $176.35 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | $4,002.27 | 0.5963 | $2,387.65 |
| | | | **Total NPV = $3,410.44 Million** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

**Fair Value of Equity:**

*   Fair Value of Equity = Total NPV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
*   Fair Value of Equity = $3,410.44 M + $836 M - $11,923 M
*   **Fair Value of Equity = -$7,676.56 Million**

**Fair Value Per Share:**

*   Fair Value Per Share = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value Per Share = -$7,676.56 M / 204.11 M shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share = -$37.61**

***

### Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value of Stock: -$37.61**
**Current Market Price: $21.96**

The calculated fair value of the stock is **negative**, which is a significant departure from the current market price of $21.96 per share.

**Justification for the Negative Fair Value (The Market's Assumptions vs. My Conservative Assumptions):**

The core reason for the negative fair value is the **massive debt load** relative to the projected future net income.

1.  **The Debt-Centric Valuation Problem:**
    *   Total Debt ($11.923 B) is approximately 3.5 times the Total NPV ($3.41 B). In this Net Income-based DCF model, the future cash flows are insufficient to pay off the existing debt and still generate a positive equity value.
    *   ***Market's Assumption:*** The market is likely valuing CZR based on **Enterprise Value to Adjusted EBITDA** multiples, which is common in the casino industry. CZR’s high leverage (Debt/Equity 6.47 (Step 1)) means most of the underlying asset value is owed to debt holders. The market is assigning significant value to the growth potential of **Caesars Digital** and the stable **Las Vegas/Regional** EBITDA, believing these cash flows (EBITDA) will allow the company to successfully deleverage over time.
    *   ***My Assumption:*** My valuation strictly follows the Net Income/Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) to Equity method, which is very sensitive to interest expense (embedded in the Net Income calculation) and the absolute debt balance. The Net Income margins used (1.0% to 2.0%) are extremely depressed due to the high interest expense incurred from the $11.9 billion debt.

2.  **Conservative Projections:**
    *   **Net Income Margins:** My Net Income margins of 1.0% to 2.0% are very conservative, reflecting the historical lack of profitability. The market is likely pricing in a far more optimistic and faster expansion of margin, expecting the digital segment's profitability to quickly offset corporate losses and interest expenses.
    *   **ROIC:** A conservative 5.0% ROIC was used, which is lower than the historical 7.06% (Step 1). A more aggressive ROIC would increase future cash flow, but not enough to overcome the massive debt.
    *   **Discount Rate:** A 9.0% discount rate is relatively high and conservatively discounts the value of future earnings more aggressively.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The market is fundamentally making a bet that the **Caesars Digital** segment will meet or exceed its **$500M+ EBITDA target for 2026** and that this, coupled with stable, cash-generating physical assets, will enable the company to generate *significantly more Free Cash Flow* (FCF) than implied by my Net Income-based model, which will then be used to rapidly pay down the substantial debt. The DCF to Equity model, when applied strictly to a highly leveraged company, often results in a negative equity value unless the Net Income margin explodes upward to compensate for the interest expense and subsequent large debt subtraction. The market is assigning a premium to the **operational excellence and growth narrative** that my conservative, mathematically bound Net Income-based model cannot capture.
