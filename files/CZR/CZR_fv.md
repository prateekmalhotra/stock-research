## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Caesars Entertainment's business engine consists of two primary segments:
1.  **Brick-and-Mortar Operations (Las Vegas and Regional):** Stable, mature assets.
2.  **Caesars Digital (Sports Betting and iGaming):** High-growth, relatively new segment.

The projection methodology is based on segment-specific growth rates derived from management's commentary in the last four earnings calls.

### A. Brick-and-Mortar (Las Vegas and Regional) Engine

Management commentary suggests the brick-and-mortar segment is relatively stable, with Las Vegas poised for a "record EBITDA year in 2025" due to strong group bookings (mix increasing to 17% in Q4 2025) and ongoing capital reinvestments, while Regional operations are also showing growth from new properties [cite: 5, 4 (in step 1)].

| Segment | 2024 Revenue (Implied from SEC Filing/Earnings) | 2025-2027 Growth Rate | 2028-2030 Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Las Vegas & Regional** | \$9,813 ((\$11,245 Total Revenue - \$1,163 Digital Revenue) - \$269 M&B/Corp) | 2.0% | 1.5% | **Conservative Growth:** Assumes modest growth driven by full realization of CapEx projects, slight ADR/occupancy improvements in Las Vegas (offsetting 'soft' summer noted in Q3 2025), and maturation of new regional assets (Danville, New Orleans). Long-term growth reverts to a low rate consistent with a mature industry. |

### B. Caesars Digital Engine

The Digital segment is the primary growth driver, with management targeting **\$500 million+ in Adjusted EBITDA by 2026** [cite: 4 (in step 1)]. In 2024, Digital revenue was \$1,163 million and Adjusted EBITDA was \$117 million.

**Projection Logic:**
1.  **2025-2026:** Aggressive growth is necessary to reach the management's **\$500 million EBITDA target by 2026**. I will assume a conservative EBITDA of **\$500 million** is achieved in 2026.
2.  **Digital Margin:** 2024 Adj. EBITDA margin was 10.06% (\$117/\$1,163). To achieve \$500M EBITDA on reasonable revenue, the margin must expand significantly due to scale, lower promotional spend, and operating leverage.
    *   *Assumption:* I project the Digital Adjusted EBITDA margin to reach **25.0% by 2026** and then stabilize at a mature, conservative **28.0%** by 2030.
3.  **2026 Revenue Target:** \$500M EBITDA / 25.0% Margin = **\$2,000 million (2.0B) Revenue in 2026**. This implies a 72% compounded revenue growth from 2024 to 2026, which is aggressive but necessary to meet management's own $500M EBITDA guidance.
4.  **2027-2030:** The segment continues to grow, but at a declining rate as the market matures and competition stabilizes.

| Segment | 2024 Revenue (Actual) | 2025 Revenue Growth | 2026 Revenue Growth | 2027 Revenue Growth | 2028-2030 Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Caesars Digital** | \$1,163 | 35.0% | 35.0% | 15.0% | 8.0% |
| **Implied 2026 Revenue** | | | **\$2,084** | | |

### C. Total Revenue Projection

| Year | Brick-and-Mortar Revenue | Digital Revenue | Total Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$9,813 | \$1,163 | **\$11,245** |
| **2025** | \$10,009 (2.0% YoY) | \$1,570 (35.0% YoY) | **\$11,579** |
| **2026** | \$10,210 (2.0% YoY) | \$2,119 (35.0% YoY) | **\$12,329** |
| **2027** | \$10,414 (2.0% YoY) | \$2,437 (15.0% YoY) | **\$12,851** |
| **2028** | \$10,570 (1.5% YoY) | \$2,632 (8.0% YoY) | **\$13,202** |
| **2029** | \$10,728 (1.5% YoY) | \$2,842 (8.0% YoY) | **\$13,570** |
| **2030** | \$10,889 (1.5% YoY) | \$3,070 (8.0% YoY) | **\$13,959** |

## 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections (2025 - 2030)

### A. Margin and Income Assumptions

| Metric | 2024 (Actual) | 2025-2027 | 2028-2030 | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBITDA Margin (Consolidated)** | 33.2% | 34.0% | 35.0% | **Conservative Improvement:** Based on: (1) high-margin Digital segment growth; (2) realization of CapEx returns; (3) lower G&A/reinvestment levels noted by management. |
| **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)** | \$1,324 (2024) | \$1,350 | \$1,400 | **Conservative:** Assumes D&A remains high due to large asset base and continued CapEx. |
| **Interest Expense (Cash)** | \$879 (YTD Sep 2024) | \$850 | \$800 | **Conservative Reduction:** Reflects management's focus on debt reduction and *potential* benefit from lower floating-rate debt interest costs [cite: 5, 4 (in step 1)]. |
| **Cash Tax Rate** | Low | 4.0% of EBT | 4.0% of EBT | **Management Guidance:** Use the high end of management's guided 3%-4% of EBITDA (or EBT) cash tax reduction due to favorable law changes [cite: 4 (in step 1)]. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | Negative | 3.0% | 3.0% | **Conservative Positive Rate:** Past ROIC is negative due to historical net losses. A conservative, reasonable positive ROIC of **3.0%** is applied to *retained cash* to generate additional income, per instructions, since the business is now stabilizing and debt is being addressed. |

### B. Projected Net Income and Cash Flow Calculation

**Rule Implementation:** Net Income for next year = (Net Income from ops) + (ROIC on previous year's retained cash).

| Metric (in millions) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | \$11,579 | \$12,329 | \$12,851 | \$13,202 | \$13,570 | \$13,959 |
| **EBITDA** (34.0%/35.0% Margin) | \$3,937 | \$4,192 | \$4,370 | \$4,621 | \$4,750 | \$4,886 |
| **D&A** | (\$1,350) | (\$1,350) | (\$1,350) | (\$1,400) | (\$1,400) | (\$1,400) |

| **Taxes** (4.0%) | (\$69) | (\$81) | (\$89) | (\$97) | (\$103) | (\$109) |
| **Base Net Income (A)** | **\$1,668** | **\$1,936** | **\$2,131** | **\$2,324** | **\$2,472** | **\$2,627** |
| **ROIC on Retained Cash (B)** | \$0 | \$50 | \$59 | \$65 | \$72 | \$77 |
| **Total Net Income (A+B)** | **\$1,668** | **\$1,986** | **\$2,190** | **\$2,389** | **\$2,544** | **\$2,704** |
| **Retained Cash (Cummulative)** | \$1,668 | \$3,654 | \$5,844 | \$8,233 | \$10,777 | \$13,481 |
| **ROIC Calculation (3.0%)** | | 3.0% on \$1,668 | 3.0% on \$1,986 + 1,668 = \$3,654... |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Terminal Value Calculation

*   **Final Cash Flow Year (2030) Net Income:** \$2,704 million
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** 1.0% (Assuming long-term growth slightly above US GDP/Inflation)
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC - r):** 8.0% (Reflects a levered business with moderate risk)

$$
\text{Terminal Value (TV)} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g}
$$

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$2,704 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.08 - 0.01} = \frac{\$2,731}{0.07} = \$39,014 \text{ million}
$$

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Discount Factor is calculated as $1 / (1 + WACC)^{\text{Year}}$. The Present Value (PV) of Net Income is the PV of future cash flows.

| Year | Net Income (CF) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value of CF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$1,668 | 0.9259 | \$1,544 |
| **2026** | \$1,986 | 0.8573 | \$1,703 |
| **2027** | \$2,190 | 0.7938 | \$1,738 |
| **2028** | \$2,389 | 0.7350 | \$1,756 |
| **2029** | \$2,544 | 0.6806 | \$1,731 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | \$2,704 | 0.6302 | \$1,704 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | \$39,014 | 0.6302 | \$24,587 |
| | | **Total NPV** | **\$34,763 million** |

## Conclusion and Justification of Disparity

### Fair Value of CZR Stock: **\$116.11 per share**

### Justification of Market Disparity

The calculated fair value of **\$116.11** is significantly higher than the approximate current market price of around \$20.59. This disparity suggests the market is not fully pricing in the management's guidance and the full operating leverage potential of the combined entity.

The key differences in assumptions are:

1.  **Confidence in Digital Segment Profitability:** The valuation hinges heavily on the Digital segment achieving and expanding on management's **\$500 million+ EBITDA target by 2026**. The market likely maintains a heavy discount due to:
    *   **Execution Risk:** Doubts about CZR's ability to transition from high-growth, high-loss to high-margin profitability in the hyper-competitive online sports betting and iGaming space. The market may be projecting a lower terminal margin or higher ongoing customer acquisition cost.
    *   **High Revenue Growth:** The model requires a 72% compounded revenue growth for Digital from 2024 to 2026 to hit the EBITDA target, which is very aggressive.

2.  **High Debt and Interest Burden:** The market is deeply concerned with CZR's massive debt load (\$11.9 billion). While the DCF model calculates the **Equity** value after subtracting debt, the market price (a reflection of equity value) is continuously suppressed by the perceived risk of this high leverage, especially in a rising interest rate or weakening consumer discretionary spending environment. The current negative Net Income also pushes down market sentiment.

3.  **Conservative DCF Model vs. Market Sentiment:**
    *   The model assumes all net income is converted to cash and reinvested to generate a positive **3.0% ROIC**, leading to substantial compounding of value. The market, seeing historical negative net income and continued CapEx needs for a casino business, is likely projecting zero or near-zero retained cash flow for equity holders for the next several years.
    *   The use of a **1.0% Perpetual Growth Rate** in the Terminal Value calculation, while conservative for a DCF, is being applied to a very high projected 2030 Free Cash Flow (Net Income of \$2.7 billion), leading to a high terminal value (\$39 billion). The market is likely pricing in a higher risk/lower growth scenario for the mature combined entity.

**Conclusion:** The DCF valuation of \$116.11 reflects a scenario where **Caesars successfully executes its stated Digital profitability targets and continues its disciplined debt reduction to deleverage the balance sheet**, unlocking the full cash flow potential of its large, stable brick-and-mortar portfolio. The market's current price of ~ **\$20.59** indicates a deep skepticism on the execution of the Digital turnaround and a persistent fear of the leverage and its drag on true free cash flow generation for shareholders. The \$116.11 is the theoretical value *if* management's vision for deleveraging and Digital segment's profitability is fully realized.
