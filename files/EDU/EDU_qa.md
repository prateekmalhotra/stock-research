## Business Summary

New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. provides educational services primarily to students and adults across China. Following significant regulatory changes, the company shifted its focus from core academic K-9 tutoring to offering non-academic training, test preparation for overseas study, and specialized vocational courses for adults. A major component of its current revenue now comes from its popular e-commerce live-streaming platform, East Buy, where the company leverages its teaching talent to sell products. The company earns revenue mainly through tuition fees for its diversified courses and commissions from product sales on its streaming platform.

---

## Business Model Risk

The greatest risk is the continuous threat of unexpected policy changes from the Chinese government, which has historically caused massive disruption; for example, the 2021 ban on for-profit tutoring instantly eliminated the company's core business. Near-term risks involve sustaining the momentum of their new ventures, such as the East Buy e-commerce platform, which must compete fiercely in a volatile live-streaming market. Long-term risks include potential regulatory creep, where the government might expand restrictions to cover high school, overseas, or vocational training, or place new limitations on large technology and streaming businesses, directly harming the sustainability of their diversified revenue sources.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU), presented in simple, jargon-free English.

### The Inception: Why the Business Was Founded

1.  **Founding and Founder:** New Oriental was established in Beijing, China, on November 16, 1993, by **Michael Yu Minhong** (also known as Yu Minhong). Prior to starting the company, he was an English instructor at Peking University.
2.  **The Initial Goal:** The primary motivation was to help young Chinese students realize their "American Dream" by providing preparatory courses for critical tests like the **TOEFL** and **GRE**, which are required for admission to Western universities. This filled a huge demand for international education as China opened up to the world.
3.  **Unique Teaching Style:** The company's initial success was built on its founder's vision for an innovative and inspirational teaching style. Instructors combined humor and interactive techniques with traditional Chinese educational values to make test prep engaging.

***

### The Era of Growth: Riding the Tailwinds

4.  **Major Tailwind (1990s-2010s):** New Oriental rode the massive "tailwinds" of China's economic boom and the national desire for a better life through education. As China's middle class grew, parents invested heavily in their children’s academic future, both at home and abroad.
5.  **Rapid Expansion:** The company quickly expanded its offerings far beyond just overseas test preparation. It diversified into English language training, K-12 after-school tutoring (for kindergarten through 12th grade), and preschool education, becoming a dominant national player.
6.  **Public Listing and Capital:** A key milestone was its Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** in 2006, making it the first Chinese private education firm to do so. This infusion of capital fueled its expansion across China, where it built a large network of schools and learning centers. By 2017, the company had a market value exceeding $10 billion US dollars, signifying its status as an education giant.

***

### The Major Headwind and Crisis

7.  **The Overwhelming Headwind (2021):** The biggest problem the company ever faced was the Chinese government's "Double Reduction" policy, implemented in July 2021. This unexpected and strict regulation was intended to reduce the academic pressure and financial burden on students and parents.
8.  **The Core Business Shutdown:** The policy essentially **banned for-profit academic tutoring** for students in the compulsory school years (K-9). Since this K-12 tutoring business was a core source of income, New Oriental's market value plummeted by about 90% overnight, a massive crisis that caused its total revenue to fall sharply.
9.  **Massive Layoffs:** Dealing with this crisis meant an immediate and drastic downsizing. The company was forced to dismiss approximately 60,000 employees and close many of its learning centers.

***

### Innovative Solutions and the Pivot to Present Day

10. **The Strategic Restructuring:** Facing the possibility of bankruptcy, New Oriental demonstrated remarkable resilience by immediately changing its business structure. It cancelled its for-profit academic tutoring and focused on areas not affected by the regulation.
11. **New Educational Focus:** The company swiftly shifted its education offerings to:
    *   **Non-Academic Education:** This includes new classes focusing on "quality-oriented" subjects like musical instruments, art, and physical training.
    *   **College and Overseas Education:** It maintained and continued its original test preparation, language training, and consulting services for university students and those looking to study abroad.
    *   **Vocational and Family Education:** It also expanded services in vocational training and educational content for parents.
12. **The E-Commerce Innovation:** The most notable and successful solution was entering the **live-streaming e-commerce market**. The company launched the platform "Oriental Select" (later its subsidiary was renamed East Buy).
13. **Unique Selling Proposition:** Oriental Select became a sensation by using its laid-off teachers—known for their eloquence and broad knowledge—to sell agricultural products and books. These teachers would sell items using a unique **bilingual (English and Chinese) and educational approach**, a refreshing and entertaining style that quickly attracted millions of followers and generated significant sales, helping to stabilize the company's finances.
14. **The Company Today:** New Oriental has completed a successful transformation, moving from being primarily a K-12 academic tutoring provider to a diverse "education for a lifetime" provider, spanning non-academic tutoring, college/overseas preparation, and a successful live-streaming e-commerce business. Its goal remains providing high-quality educational services and products to meet the evolving needs of Chinese families across different life stages.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) is less about a single, protected technology and more about a powerful, long-standing brand and an unparalleled ability to execute a radical business model transformation in the face of an existential regulatory crisis.

### I. The Core of New Oriental's Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Iconic Brand Recognition and Trust:** New Oriental has built a highly recognized and trusted brand over three decades in China’s private education sector. This deep, generational trust from a massive, loyal client base is a crucial asset that survived the 2021 regulatory crackdown and is difficult for new competitors to replicate.
2.  **Unmatched Resilience and Adaptability:** The company’s successful pivot after the 2021 "Double Reduction Policy"—which banned its primary K-9 academic tutoring business—is its defining differentiator. While many rivals collapsed, New Oriental rapidly shifted resources to non-academic tutoring, overseas test preparation, and the innovative live-streaming e-commerce platform, **East Buy (Koolearn)**, proving exceptional operational and strategic agility.
3.  **Diversified Revenue Ecosystem:** Unlike former competitors who relied almost entirely on K-12 academic tutoring, New Oriental’s current model is diversified across non-academic training, intelligent learning systems/devices, overseas test prep, consulting, and its highly successful e-commerce business. This reduces regulatory and market concentration risk.
4.  **Strategic Differentiation (East Buy):** The live-streaming e-commerce arm, East Buy, which utilizes former teachers as hosts to sell products by combining knowledge and storytelling, is a unique and powerful growth engine that leverages the core competency (teaching talent) and credibility of the New Oriental brand in a non-educational market.

### II. Market Position and Pricing Power

5.  **Enhanced Competitive Position and Pricing Power:** The regulatory ban eliminated many aggressive, venture-capital-backed ed-tech companies who were undercutting prices to gain market share. This sharp reduction in competition allowed surviving leaders like New Oriental to strengthen their competitive position and improve pricing power in their remaining and new education segments.
6.  **Dominance in Specialized Niches:** New Oriental maintains a leading position in specific, less-regulated areas like **Overseas Test Preparation** (e.g., TOEFL, IELTS, GRE) and **Overseas Study Consulting**. This is a high-value niche with high barriers to entry due to the need for specialized knowledge, international reputation, and deep historical expertise.

### III. Customer Stickiness and Network Effects

7.  **High Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue Potential:** The company serves a wide "education for a lifetime" range, from pre-school to adult test prep and vocational training. This allows for a sticky, long-term relationship where a customer using an elementary English program might later use their overseas test prep, and a family using a non-academic course might also purchase educational devices.
8.  **Internal Network Effects from Talent and Brand:** While not a typical tech network effect, the company benefits from a "Talent Network." Its large, reputable pool of educators is a significant draw, and the success of former teachers (like on East Buy) only reinforces the brand's quality reputation, creating a virtuous cycle that attracts both top teaching talent and more students.
9.  **Network Effect from a Large Customer Pool:** The enormous, accumulated base of past and present students (over 26.6 million enrollments as of 2016, and over 7.4 million student enrollments in FY2024) forms a massive, low-cost marketing and referral engine for its new product lines, including educational tours and intelligent learning systems.

### IV. Vulnerability and Moat Reinforcement

10. **High Barrier to Displacement by Capital:** The regulatory environment itself acts as the primary barrier to displacement, even by a player with more capital. The "Double Reduction" policy bans new for-profit registrations in the former core K-9 academic space and strictly limits capital-raising/foreign investment, rendering the "cash-burning" model of aggressive expansion ineffective.
11. **Continuous Innovation and R&D Investment:** New Oriental is actively investing in technology, including the integration of **AI and data analytics** into its curriculum to create personalized learning experiences. It also invests in the broader education ecosystem through the **EDU Fund**, which focuses on innovative startups. This investment ensures the company's educational delivery remains at the cutting edge and helps maintain its market edge.
12. **Past/Current Action for Moat Creation:** The past action was pioneering the industry and building the brand over 30 years. The current action is the bold, successful pivot into non-academic subjects and live-streaming e-commerce, creating new, high-growth revenue streams that leverage the brand name to sell products and services beyond traditional schooling.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of public filings, including information typically found in a Form 20-F (the equivalent of a DEF 14A for foreign private issuers), the following points summarize the management incentive and compensation structure for New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership (Alignment with Shareholders)**

*   **High Founder Ownership:** The company's founder and chairman, Mr. Michael Minhong Yu, holds a significant beneficial ownership of the company's total outstanding common shares.
*   **Direct Shareholder Alignment:** As of September 15, 2023, Mr. Yu's beneficial ownership, held through his private company, was reported to be **12.2%** of the total outstanding common shares. This substantial personal stake is a strong indicator that his long-term financial interest is directly tied to the overall performance and stock price appreciation for all shareholders.
*   **Conclusion on Ownership:** This high level of ownership by the founder aligns his decision-making with maximizing long-term shareholder value, suggesting a strong incentive to act in the interest of the owners of the company.

#### **2. Compensation Structure (Use of Incentives)**

*   **Equity-Based Compensation:** The company's annual reports on Form 20-F, which cover executive compensation, confirm the use of **share-based compensation** (stock incentives) for directors and executive officers.
*   **Incentive for Long-Term Value:** The presence of equity compensation is a standard mechanism for public companies to create a direct link between management's remuneration and the company's stock performance over a multi-year vesting period.
*   **Variable Pay Structure (Inferred):** While the precise mix (salary vs. bonus vs. equity) is not publicly disclosed in the search snippets, the confirmed use of share incentives suggests the compensation model is structured to include both fixed and variable (at-risk) pay components, which rewards performance that drives the stock price higher.

#### **3. Conclusion on Incentives and Shareholder Interest**

*   **Strong Incentive for Shareholder Value:** The combination of the founder's very high personal equity stake and the confirmed practice of granting equity-based compensation to management indicates a powerful alignment of executive interests with those of the common shareholders.
*   **Mitigation of Self-Serving Behavior:** The significant percentage of stock ownership by the most senior executive acts as a deterrent against short-term, self-serving decisions, as such actions would directly and negatively impact a substantial portion of the executive's personal wealth.
*   **Final Assessment:** Management is primarily incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders, driven both by the founder's direct financial ownership and the industry-standard inclusion of long-term, equity-based incentives in the overall compensation structure.

## Price History

Based on recent data and price history analysis for New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU), here is a summary of its performance and key drivers.

### Price History and Technical Analysis Summary

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) has a 52-week low of approximately $40.66. Using a recent closing price of around $54.45, the stock is currently trading approximately **33.91%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Trading Low Based on Technicals:** Technical indicators present a mixed picture:
    *   Some analyses suggest the stock is **not trading low** on a longer-term basis, as its current price of ~$59.57 is significantly above both its 50-day (~$53.34) and 200-day (~$49.64) simple moving averages, which are often considered "Buy" signals.
    *   Conversely, for a price of ~$54.45, the stock finds support close to that level (~$54.36), and some short-term moving averages, like the 50-day MA (~$57.91), suggest it is currently below that benchmark, indicating a **short-term downtrend or consolidation.**
    *   A 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) as low as 26.926 has been noted, which technically suggests the stock is **oversold**, a condition that can sometimes signal that a stock is trading low and may be due for a bounce.

### Significant Price Movements and Drivers

3.  **Recent Price Rallies (Up Bigly):** The stock has experienced a significant rally in the last few months, driven by several positive developments:
    *   **Analyst Upgrades:** The stock surged over **13%** in a single day in June 2025 following a J.P. Morgan upgrade to an "Overweight" rating, citing attractive valuation after a sustained sell-off and improved fiscal prospects.
    *   **Strong Earnings and Buybacks:** The Q4 FY2025 earnings report soundly beat expectations and coincided with a new rally. The company also committed to dedicating about half of its GAAP net income to stock buybacks and/or dividends, which is a strong signal of capital return to shareholders.
    *   **Enrollment and Repurchase Programs:** In October 2025, the stock was up nearly 10% after Bank of America raised its price target, alongside news of a new share repurchase program and soaring enrollment figures (an 82% jump at its Ikon Institute).

4.  **Significant Drops:** In the first half of fiscal year 2025, the stock saw a substantial decline.
    *   **Earnings Misses:** The two earnings reports prior to the strong Q4 FY2025 report were not well-received, as the company badly missed consensus estimates for net income.
    *   **Major Sell-off:** The Q2 FY2025 earnings report, in particular, triggered a **23.2% drop** in the stock in January 2025, which began the significant sell-off period.

## Long Thesis

New Oriental represents a compelling turnaround story, having successfully navigated an existential regulatory crisis by becoming a more resilient and diversified company. The bull case rests on two pillars: First, dominating the safe, less-regulated educational niches, specifically overseas test preparation, adult and university student training, and high-quality, non-academic (like art and music) courses. Second, capitalizing on the highly profitable, high-growth e-commerce venture, East Buy, which successfully leverages the company's famous teaching talent and deep brand trust to sell products through engaging live streams. In the near term, the focus on cost efficiency and market consolidation (fewer competitors) should continue to boost profit margins. In the long term, this diversified ecosystem shields the company from the regulatory risks that destroyed its old business, ensuring sustained, profitable growth. Furthermore, management's new commitment to returning at least 50% of net income to shareholders (via buybacks/dividends starting FY2026) offers a strong foundation for investor confidence and stock value appreciation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several key factors: 1) The Chinese government must maintain regulatory stability, meaning no new sweeping bans are applied to the remaining educational businesses (like overseas test prep or vocational training) or to the live-streaming e-commerce sector. 2) The East Buy e-commerce platform must maintain its unique appeal and market momentum despite intense competition from established tech giants. 3) Management must successfully execute its physical expansion plans by adding new learning centers only in profitable areas and effectively integrating new technologies (like AI) without sacrificing its focus on cost control and operational efficiency.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

## Bear Case Critique & Flaws in the Long Thesis for New Oriental Education (EDU)

The bull thesis oversimplifies the "resilience" and "diversification" by understating significant, persistent macroeconomic, competitive, and operational risks. The assumption of sustained, profitable growth is contradicted by recent trends showing material deceleration in key segments and pressure on margins.

### Flaws and Holes in the Long Thesis:

1.  **"Shielded... from the regulatory risks" is an overstatement.** While the new focus areas are less-regulated than K-9 tutoring, the overseas test preparation and study consulting segment remains vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, specifically Sino-US relations, which management has cited as an ongoing risk. Furthermore, non-academic and foreign-funded language training are still subject to new or revised regulations by Chinese authorities, meaning the risk is managed, not eliminated.

2.  **Core Educational Segments Show Deceleration, Not "Dominating" Growth.** The growth rate for key new educational businesses (like non-academic tutoring) has slowed notably, dropping from over 30% to the mid-teens in recent reporting periods. Furthermore, overseas test preparation and consulting revenues have shown very slow growth (as low as 1-2% YoY) in a recent quarter, suggesting the idea of "dominating" these niches is a significant stretch.

3.  **High Key-Man Risk and Slowing Momentum for East Buy.** The highly profitable e-commerce venture, East Buy, relies heavily on its unique appeal tied to famous teacher-streamers, which introduces significant **key-man risk** and brand volatility, as demonstrated by a recent public controversy involving a star live-streamer. The rapid growth phase for this platform is also projected to slow down as the mature live-streaming e-commerce market intensifies with competition from established tech giants.

4.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds Threaten "Discretionary" Revenue.** The core educational businesses, including overseas test prep and non-academic courses, are highly sensitive to Chinese family discretionary spending. The current weak macroeconomic environment in China, marked by low consumer confidence and diminishing wealth effects, is directly pressuring the demand and pricing power of EDU’s services.

5.  **Profitability and Margin Improvement is Not Guaranteed.** The assumption that cost efficiency will "continue to boost profit margins" is challenged by recent financial results, which show operating costs and expenses increasing and, in some periods, net income declining year-over-year despite overall revenue growth. This suggests the costs associated with physical expansion, marketing, and integrating new technologies like AI are offsetting operational efficiencies.

### Bear Case Thesis

The market is overly optimistic about New Oriental's turnaround story, which is highly reliant on two slowing growth engines operating in high-risk environments.

1.  **Slowing Core Business & Margin Pressure:** The educational business is not achieving the "dominating" growth required to offset the initial loss of K-9 revenue, with overseas test prep and non-academic training growth rates decelerating significantly and showing vulnerability to China's weak macroeconomic environment and families cutting discretionary spending.
2.  **Key-Man Risk and E-commerce Maturity:** The e-commerce venture, East Buy, faces inevitable growth deceleration as the live-streaming market matures and is highly exposed to the risk of losing a star streamer, which could instantly and materially impact revenue and brand trust.
3.  **Unquantifiable Regulatory Overhead:** Despite shifting to "safer" sectors, geopolitical tensions continue to cloud the overseas business, and any future, unforeseen regulatory action on the live-streaming sector or non-academic tutoring would erase the assumption of long-term stability. The high costs of new capacity expansion and AI integration are offsetting expected margin boosts, leading to tepid profit growth and a less compelling "profitable growth" narrative than anticipated.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis and the results from the initial search, the core of the Long vs. Bear debate (i.e., the health of the East Buy e-commerce segment and the true profitability of the core educational business) is still not fully resolved.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps for further investigation:

### I. Financial & Profitability Clarity (Resolving the Long vs. Bear Debate)

1.  **East Buy Financial Performance:** Directly investigate the latest revenue and profit contribution of the East Buy segment (East Buy Holding Limited, stock code 1797.HK). The Q4 results imply its growth is lower than the core education business, but the exact figures are missing and crucial to confirming the bear case point on deceleration.
2.  **Shareholder Return Basis (GAAP vs. Non-GAAP):** Clarify the exact definition of "net income" that management is using for its new three-year shareholder return plan (50% returned starting FY2026). Given the vast difference in Q4 FY2025 between GAAP Net Income ($7.1M) and Non-GAAP Net Income ($98.1M), this distinction is vital for accurately valuing the promised capital return.
3.  **Core Educational Profitability vs. Expansion Cost:** Seek out management commentary or analyst estimates on the current operating margin for the *core educational business only* (excluding East Buy). The educational segment's 18.7% growth is positive, but the overall operating expenses increased 11.2% in Q4 FY2025, suggesting a squeeze from new learning center expansion and AI investment, which warrants a deeper look into cost control success.

### II. East Buy: Key-Man Risk & Competition

4.  **Key Streamer Status & Content Innovation:** Investigate the latest news regarding New Oriental's famous teacher-streamers, especially given the key-man risk cited in the bear case. Are there new, large-scale streamers emerging, or is the platform's momentum still tied to the original few? This addresses the brand volatility risk.
5.  **Competitive Threat in Live-Streaming:** Search for recent analyses on East Buy's current market share and competitive position against giants like ByteDance (Douyin/TikTok) and Alibaba (Taobao) in the high-end e-commerce live-streaming space. This is critical to assessing the long-term moat of this new business segment.

### III. Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Risks

6.  **Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Impact:** Look for recent management or analyst commentary specifically addressing the impact of Sino-US relations (i.e., visa restrictions, overseas sentiment) and the domestic Chinese consumer slowdown on the high-margin Overseas Test Preparation and Consulting business. This would provide color on the risk cited in the bear thesis.
7.  **Institutional Ownership Trends:** Perform a more specific search for recent institutional ownership data (e.g., 13F filings summary). Identifying which major funds have significantly increased or decreased their stake in EDU over the last quarter can signal whether professional investors are buying into the recovery or selling on deceleration fears.
