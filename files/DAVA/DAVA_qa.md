## Business Summary

Endava operates as a global technology services company that helps large organizations modernize their entire digital setup. It is a strictly Business-to-Business (B2B) model, selling expertise rather than proprietary software. Its customers are primarily large companies in North America and Europe, heavily concentrated in high-value sectors such as banking, payments, media, and technology. Endava generates revenue by providing expert teams (consultants, designers, and software developers) who build new applications, move client data to the cloud, and automate processes. The company mainly uses a 'nearshore' model, where experts work closely with the client from specialized delivery centers located in regions like Eastern Europe and Latin America. This strategy allows Endava to offer high-quality technical skills at a competitive cost compared to using only local teams in high-cost areas.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is client spending reduction. Since Endava’s projects are often large, discretionary investments in technology, if economic uncertainty occurs, clients (especially financial firms) often immediately cut or delay these projects, which directly reduces Endava’s revenue. This type of spending slowdown was noted in 2023 following global interest rate hikes, highlighting the immediate sensitivity to economic cycles. Long-term risks include intense competition for highly skilled technical talent; Endava must constantly win the global 'war for talent' against much larger service providers and specialized tech firms, otherwise wage inflation will erode their profit margins and delivery capabilities. Furthermore, since Endava relies heavily on specific regional delivery centers (many in Eastern Europe), geopolitical instability or conflict in these regions could severely disrupt their workforce, operational capacity, and ability to fulfill client contracts, jeopardizing the competitive advantage provided by their specialized delivery model.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain Endava plc (DAVA), a company that specializes in helping large businesses update their technology and adapt to the digital age.

### The History of Endava plc (DAVA)

#### **1. The Inception (2000) and Why It Was Founded**

1.  **A Dual Beginning:** Endava was founded in 2000, not as a single company, but through the combination of two separate firms: Concise, which was based in London, UK, and Compudava, which was located in Chișinău, Moldova.
2.  **The Founding Purpose:** The founders saw a growing gap between traditional large businesses and the rapidly changing digital world of the early 2000s.
3.  **The Goal:** The business was established to offer specialized IT services and outsourced software development, providing companies with a more cost-effective way to build and improve their digital capabilities.
4.  **Core Mission:** Endava’s ultimate goal is to help its clients become "digital, experience-driven businesses" by providing the full journey of services, from the initial idea right through to launching the final product.

#### **2. Core Innovative Solutions and Business Model**

1.  **The Key Solution: The TEAM Framework:** Endava developed a unique, proprietary method for working with clients called "The Endava Adaptive Model," or TEAM.
2.  **Agile and Quick Delivery:** This method uses "Distributed Enterprise Agile" at scale, which is essentially a way of working in small, flexible, and integrated teams that can quickly develop, test, and adapt software solutions.
3.  **Ideation to Production:** Their process, which they call "Ideation to Production," means they work closely with clients to refine a rough idea, design the user experience, develop the robust engineering, and launch it quickly, allowing for early measurement and adjustment.
4.  **Multidisciplinary Teams:** The company deliberately combines people with different skills—creativity, deep industry knowledge, and top-tier engineering—into single teams to ensure the final product is both innovative and technically sound.
5.  **Strategic Expansion:** Over the years, Endava expanded its services from basic software development to include complex areas like cloud services, data analysis, user experience design, and automation, keeping pace with the changing needs of its clients.

#### **3. Tailwinds (Favorable Market Trends) That Helped Endava Grow**

1.  **The Digital Transformation Boom:** The biggest tailwind was the massive, long-term trend of all major industries—like finance, media, and retail—needing to replace old systems and create new digital products to survive and compete.
2.  **Global Scale and "Nearshore" Model:** Endava strategically built its delivery centers in Eastern Europe (like Romania and Moldova) and later in Latin America. This "nearshore" model gave them access to highly skilled engineers at a competitive cost while keeping them in similar time zones and with high cultural affinity to their primary clients in the UK, Europe, and North America.
3.  **Public Market Access:** The company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2018 under the ticker DAVA provided a significant infusion of capital and increased its profile, allowing it to make larger strategic acquisitions.

#### **4. Headwinds (Problems) and How They Were Dealt With**

1.  **Recalibration of Client Spending (The Headwind):** In recent years (FY2024), Endava faced a major headwind due to global economic uncertainty and a slowdown, which led many large clients to pause or cut back their spending on discretionary technology projects.
    *   **The Reaction:** This market pressure caused the company's revenue growth to slow, prompting the CEO to acknowledge "significant headwinds" across the business.
2.  **Integration of Acquisitions (The Problem):** As the company grew through acquiring smaller firms (like Velocity Partners and Levvel LLC), they discovered that integrating the culture and operations of these new businesses was "far more complicated" than expected, leading to staff turnover and internal friction.
    *   **The Solution:** Endava addressed this by implementing formal internal programs, sometimes involving external consultants, to quickly integrate the leadership teams and ensure cultural alignment, which helped them retain key staff and successfully merge operations.
3.  **Geopolitical and Currency Risk (The Headwind):** Operating globally exposes Endava to challenges like foreign currency fluctuations and political instability, particularly in regions where it has significant operational hubs, such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which adds complexity to its international operations.
    *   **The Management:** The company continuously monitors these risks and structures its financials to manage the impact of currency swings and economic instability, such as hyperinflation in countries like Argentina.

#### **5. Present Day Focus and Future Goal**

1.  **The Next Digital Shift (AI-Native Approach):** Endava’s current strategy is focused on the next major market trend: Artificial Intelligence. They are shifting their delivery model to be "AI-native," meaning they embed AI capabilities into every aspect of their services.
2.  **Fostering External Innovation (Dava.Rise):** To stay ahead, Endava launched the Dava.Rise program, which acts as a bridge to connect large corporate clients with high-potential tech startups. This allows their enterprise customers to quickly adopt new and transformative technologies from the startup ecosystem.
3.  **The Enduring Goal:** Endava's consistent goal remains to be the leading partner for enterprises that need to transform, combining deep industry knowledge, world-class engineering, and a focus on user experience to create smart, engaging, and efficient businesses.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," for Endava plc (DAVA) is less about a patent-protected product and more about a combination of its delivery model, specialized talent, deep integration with client systems, and a high-touch consulting approach.

### Moat and Differentiation from Competitors

1.  **Specialized Focus on Complex Digital Transformation:** Endava differentiates itself by focusing on "next-generation technology services" and complex digital transformation, rather than general, lower-margin legacy IT maintenance. This high-margin focus, particularly in sectors like Financial Services, TMT (Technology, Media, Telecom), and Healthcare, allows them to command superior margins compared to some traditional IT services peers.

2.  **Unique Delivery Model (Nearshore/Distributed Agile):** The company leverages a "nearshore" and remote-first delivery model, utilizing a highly skilled workforce, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. This model balances technical quality with cost efficiency, giving them a structural talent and cost advantage over purely onshore or far-shore-focused rivals.

3.  **Proprietary Technology and AI-Native Approach:** Endava invests in its own internal accelerators and frameworks, such as the Endava Digital Platform (EDP), a low-code platform, and specialized AI solutions like Morpheus for the pharmaceutical vertical. This proprietary technology creates efficiencies and offers a unique value proposition for client projects.

### Special Position and Pricing Power

1.  **Pricing Power from Embedded Consulting:** The firm acts as a long-term strategic partner, embedding its teams and expertise directly into the client's core business and technology systems. This deep, consultative relationship, particularly in critical areas like payments and core system re-engineering, allows for better pricing power than commodity IT services.

2.  **Special Position in Financial Services:** Endava has a strong historical presence and deep industry expertise in the Payments and Financial Services verticals. This specialization creates a defensible niche, as regulatory and domain knowledge in finance is a significant barrier to entry for generalist competitors.

### Customer and Contract Stickiness

1.  **High Switching Costs and Long-Term Relationships:** Customers face high switching costs—the time, effort, risk, and technical difficulty of moving a complex, deeply integrated digital transformation project to a new vendor. This lock-in effect is a powerful moat.

2.  **Sticky and Recurring Revenue:** Endava's business model is explicitly built around long-term engagements, with an average client relationship duration of 5.7 years and a high client retention rate (around 92%). This is further evidenced by approximately 78% of their business being repeat business, indicating that contracts are sticky and recurring, rather than one-time projects.

### Reason for Growth and Moat Creation

1.  **Rapid Growth from Digital Acceleration:** The company’s growth (with a 35% CAGR over a decade) was primarily driven by its early focus on the wave of digital transformation, cloud adoption, and frictionless payments. It rode the industry tailwind by positioning itself as an expert in these high-growth, strategic areas.

2.  **Strategic M&A and Geographic Expansion:** Endava aggressively built out its capabilities and geographic footprint through bolt-on acquisitions and international expansion, particularly in the highly lucrative North American market, thereby scaling its specialized expertise.

3.  **Talent Moat via Endava University:** To ensure a constant supply of high-quality talent, the company invests in its own internal upskilling program, "Endava University." This helps create a talent moat by guaranteeing a pool of engineers with cutting-edge skills, which is crucial for its "next-generation" service promise.

### Displacement Risk, Innovation, and R&D

1.  **Vulnerability to Capital:** Endava operates in a highly competitive and crowded market against global consulting and IT giants (like Accenture and Cognizant) which have far more capital and scale. The services-based nature of the business means it is easier to displace than a business with a hard technology moat, and some analysts suggest it lacks a deep economic moat.

2.  **Counter-Advantage of Agility:** Endava's mid-size scale is sometimes viewed by management as an advantage, allowing the firm to remain more nimble and agile than its largest competitors, enabling faster pivots to new technologies like AI.

3.  **Necessity for Constant Innovation:** The company's core value proposition rests on providing "next-generation technology services." This mandates a need to constantly innovate and re-skill its workforce to maintain its competitive edge. Endava addresses this need through internal development (R&D is an ongoing expense) and external initiatives like **Dava.Rise**, a program to connect scale-ups with enterprises to accelerate innovation.

## Catalyst Analysis

Endava plc (DAVA) is a technology-driven business transformation group. The catalysts for its stock price in the near and long term are primarily related to the successful execution of its strategy to navigate a challenging market for IT services, particularly through its focus on next-generation technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and securing large, strategic client deals.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Conversion of Large Strategic Deals:** Endava's management explicitly mentioned three large signed engagements that are expected to underpin a projected revenue increase in the second half of fiscal year 2026, which should boost investor confidence.
2.  **Increased Client Spending and Order Book Conversion:** A turnaround in current volatile client spending, specifically converting the "highest-ever quarterly order book" reported in Q4 FY2025 into recognized revenue, would signal improving business conditions.
3.  **Share Repurchase Program:** The ongoing share repurchase program, with a remaining authorization of $34.1 million as of October 2025, acts as a near-term support for the stock price by reducing the outstanding share count.
4.  **Successful Integration of AI Initiatives:** The company's immediate focus on its "AI-native approach" and internal productivity gains from AI could lead to better margins and more competitive service offerings sooner than expected.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)

1.  **AI-Native Transformation Leadership:** The formation of a Global Advisory Board to drive AI-powered business outcomes and the expansion of the "Dava.X" platform positions Endava for long-term growth as AI spending increases globally.
2.  **Core Modernization and Digital Shift:** The company's long-term strategy focuses on its deep industry expertise in areas like payments and finance, combined with core modernization and cloud capabilities, addressing a massive, multi-year trend in enterprise IT spending.
3.  **Expansion through Innovation Ecosystem (Dava.Rise):** The launch of "Dava.Rise" to connect scale-ups with global enterprises is a strategic move by management to integrate cutting-edge innovation, ensuring a pipeline of next-generation solutions for its client base.
4.  **Strengthening Strategic Partnerships:** Securing more multi-year, large payments deals, following the example of the potential $100 million deal closed in Q1 FY2026, would validate the strategy of becoming an AI-native, technology-agnostic transformation partner.

### Management Commentary on Strategy and Catalysts (from recent earnings calls)

*   **Focus on Strategic Deals:** CEO John Cotterell highlighted that the company is specifically targeting and winning large, multi-year, and transformational deals, citing a significant new payments deal as a prime example of their targeted business.
*   **AI as Core to Transformation:** Management's strategy is centered on an "AI-native approach," believing that embedding AI into their operations and client solutions will be the core driver of growth and competitive advantage.
*   **Outlook Cautious but Targeted:** While revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2026 was lowered due to macroeconomic volatility and a one-time client issue, management maintains that new strategic engagements will drive an uplift in the second half.
*   **Commitment to Capital Allocation:** The company has reaffirmed its commitment to its share repurchase program, indicating a belief that the stock is undervalued and using cash flow to directly benefit shareholders.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Endava plc's (DAVA) Form 20-F and related reports, here is an analysis of its management incentive and compensation structure.

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis

**1. Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

*   **High CEO Ownership:** The CEO, John Cotterell, directly holds a very significant 16.33% of the company's shares, demonstrating a high level of personal and financial alignment with shareholder interests.
*   **Shareholding Requirements:** Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding equivalent to **300% of their base salary** within five years of their appointment, which is a stringent requirement to ensure long-term focus.
*   **Non-Executive Director (NED) Ownership:** Non-Executive Directors are also required to hold a shareholding equivalent to **$300,000** in value, further aligning the board's interests with those of public shareholders.

**2. Compensation Structure**

*   **Mix of Pay:** The CEO's total yearly compensation has a strong incentive component, with approximately 53.5% as salary and 46.5% comprised of bonuses, including company stock and options.
*   **Performance-Based Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** Executive directors receive long-term Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the Equity Incentive Plan (EIP), which typically vest over a three-year period.
*   **LTI Performance Metrics:** The vesting of LTI PSUs is explicitly tied to a combination of multi-year financial and shareholder metrics, including **three-year revenue**, **Adjusted Profit Before Tax (PBT) Margin**, and **relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**.
*   **Short-Term Incentives (STI):** Annual cash bonuses are also performance-driven, being subject to an **Adjusted PBT performance measure**, with no payout unless a threshold level of performance is met.

**3. Conclusion on Management Incentive and Alignment**

*   **Strong Alignment with Shareholders:** The combination of the CEO's exceptionally high direct ownership (16.33%) and the formal, rigorous shareholding requirement (300% of salary for Executive Directors) creates a powerful incentive for management to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders.
*   **Focus on Long-Term Value:** The long-term incentive plan (PSUs) is strategically linked to both growth (revenue), profitability (Adjusted PBT Margin), and stock market performance (relative TSR) over a three-year period, incentivizing sustained value creation rather than short-term gains.
*   **Not Primarily Self-Serving:** The pay structure is demonstrably performance-linked and equity-heavy, which mitigates the risk of executives simply "lining their own pockets" with guaranteed pay, as their ultimate compensation is heavily dependent on achieving challenging financial and stock performance targets.

## Price History

Based on a technical and fundamental analysis of Endava plc (DAVA), here is an analysis of its recent price history and trading status.

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Range:** The stock is trading at the extreme lower end of its annual range, with a last closing price of **$6.30** (as of November 21, 2025). Its 52-week range is from a low of **$6.03** to a high of **$34.94**.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** Endava plc (DAVA) is currently trading **4.48%** above its 52-week low of $6.03. This proximity to the low indicates the stock is in a deeply depressed price territory.

3.  **Technical Analysis Outlook (Trading Low):** Technically, the stock is considered to be trading low. The long-term trend remains **negative** and the stock has been assigned a very low technical rating (e.g., 2 out of 10). It is currently near the lower end of its 52-week range, a sign of weakness relative to the broader market.

4.  **Major Stock Drop Explanation (Year-to-Date):** The stock has experienced a significant decline, falling by approximately **69% year-to-date** from a starting price of $30.90 at the beginning of 2025. This huge drop is largely attributed to disappointing financial performance, specifically the **Q1 FY2026 earnings** where both EPS and revenues missed analyst expectations.

5.  **Fundamental Headwinds:** The poor financial results and outlook are tied to **client spending doldrums**, indicating a slowdown in demand for the company's technology services, which has led to analyst downgrades.

6.  **Recent Short-Term Price Movement:** The stock has recently shown a slight short-term positive trend, including a **3.11% gain** on November 21, 2025, which represents a small rebound from its near 52-week low. This recent positive price action helped stabilize investor sentiment following the earlier post-earnings sell-off.

## Long Thesis

Endava is a highly specialized B2B technology consulting company that helps banks and large corporations completely modernize their core systems and adapt to the digital age. The stock is currently trading at a deep discount because clients temporarily paused large technology projects due to economic uncertainty. The bull case argues that this slowdown is ending: Endava has secured a record amount of new deals that are starting soon, which will drive revenue growth and cause the stock price to rebound sharply in the near term. Long term, the company is perfectly positioned to capture the next massive wave of corporate spending by leading the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for its clients. Its unique model—using highly skilled, cost-effective teams in regions like Eastern Europe—gives it a lasting competitive edge, ensuring high-quality results and superior profit margins as global AI adoption accelerates.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The global economy must stabilize, allowing large corporate clients, particularly in finance, to resume their major technology spending projects. Management must successfully pivot the company to be a leading expert in AI implementation faster and better than its larger competitors. The company must also maintain stable operations in its key international delivery centers (like Eastern Europe) and successfully attract and retain top technical talent needed to deliver these complex, high-value projects.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key flaws, risks, and contradictions in the optimistic long thesis for Endava plc (DAVA).

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

| Flaw Category | Long Thesis Assumption | Critique / Reality Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Near-Term Rebound** | "The slowdown is ending: Endava has secured a record amount of new deals that are starting soon, which will drive revenue growth and cause the stock price to rebound sharply." | **Contradicted by current financial guidance.** Endava's most recent results (Q1 FY2026) showed a year-over-year revenue decline and a loss before tax, causing a significant share drop. Guidance for the full fiscal year 2026 anticipates a continued constant currency revenue decline. While large strategic deals are secured, the general pipeline of smaller, non-strategic projects remains weak, and near-term growth is not materializing as rapidly as the thesis suggests. |
| **AI Leadership** | "The company is perfectly positioned to capture the next massive wave of corporate spending by leading the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)." | **High-cost pivot in a crowded, regulated market.** The company is actively pivoting to become "AI-native," but management has acknowledged this shift is "sacrificing near-term profitability". Endava is a small player competing with massive, well-capitalized consulting giants (e.g., Accenture) and nimbler digital competitors like Globant, which has reported much higher year-over-year growth in AI-related initiatives. Furthermore, its heavy exposure to financial services (banking and payments) means it serves heavily regulated industries, which face greater governmental and compliance hurdles to deploying cutting-edge AI compared to other sectors. |
| **Competitive Edge/Margin** | "Its unique model—using highly skilled, cost-effective teams in regions like Eastern Europe—gives it a lasting competitive edge, ensuring high-quality results and superior profit margins." | **Cost-advantage erosion and concentration risk.** The cost advantage from its nearshore delivery centers is under pressure from rising **wage inflation** in key regions like Eastern Europe, which could stall margin recovery. Additionally, the company is highly concentrated geographically, with over 72% of its FY2025 revenue coming from Europe, exposing it to localized regulatory and economic volatility. |
| **Client Stability** | "The global economy must stabilize, allowing large corporate clients, particularly in finance, to resume their major technology spending projects." | **Significant client concentration risk.** Endava has a notable client concentration risk, with its top ten clients accounting for approximately **36% of revenue**. Any unexpected churn or loss of a major client due to renewed budget cuts or in-sourcing would have a disproportionately severe impact on revenue and profitability compared to peers with a more diversified client base. |

## Bear Case Thesis for Endava plc (DAVA)

The stock's valuation discount is justified by a structural shift and near-term financial weakness, not a temporary pause. The company is stuck in a difficult transition, betting its future on a highly competitive, low-margin AI-driven IT services market.

1.  **Prolonged Financial Weakness:** The cyclical downturn is not over, as confirmed by revenue declines and a negative full-year guidance, suggesting the stock's discount is a fair reflection of shrinking top-line performance. The reliance on large, infrequent "mega-deals" to offset weakness in the non-strategic project pipeline creates lumpy, unpredictable revenue and earnings.
2.  **AI Commoditization and Competitive Overlap:** Endava's aggressive pivot to be an "AI-native" service provider will involve significant, near-term profitability sacrifices but offers no clear, sustainable competitive moat against much larger, better-funded global competitors like Accenture and specialist digital transformation firms like Globant. The AI-driven efficiency gains, which are driving the pivot, may also lead to a commoditization of basic IT services, forcing Endava to win bids on price rather than expertise, thus permanently compressing its historical profit margins.
3.  **Margin Erosion and Geographic Risk:** The key source of Endava's historic margin advantage—cost-effective Eastern European delivery centers—is rapidly being undermined by rising **wage inflation** in those regions. Coupled with a heavy geographic and client concentration risk, any political instability or regulatory changes in Europe could halt its financial recovery and exacerbate operational costs.

## Next Steps

The initial analysis is comprehensive, and the first set of targeted searches has yielded crucial, actionable data points that address some of the biggest open questions in your bull and bear theses.

Here is what you've found and what you should look at next:

### **What You Have Found (New Information)**

1.  **Quantifying Client Concentration (Risk Confirmed):**
    *   The top 10 clients accounted for **36% of revenue in FY2025** (and 39% in Q3 FY2025), which validates the "significant client concentration risk" in the bear case.
2.  **Quantifying Industry Concentration (Shifting):**
    *   The former "Payments and Financial Services" vertical has been split. For Q4 FY2024, the key components were: **Payments (19%), Banking & Capital Markets (17%), and Insurance (9%)**, totaling **45%** of revenue, confirming high financial sector exposure.
3.  **Wage Inflation Impact (Risk Mitigated Short-Term):**
    *   Management stated that inflation has **"not meaningfully impacted our profitability in the fiscal year 2024,"** as the demand slowdown allowed them to control costs by **"limiting wage increases and by restructuring our headcount base."** This suggests the wage inflation risk is temporarily suppressed by the current weak demand.
4.  **Valuation (Discount Confirmed):**
    *   Analysis suggests DAVA is trading at a "trough multiple of trough earnings" and at a deep discount. One report estimates the company is **undervalued by 87%** compared to its estimated relative value. Another suggests a potential doubling of the share price to $50 on margin and growth improvement (implying an EV/EBIT multiple of $\sim$12x vs. the estimated current 6.5x).

### **Next Steps and Unanswered Questions to Investigate**

The next steps should pivot from quantifying the risks to **benchmarking the company's future strategy (AI)** and looking closer at the **competitive landscape's reaction** to the current downturn.

| Step | Focus Area | Why It's Important |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Quantify the AI Transition (Competitive Benchmarking)** | **Key Question:** What portion of Endava's *current* revenue or total addressable market is explicitly attributed to AI projects, and how does this compare to a key competitor like Globant or EPAM? | The entire long thesis rests on becoming "AI-native." You must quantify if this is a material revenue driver *now* or just a long-term aspiration, especially since management mentioned "sacrificing near-term profitability" for this pivot. |
| **2. Geopolitical and Operational Risk (Specific Location Check)** | **Key Question:** Are there specific, recent company filings or reliable news reports detailing the operational status or any client/staffing impact related to its delivery centers in Moldova, Romania, or other Eastern European hubs? | Your bear case lists "geopolitical instability" as a major risk. While wage inflation is controlled, a sudden disruption in Eastern Europe could immediately compromise their entire nearshore cost advantage. |
| **3. Analyst Consensus & Price Targets (Sentiment Check)** | **Key Question:** What are the most recent (post-Q1 FY2026 earnings) analyst ratings and average price targets for DAVA, and what are their primary reasons for the Buy/Hold/Sell recommendations? | This will provide an external, professional view on whether the "trough multiple" is seen as a buy signal or a reflection of permanent impairment, and what the market expects for the next 12 months. |
