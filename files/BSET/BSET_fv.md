## Valuation of Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (BSET)

This valuation uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based *only* on the company's publicly available SEC filings and earnings call transcripts, as stipulated. The goal is to establish a fair value by modeling the company's "business engine" and future cash flows.

### 1. Financial Baseline Data

All financial data is sourced from the latest available SEC filings and earnings report press releases/transcripts, primarily relating to the fiscal year 2025 results (ending August 30, 2025).

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source/Basis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Short-Term Investments** (Liquid Assets) | **\$54.6 million** | Q3 2025 Earnings Call (Liquid Assets). [cite: 5 in step 1] |
| **Total Debt** | **\$0** | Q3 2025 Earnings Call (No outstanding debt). [cite: 5 in step 1] |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **8.686 million** | Latest 10-Q filing reference (8,685,710 shares). [cite: 5 in step 3, 4 in step 3] |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$15.29** | As of October 24, 2025. |
| **LTM Revenue (Q4'24-Q3'25 Baseline)** | **\$330.9 million** | (\$84.3M + \$82.2M + \$84.3M + \$80.1M). [cite: 3 in step 2, 5 in step 2, 12 in step 2, 1 in step 2] |

### 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The business engine for Bassett Furniture is their **integrated domestic retail and wholesale model**, focusing on custom-built furniture, design services, and leveraging their US manufacturing base. Management's recent strategy has been an aggressive **restructuring and cost-cutting initiative** to right-size the business for a period of "tepid demand for home furnishings" and a "historically weak housing market." [cite: 19 in step 2, 12 in step 2]

The key assumption for the future is that the cost structure is now leaner and that the company will achieve modest revenue growth by focusing on efficiency until the housing market provides a significant industry-wide tailwind.

#### A. Revenue Engine Assumptions

| Year | Revenue Growth Assumption | Justification (Based on Transcripts) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Base Year) | **\$330.9 million** (LTM) | Based on the sum of the last four reported quarters, which establishes a clear run-rate *after* the closure of the unprofitable Noa Home international e-commerce business. [cite: 4 in step 1, 12 in step 2] |
| **2026** | **+3.0%** | The core domestic business (excluding the closed segment) showed normalized growth between 2.2% and 7.3% in Q1-Q3 2025. [cite: 12 in step 2, 5 in step 2, 2 in step 2] A conservative **3.0%** is used, assuming their new collections and e-commerce initiatives will slightly outpace the currently weak industry environment, but without assuming a major housing market rebound. |
| **2027-2029** | **+4.0%** | Assumes the domestic housing market begins a modest, cyclical recovery in 2027-2029. This is still a conservative rate for a cyclical business in a recovery phase, reflecting management's focus on "growth and productivity" and "position[ing] us very competitively for 2025" and beyond. [cite: 19 in step 2, 12 in step 2] |
| **2030** | **+2.0%** | A very conservative drop-off to a long-term normalized growth rate, reflecting the mature, cyclical nature of the home furnishings industry. |

#### B. Margin Assumptions

| Metric | Projected % | Justification (Based on Transcripts) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin (GM)** | **56.0%** | Recent GMs were Q1'25: 57.0%, Q2'25: 55.6%, Q3'25: 56.2%. The high margin is attributed to "improved margins in the wholesale segment" and "restructuring." [cite: 12 in step 2, 8 in step 2, 2 in step 2] **56.0%** is a sustainable, conservative average of recent results post-restructuring. |
| **SG&A as % of Sales** | **53.5%** | Recent SG&A %: Q1'25: 54.0%, Q2'25: 52.7%, Q3'25: 55.4%. The reduction is due to "restructuring benefits," "cost containment," and "greater leverage of fixed costs from higher sales levels." [cite: 12 in step 2, 8 in step 2, 2 in step 2] **53.5%** assumes continued but diminishing efficiency gains and successful leverage against a rising revenue base. |
| **Operating Margin (OM)** | **2.5%** | 56.0% (GM) - 53.5% (SG&A) = 2.5%. This is close to the average of the last three profitable quarters' operating margins (Q1'25: 3.0%, Q2'25: 3.0%, Q3'25: 0.7%). [cite: 12 in step 2, 8 in step 2, 2 in step 2] |
| **Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | A conservative blended Federal/State statutory tax rate, assuming a return to sustained profitability. |
| **ROIC** | **8.0%** | While past ROIC has been negative during the restructuring phase (as indicated by the net losses), a conservative but positive rate is required for valuation. The company operates in a mature industry with a tangible asset base. A conservative, achievable **8.0%** is used, which is above the typical cost of capital but acknowledges the cash-rich, debt-free balance sheet and improved operating efficiency. |

### 3. Projected Financials and Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| (Dollars in millions) | **2025 (Base)** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **330.9** | **340.8** | **354.4** | **368.6** | **383.3** | **391.0** |
| *Growth Rate* | | 3.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 2.0% |
| **Operating Income (OI)** | 8.3 | 8.5 | 8.9 | 9.2 | 9.6 | 9.8 |
| *Operating Margin* | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% | 2.5% |
| **Prior Year's Net Income (to ROIC)** | 1.4 | 6.2 | 6.4 | 6.6 | 6.8 | 7.0 |
| **ROIC Income (8.0%)** | 0.1 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
| **Pre-Tax Income (OI + ROIC Income)** | 8.4 | 9.0 | 9.4 | 9.7 | 10.1 | 10.3 |
| **Taxes (25.0%)** | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.4 | 2.4 | 2.5 | 2.6 |
| **Projected Net Income** | **6.3** | **6.7** | **7.1** | **7.3** | **7.6** | **7.7** |

*Note: The Net Income from the prior year is used for the ROIC calculation in the subsequent year (as per the rule: "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage..."). The Q4'24-Q3'25 (LTM) Net Income of \$1.4M is used for 2026 ROIC calculation.*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### A. Discount and Maturity Rates

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **1.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a very conservative rate, well below the long-term US GDP growth and their projected normalized growth, to reflect the high cyclicality and maturity of the furniture retail industry.
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **10.0%**
    *   *Justification:* Given the company has **\$0 debt**, the cost of capital is primarily the cost of equity. A 10.0% rate is a high, conservative rate often used as a baseline for equity investments, reflecting the risk associated with a cyclical business, even one with a strong balance sheet.

#### B. Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the perpetuity method based on the 2030 Net Income, assuming this cash flow grows at the maturity rate forever.

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Projected Net Income}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$7.7 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01} = \frac{\$7.78 \text{ million}}{0.09} = \$86.44 \text{ million}
$$

#### C. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Projected Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$6.7 | 0.909 | \$6.09 |
| **2027** | \$7.1 | 0.826 | \$5.86 |
| **2028** | \$7.3 | 0.751 | \$5.48 |
| **2029** | \$7.6 | 0.683 | \$5.19 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | \$7.7 | 0.621 | \$4.78 |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | \$86.44 | 0.621 | \$53.69 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$81.09 million** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of the Equity is calculated by taking the Net Present Value of the cash flows (the operational value of the business) and adding the existing cash while subtracting the outstanding debt.

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$81.09 \text{ million} + \$54.6 \text{ million} - \$0 = \$135.69 \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$135.69 \text{ million}}{8.686 \text{ million shares}} = \mathbf{\$15.62}
$$

---

## Fair Value and Justification

**Fair Value per Share (DCF):** **\$15.62**
**Current Market Price per Share (BSET):** **\$15.29**

### Conclusion and Market Assumptions

The calculated Fair Value of **\$15.62** is almost exactly in line with the current market price of **\$15.29**.

#### Justification for the Market/Fair Value Alignment

The near-perfect alignment suggests that the market is making assumptions very similar to the conservative, data-driven engine developed in this analysis:

1.  **Business Stabilization is Priced In:** The market has already acknowledged and priced in the successful restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. Management's commentary on "running a leaner business" [cite: 19 in step 2] and the return to profitability over the last three quarters (Q1-Q3 2025) after a period of losses is not a surprise. The market assumes the new, higher gross margin (around 56%) and lower SG&A run-rate are sustainable.

2.  **Conservative Growth is the Default:** The market is not pricing in a rapid, housing-boom-driven growth scenario. The 3.0% to 4.0% revenue growth assumption used here—a modest recovery from the current tepid environment—is what the market appears to expect from a cyclical player like BSET. The stock is currently trading close to its 52-week low of \$13.58, and well below its high of \$19.75, which reflects the ongoing cautious sentiment regarding the furniture/housing sector.

3.  **High Value on Net Cash:** The high proportion of the company's value derived from its cash balance (\$54.6M cash vs. \$81.09M operational NPV) is a key factor. This cash pile acts as a strong safety net and future funding source for dividends or acquisitions. The market highly values the company's **\$0 outstanding debt** [cite: 5 in step 1] and net-cash position, which is a major point of strength in a cyclical industry. The fair value calculation explicitly recognizes this liquid asset, bringing the intrinsic value up.

4.  **Capital Return Expected:** The stock has a high dividend yield (5.23% as of a recent quote), which is funded by the strong cash position and a return to profitability. The market is likely valuing BSET as a stable, cash-generating, dividend-paying company in a mature industry, which is precisely what the DCF model captures with a moderate WACC (10.0%) and low terminal growth (1.0%).

In summary, the market's current valuation is rational and reflects the company's transition from a money-losing, over-leveraged cost structure to a profitable, cash-rich, and efficient domestic business with modest, single-digit growth potential in a challenging market.
