## Business Summary

The Manitowoc Company operates a global Business-to-Business (B2B) model focused on designing, manufacturing, and servicing industrial lifting solutions, primarily heavy-duty cranes. Its core customers are large construction firms, equipment rental providers, and industrial companies engaged in major infrastructure, energy, and commercial building projects worldwide. The company generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of new, specialized equipment, while a crucial part of the business model involves stable, higher-margin aftermarket sales of parts and maintenance services that support the large installed base of cranes currently in use globally.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for The Manitowoc Company stems from the highly cyclical nature of the construction and capital goods industries, meaning demand for expensive new cranes can drop rapidly during economic slowdowns, credit tightening, or when raw material costs (like steel) suddenly increase and squeeze profit margins. In the long term, the company faces threats from increased global competition and government policy shifts that delay or reduce major infrastructure spending. This reliance on discretionary capital spending has historically caused sharp drops in earnings and market positioning during past recessions, such as the 2008 financial crisis, making current inflationary and high interest rate environments a major cause for continued concern.

## Company History

The history of The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) is a long story of survival, major diversification, and a final return to its roots as a pure-play lifting solutions company.

### **I. Inception and Early Years (1902 - 1945): From Shipyard to War Machine**

1.  **Founding Purpose (1902):** The company was founded by Charles C. West and Elias Gunnell as the **Manitowoc Dry Dock Company** in Wisconsin. The original business goal was to construct and repair ships on the shores of Lake Michigan.
2.  **The First Problem: A Call for Diversification (Post-WWI):** After World War I, the U.S. government canceled large freighter contracts, causing a sharp revenue drop and a postwar depression for the company.
3.  **The First Innovative Solution: Cranes (1925):** To create a more stable business beyond the volatile shipbuilding market, the company diversified and began manufacturing cranes under a contract with another company. This marked the unplanned, yet successful, beginning of their future core business.
4.  **Major Headwind: The Great Depression:** Sales for the entire company plummeted dramatically in the early 1930s, forcing the business to operate at a net loss for several years.
5.  **Major Tailwind: World War II (1940s):** The company received significant contracts from the U.S. Navy to build a total of 28 submarines and over a thousand landing craft, providing a massive influx of stability and profit.

### **II. The Era of Diversification (1945 - 2000): Cranes, Ice, and Conglomerate Growth**

6.  **Problem: Post-War Reorganization:** Following WWII, the company faced the familiar challenge of switching production from wartime military orders back to a peacetime economy.
7.  **Solution: New Diversification (Foodservice):** The leadership decided to enter a completely new market by manufacturing commercial freezers and later expanded into the profitable commercial ice-making machine business in 1966, which helped stabilize revenue.
8.  **Innovation: The VICON® System (1950s-1960s):** The crane division developed a breakthrough, patented control system called VICON (Variable Independent Control). This system used special torque converters instead of older, less-precise clutch systems, giving operators much smoother and more precise control over the crane's major movements.
9.  **Innovation: Design and Materials:** They pioneered the use of high-strength steel in crane booms and were the first to develop extendible crawlers (the tracks a crawler crane uses), which significantly increased the lifting capacity of their machines.
10. **Headwind: The Economic Rollercoaster (1980s):** The cyclical nature of heavy construction and energy markets hit the company hard, as the collapse of the petroleum boom caused another dramatic plunge in their crane sales.

### **III. Globalization and Strategic Focus (2000 - Present): The Crane Leader**

11. **Solution: Global Acquisition Blitz (Early 2000s):** To become a true global leader, the company acquired key competitors: Potain (French tower cranes) in 2001 and Grove (mobile telescopic cranes) in 2002. These purchases immediately propelled the company's revenue past the $1 billion mark and made them a full-line, multi-brand lifting powerhouse.
12. **The Inherent Problem: Extreme Cyclicality:** The fundamental headwind remained: the crane business is highly cyclical, meaning sales boom during construction peaks but can crash during economic downturns, making overall company performance unpredictable.
13. **Final Innovative Solution: The Spin-Off (2016):** Responding to pressure from activist investors who wanted the non-cyclical, steady Foodservice division separated from the volatile Crane business, the company completed a tax-free spin-off. This action created two independent, publicly-traded companies: The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW), focused purely on cranes, and Manitowoc Foodservice (now Welbilt).
14. **Current Goal and CRANES+50 Strategy:** Today, The Manitowoc Company's goal is to be the global leader in "engineered lifting solutions." Their primary strategy is **CRANES+50**, which seeks to transform the business by dramatically growing the stable, high-profit aftermarket business (selling parts, service, and repairs).
15. **The Modern-Day Solution:** This strategy is designed to lessen the impact of the business cycle by creating a reliable, consistent revenue stream from service, which is less dependent on the unpredictable demand for brand-new machines.
16. **Ongoing Headwind: Competition and Compliance:** Modern challenges include stiff foreign competition, which led the company to file an anti-dumping petition against some producers, and regulatory issues, such as a recent settlement over the use of non-compliant diesel engines in their cranes.

## Moat Analysis

The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) has built its economic moat primarily on a combination of deep-seated industry leadership, a vast and complex product and service ecosystem, and strategic customer lock-in.

### **Analysis of MTW's Moat and Differentiation**

#### **1. Differentiated Market Position and Product Breadth**
*   MTW holds a leading market position globally in various crane categories, particularly high-capacity lattice-boom crawler cranes and tower cranes (Potain brand).
*   It offers one of the most comprehensive ranges of lifting equipment in the world, including crawler cranes, mobile telescopic cranes (Grove), tower cranes (Potain), and boom trucks (National Crane).
*   This breadth is a key differentiator, as few competitors can match the scope of its products and its worldwide manufacturing and distribution footprint across the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

#### **2. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue**
*   New crane sales are cyclical and one-time, but MTW’s strong aftermarket business is a powerful source of recurring, sticky revenue.
*   The company's strategy is to transform into a more customer-focused service business by growing non-new machine sales, such as parts, maintenance, remanufacturing, and rentals (known as the "CRANES+50 strategy").
*   Aftermarket services offer much higher gross margins (around 35%) than new machine sales, and management notes this business model creates "much more stickiness" with the customer.

#### **3. High Switching Costs and Pricing Power**
*   Manitowoc products consistently maintain the **highest resale values** in the industry, which effectively lowers the total cost of ownership for customers and encourages them to purchase the brand again.
*   The massive installed base of cranes requires proprietary, specialized replacement parts and expert service support, creating high switching costs for owners once they have the equipment.
*   Its market leadership in specialized, high-capacity lifting equipment grants it a degree of pricing power in those specific, critical segments, though it faces general pricing pressure from competitors, particularly in emerging markets like the Middle East.

#### **4. The Reason for Growth: Reputation and Ecosystem**
*   The company's century-plus history (founded in 1902) and its reputation for quality, reliability, and innovation were cemented by strategic brand acquisitions like Potain and Grove, which secured its global leadership position.
*   Its customer-focused approach, called "The Manitowoc Way," involves gathering input from contractors and rental specialists to drive product development, ensuring its cranes meet real-world, high-value needs.

#### **5. Barriers to Displacement and Competition**
*   **Difficulty of Displacement:** Displacing MTW is difficult due to the high barrier to entry in the heavy machinery industry, which is capital-intensive and requires decades of engineering expertise and safety accreditation.
*   A competitor with more capital would still need to build an equivalent global service network, replicate the product portfolio across all major crane types, and earn the trust that comes with a high-stakes, safety-critical business.
*   The extensive portfolio of intellectual property, including over 150 patents, also acts as a powerful barrier.

#### **6. Innovation and Network Effects**
*   **R&D and Innovation:** MTW invests heavily in Research and Development (R&D) and must constantly innovate to maintain its technological edge, as demonstrated by the launch of numerous new or refreshed models since 2021.
*   Innovation focuses on new applications like wind turbine crane technology, and advanced features like IoT-enabled (smart) and autonomous crane systems.
*   **Network Effects:** While not a traditional social network effect, the large, global installed base of Manitowoc, Potain, and Grove cranes creates a powerful ecosystem or indirect network effect. This installed base attracts a large network of trained technicians, specialized dealers, and rental companies (distributors), which in turn, makes the equipment more attractive to new buyers because support is readily available worldwide.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that could increase The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) stock price are centered on its strategic shift toward more stable, high-margin revenue streams and a potential recovery in core crane markets.

### Near-Term Catalysts (0-12 Months)

1.  **Aftermarket Expansion and Acquisitions:** Management is actively pursuing its strategy to expand its direct-to-customer business, as shown by its recent acquisition of distribution rights in the Carolinas and Georgia, which is expected to boost their high-margin, stable aftermarket sales in the U.S.
2.  **Backlog Conversion and New Orders:** The company's backlog remains a source of near-term revenue, and an increase in new orders, which grew 8.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, signals potential growth in a key metric.
3.  **Trade Protection:** The filing of an anti-dumping duty petition in the U.S. is a catalyst that could lead to government action, which would help protect the domestic market from foreign competitors and improve the pricing environment for new machines.
4.  **Defense/Government Contract Potential:** Achieving a Level 2 CMMC Certification from the U.S. Department of Defense could open up opportunities for significant new government-related contracts and sales.

### Long-Term Catalysts (1+ Year)

1.  **Shifting Revenue Mix to Aftermarket:** The core long-term strategy, known as **CRANES+50**, is focused on increasing non-new machine sales (parts, service, rental, etc.) to 50% of revenue, making the company less dependent on volatile new crane sales cycles. Management states that these sales grew 67% from 2020 to 2024, reaching a record \$629.1 million.
2.  **Growth in Key Geographies:** Management's strategy explicitly targets expanding the aftermarket presence in North America and growing its market share, especially for European tower cranes and its **Belt & Road** initiative (Middle East region).
3.  **New Product Development (NPD):** The company plans to showcase new innovative products and is leveraging All-terrain New Product Development (NPD) to further grow its aftermarket business, which should strengthen its market position and product portfolio over time.
4.  **Economic Recovery in Crane Markets:** An overall improvement in global construction and infrastructure spending, especially a recovery in the market for high-margin European tower cranes, would boost volumes and factory utilization, solving the "weak absorption of fixed costs" challenge mentioned in the Q1 2024 earnings call.

### Management Commentary on Catalysts and Strategy (Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Aftermarket Focus:** CEO Aaron Ravenscroft emphasized the strength of the aftermarket business and its record revenue as a key highlight for 2024, stating the company "remains focused on continuing to grow our non-new machine sales."
*   **Strategic Growth Initiatives:** The four key breakthrough initiatives under the CRANES+50 strategy are: expanding the North American aftermarket, growing the European tower crane rental and aftermarket, leveraging All-terrain New Product Development (NPD), and growing the Belt & Road presence.
*   **Volatile Market Acknowledgment:** In the first-quarter 2024 call, the management noted that weak demand for European tower cranes was a drag on profitability due to "weak absorption of fixed costs," indicating that market stability is a necessary catalyst for margin improvement.

## Management Record

The management analysis of The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) focuses on the transition from the post-spin-off strategy to the current "CRANES+50" vision.

### **Current Management (Aaron H. Ravenscroft - CEO since August 2020)**

1.  **CEO Background and Transition:** Aaron H. Ravenscroft was appointed President and CEO in August 2020, succeeding Barry L. Pennypacker as part of a stated leadership transition plan. He joined Manitowoc in 2016 as EVP of Cranes, where his prior focus included improving product quality, customer service, and operational efficiency.

2.  **Current Strategy and Vision ("CRANES+50"):** The long-term vision, known as "CRANES+50," is a strategic shift to reduce the company's dependence on the cyclical new crane market. The strategy aims to transform the company from a product-centric to a customer-oriented, service-focused model, emphasizing higher-margin, recurring revenue streams.

3.  **Performance on Key Strategic Promises:** Management has successfully grown its non-new machine (aftermarket) sales, increasing this revenue stream by over 67% from 2020 to 2024. This aftermarket segment is strategically important due to its higher gross margins (cited around 35%) and is intended to be a more stable business driver.

4.  **Future Growth Targets:** The long-term aspiration is to grow annual aftermarket sales to $\$1$ billion, contributing to a total annual revenue goal of $\$3$ billion (up from approximately $\$2.2$ billion in 2024). The strategy also includes a focus on continuous improvement ("The Manitowoc Way"), capacity rationalization, and opportunistic mergers and acquisitions (M\&A) of dealer channels to expand the service footprint (e.g., the acquisition of the H\&E Equipment Services crane business and Aspen Equipment).

5.  **Recent Financial Track Record & Sentiment:** The company achieved an impressive 208\% rise in Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the latest three-year period leading up to August 2025, which reflects successful cost and operational improvements. However, the stock has recently underperformed the S\&P 500 over the past year, and a low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio suggests market skepticism about the sustainability of future earnings growth in the short term.

### **Previous Management & Key Decisions**

6.  **Former CEO and Mandate:** Barry L. Pennypacker served as CEO from 2015 to August 2020, having been appointed to lead the Cranes business after the separation from Foodservice. The board credited him with expanding the product portfolio and significantly enhancing profitability, successfully positioning the company for long-term growth as a standalone crane business.

7.  **The Foodservice Spin-off (2016):** The major strategic decision was the tax-free spin-off of the Manitowoc Foodservice segment (now Welbilt, Inc.) in March 2016. This move was largely prompted by pressure from activist investors, notably Carl Icahn, who advocated for separating the cyclical crane business from the stable Foodservice business to unlock shareholder value.

8.  **Shareholder Value from Spin-off:** The rationale for the separation was to allow each new company—Manitowoc Cranes (MTW) and Manitowoc Foodservice—to pursue distinct corporate strategies and improve capital allocation. Following the spin-off, Manitowoc shareholders received stock in both independent companies.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of The Manitowoc Company, Inc.'s (MTW) proxy statements (DEF 14A), here is an analysis of their management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Analysis of Management Incentives and Compensation for MTW**

#### **1. High Incentive for Shareholder Alignment**

1.  **High Percentage of At-Risk Pay:** The compensation structure is heavily weighted toward performance, with 84% of the CEO's target pay and approximately 67% of other Named Executive Officers' (NEOs) target pay tied to at-risk, short-term and long-term incentive plans. This high exposure to variable pay suggests management's earnings are significantly reliant on achieving performance goals.
2.  **Use of Shareholder-Friendly Metrics (LTIP):** The long-term incentive plan (LTIP) metrics for 2024 were updated to be 60% weighted to **Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (Adjusted ROIC)** and 40% to **Total Non-New Machine Sales**. The use of Adjusted ROIC is a strong metric for aligning pay with shareholder interest, as it rewards management for efficient use of capital to generate profits.
3.  **Strategic Metric Alignment:** The inclusion of Total Non-New Machine Sales links executive pay directly to the company's "CRANES+50" strategy, which aims to grow the higher-margin, less cyclical aftermarket business for long-term value creation.

#### **2. Insider Ownership and Retention**

1.  **High Stock Ownership Guidelines:** MTW has formal, robust Stock Ownership Guidelines that require significant personal investment from top executives and directors.
2.  **CEO Ownership Requirement:** The CEO is required to hold stock valued at **six times (6x)** their base salary, which is a high multiple and suggests a strong commitment to long-term ownership.
3.  **Retention Mandate:** Executives must retain 50% of the net shares received from vesting Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) or option exercises until their required ownership level is achieved, which reinforces a long-term holding culture.
4.  **CEO Direct Ownership:** As of a recent filing, the CEO's direct ownership was noted at approximately 1.02% of the company's shares. While not the highest absolute number, the mandatory high-multiple holding requirement ensures a significant financial stake in the company's stock price performance.

#### **3. Potential Concerns (Compensation vs. Performance)**

1.  **Compensation Above Market Median:** The CEO's total compensation was reported to be significantly above the median for comparable companies in the industry.
2.  **Pay/Performance Disconnect (Past):** Critics have pointed out that the CEO's compensation for 2023 was high despite a reported 51% loss to shareholders and a 57% decrease in EPS over the previous three years, suggesting a potential disconnect between pay and shareholder return during that period.

### **Conclusion**

The Manitowoc Company's management is largely **incentivized to act in the long-term interest of the shareholders**, primarily due to two structural features:

1.  The very high **stock ownership requirement (6x base salary for the CEO)** and the retention rules mandate that a large portion of their personal wealth is tied up in MTW stock, meaning they benefit only when shareholders do.
2.  The heavy weighting of the incentive program toward the sophisticated, capital-efficiency metric of **Adjusted ROIC** and the strategic target of Non-New Machine Sales suggests a focus on creating sustainable business value rather than easily manipulated short-term results.

The main concern is the historical observation that pay has, at times, increased even when shareholder returns and EPS were negative, which may indicate flaws in the short-term incentive design or performance goal setting. However, the strong structural long-term incentives largely mitigate the risk that management is *solely* incentivized to "line their own pockets."

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) stock:

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock's closing price as of the end of September 26, 2025, was approximately **\$9.98**. Its 52-week trading range is from a low of **\$7.06** to a high of **\$13.62**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **41.36%** above its 52-week low of \$7.06 (Calculation: $(\$9.98 - \$7.06) / \$7.06$).

3.  **Technical Analysis - Trading Low?** The technical picture is mixed, but it is not definitively "trading low." While the stock is in a short-term **falling trend**, its price is closer to a short-term resistance level of \$10.11 than a support level of \$9.81.

4.  **Mixed Technical Signals:** Short-term technical indicators offer conflicting signals: the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is **36.849**, which suggests a "Sell," and the 200-day moving average is also indicating a "Sell". However, the long-term moving average generates a "Buy" signal, and overall, some models consider the current level a buying opportunity in the short term despite the falling trend.

5.  **Big Drops Explained (August 2025):** The stock experienced a significant drop recently, losing approximately **25%** in the month leading up to mid-August 2025. This sharp decline was correlated with the company's **Second Quarter 2025 earnings report** on August 8, where both **Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenues missed analyst expectations**.

6.  **Analyst Outlook:** The general analyst consensus rating is a **"Reduce,"** but the average price target is **\$11.00**, which implies a moderate upside from the current price. Furthermore, company insiders have recently been very positive, purchasing a large amount of shares compared to sales.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Manitowoc relies on its successful pivot away from relying solely on selling expensive, volatile new cranes, toward building a stable, high-margin parts and service business. The long-term strategy, CRANES+50, is working, dramatically increasing revenue from servicing its massive global fleet of existing equipment. This shift stabilizes overall earnings, protecting the company during inevitable construction slowdowns. In the near term, strategic acquisitions of local dealerships will expand their direct service footprint, immediately boosting higher-profit revenue. Furthermore, MTW holds premium brand leadership (like Potain and Grove), giving it pricing power and high customer loyalty, as its equipment consistently commands the highest resale value in the industry. As global infrastructure spending eventually increases and market demand recovers, MTW is well-positioned, supported by leadership that is financially committed to long-term stock performance.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This positive outcome is dependent on several assumptions: 1) The growth in the high-margin parts and service business (Aftermarket) must continue to accelerate as planned, effectively offsetting the cyclicality of new crane sales. 2) Global construction and infrastructure spending, particularly in critical markets like Europe, must stabilize or recover, preventing factory slowdowns that hurt profitability. 3) Management must successfully integrate recent dealership acquisitions and efficiently use capital. 4) The company must maintain its premium brand reputation and technological edge against growing pressure from foreign competitors.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW) contains several significant vulnerabilities when checked against recent financial and market data, forming the basis of a strong bear case.

### Bear Case Thesis: Critique and Flaws

1.  **Aftermarket Growth is Insufficient to Offset Cyclicality:** The primary argument—that the high-margin parts and service business (CRANES+50) stabilizes earnings—is contradicted by recent results. Despite non-new machine sales reaching a record high, full-year net sales and pre-tax profits have significantly declined, and the company was forced to lower its full-year guidance for 2025. This indicates that the new machine cyclicality remains the dominant driver of overall earnings, not the "stable, high-margin" services business.

2.  **Weakening Core Market Demand is Causing Factory Slowdowns:** The bull case prematurely assumes a market recovery, but management has cited "sluggish" order intake for mobile cranes in North America and Europe and a "challenging" European tower crane market. The company has responded to this weak demand by "adjusting its build schedules" in the second half of the year to reduce inventory, which directly translates to factory slowdowns, contrary to the bull case's optimism.

3.  **Significant Cash Flow and Capital Management Issues:** The strategy of making strategic dealership acquisitions and growing the rental fleet requires efficient capital allocation. However, the company recently reported sharply negative non-GAAP Free Cash Flow, which is a major concern about the ability to generate and manage cash effectively. This suggests integration costs and working capital management, including inventory reduction efforts, are creating a strain on liquidity.

4.  **Increasing Headwinds and Pressure from Foreign Competitors:** The premium brand reputation and pricing power are facing concrete competitive and macroeconomic threats. Major Chinese and European manufacturers, such as SANY, XCMG, and Liebherr, are active and increasing competition in core markets. Furthermore, management has cited "tariffs" and "macroeconomic conditions" (like inflation and high interest rates) as ongoing issues, suggesting external factors are eroding the perceived pricing power and margin insulation the premium brand is supposed to provide.

5.  **Declining Order Backlog and Forward Outlook:** A key indicator of future revenue, the order backlog, was down significantly at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023. The company's subsequent reduction in 2025 full-year guidance for both net sales and Adjusted EBITDA also signals management's diminished confidence in the near-term recovery and growth trajectory of the new machine segment.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the existing comprehensive analysis, the primary conflict is between the bullish long-term strategy (CRANES+50) and the bearish reality of current market cyclicality (recent misses and lowered guidance).

The next steps should be focused on quantifying the financial impact of the strategy, the market headwinds, and the competitive environment to determine which force is truly dominant.

### **Next Steps to Investigate Further**

1.  **Quantify the Impact of the CRANES+50 Strategy (Aftermarket Revenue Mix)**
    *   Determine the current and historical percentage of total revenue derived from **Non-New Machine Sales** (Aftermarket, parts, service) to accurately gauge how close the company is to the "50%" goal and its actual success in reducing cyclicality. The Q2 2025 data shows Non-New Machine Sales were \$161.6 million out of \$539.5 million in total sales, which represents approximately **30%** of total revenue in the quarter, and a record of over **32%** for the six months ending June 2025. This should be confirmed and monitored quarterly.

2.  **Clarify Cash Flow and Inventory Strain**
    *   Investigate the specific causes of the sharply negative Free Cash Flow (FCF) of \$(73.7) million in Q2 2025 compared to \$(1.9) million in the previous year. Determine what portion of this FCF draw is due to increasing **inventory** (which climbed 28% since year-end) versus one-time **capital expenditures** for dealer acquisitions and rental fleet growth, which directly informs the quality of capital allocation.

3.  **Establish the Status of Trade Protection Measures**
    *   Research the outcome of the anti-dumping petition against lattice-boom crawler cranes from Japan. The petition, filed in April 2025, has a Commerce Final Determination deadline of December 1, 2025, and a final order issuance deadline of January 22, 2026. The analyst needs to check for a *preliminary* determination or any official status update closer to the date of the analysis to gauge the likelihood of tariffs being imposed, which would improve the pricing environment for their premium equipment.

4.  **Analyze Competitor Market Share and Pricing Pressure**
    *   Conduct a focused search on the pricing strategies and new product launches of key foreign competitors mentioned in the analysis (SANY, XCMG, Liebherr) in the North American and European markets to verify if MTW's brand loyalty and highest resale value are meaningfully insulating it from competitive pricing pressure.

5.  **Examine the Status of Key End Markets**
    *   Deep dive into the projected near-term spending in key crane end-markets that are expected to be strong, specifically checking for updates on **German infrastructure funding** and the pace of projects related to **Saudi Vision 2030** in the Middle East. Management highlighted both the strength of the Middle East and improving European tower crane orders (up 104% year-over-year in Q2 2025) as green shoots, but the overall market remains weak due to U.S. tariff-related uncertainty.
