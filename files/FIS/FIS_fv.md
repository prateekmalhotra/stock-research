This valuation of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS) utilizes a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on financial data from the company's latest SEC filings and a conservative projection of its core, post-Worldpay business engine.

All financial figures are in millions of U.S. Dollars, except per-share data and percentages.

---

## 1. Financial Inputs from SEC Filings

The data is sourced from FIS's latest available SEC filings and related press releases, most notably the Q2 2025 earnings release (August 5, 2025) and its annual report.

| Metric | Value (USD) | Source/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$\$$67.52** | Closing price as of October 24, 2025. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | **522.38 million** | As of October 2025. |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$\$$581 million** | Estimated cash on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2025. |
| **Total Debt** | **$\$$12,900 million** (or $\$$12.9 billion) | Debt outstanding as of June 30, 2025. |
| **Last Full Year (2024) Revenue** | **$\$$10,100 million** (or $\$$10.1 billion) | GAAP Revenue for full year 2024. |
| **Last Full Year (2024) Net Income** | **$\$$787 million** | GAAP Net Earnings from Continuing Operations for full year 2024. |

*Note: The valuation projects the **current continuing operations** (Banking and Capital Markets), deliberately excluding the financial impact of the Global Payments Issuer Solutions acquisition (expected H1 2026) in the core model to maintain a conservative stance and strictly adhere to using current debt and cash figures. This will be addressed in the final justification.*

## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

The core business engine of FIS post-Worldpay is comprised of two key, high-retention, high-recurring revenue segments: **Banking Solutions** (approx. 70% of core business) and **Capital Market Solutions**.

The business is driven by:
1.  **Recurring Revenue:** Approximately 81% of core revenue is recurring, providing stability and visibility.
2.  **Commercial Excellence:** Management attributes recent growth acceleration to commercial excellence, net new sales, and strong client retention.
3.  **Cross-Selling/Market Share:** Focus on expanding existing client relationships and geographic coverage.

### Revenue Growth Assumptions

| Year | Banking Solutions Growth (Assumed) | Capital Market Solutions Growth (Assumed) | Total Adjusted Revenue (Base $10.1B) | Overall Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $4.25\%$ (Midpoint of $4.0-4.5\%$) | $6.75\%$ (Midpoint of $6.5-7.0\%$) | $\$$10,610 | $5.05\%$ | Management's raised guidance midpoint of $4.8\%$ to $5.3\%$ adjusted revenue growth. |
| **2026** | $4.00\%$ | $6.50\%$ | $\$$11,048 | $4.13\%$ | Conservative step-down. Assumes slight post-acquisition (Global Payments) integration focus and moderate economic slowdown impacting non-recurring (license) revenue. |
| **2027** | $3.50\%$ | $5.50\%$ | $\$$11,418 | $3.35\%$ | Further conservatism, reflecting a maturing core market but stable growth due to high recurring revenue. |
| **2028** | $3.00\%$ | $4.50\%$ | $\$$11,749 | $2.90\%$ | Continues to slow, but stays ahead of industry inflation/GDP growth driven by a solid $81\%$ recurring base. |
| **2029** | $2.50\%$ | $4.00\%$ | $\$$12,042 | $2.50\%$ | Slowing to a long-term normalized growth rate for a mature fintech provider. |
| **2030** | $2.50\%$ | $3.50\%$ | $\$$12,327 | $2.37\%$ | Approaching the Terminal Growth Rate, reflecting long-term stability and market saturation. |

*Note: To simplify the calculation while being conservative, I will calculate the $\$$ change for each segment and sum it up, which results in the Total Adjusted Revenue shown.*

## 3. Margin Projection & Net Income Calculation

### Margin Assumptions

Management guidance focuses on expanding adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately $20$ basis points (bps) and achieving a free cash flow (FCF) conversion rate of $82\%$ to $85\%$ of adjusted net earnings. The strategy is explicitly focused on *operational simplification* and *reducing capital intensity* (CapEx target is $8\%$ of revenue). This directly translates into stronger future GAAP Net Income.

To project **GAAP Net Income** (which is used as the proxy for Cash Flow in this instruction's model), I use the 2024 GAAP Net Income/Revenue ratio and assume an improvement reflecting the $20$ bps EBITDA margin expansion and improved cost structure.

| Year | Revenue ($M) | Est. Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income ($M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual Base)** | $\$$10,100 | $7.8\%$ ($\$$787M / $\$$10,100M) | $\$$787 |
| **2025** | $\$$10,610 | $8.0\%$ | $\$$849 |
| **2026** | $\$$11,048 | $8.5\%$ | $\$$940 |
| **2027** | $\$$11,418 | $9.0\%$ | $\$$1,028 |
| **2028** | $\$$11,749 | $9.5\%$ | $\$$1,116 |
| **2029** | $\$$12,042 | $10.0\%$ | $\$$1,204 |
| **2030** | $\$$12,327 | $10.5\%$ | $\$$1,294 |

*Justification:* The Net Income Margin expansion from $7.8\%$ to $10.5\%$ by 2030 is conservative compared to the projected *Adjusted* EBITDA Margin expansion (20bps increase per year is often management's guide to a higher base) and the stated goal of significantly improved Free Cash Flow conversion. This projection bakes in the benefit of the restructuring and focus on high-margin core products.

### Net Income with ROIC Calculation

The instruction requires incorporating a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for additional income.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** Since the historical ROIC can be volatile or negative due to the Worldpay impairment, and the instruction calls for a **conservative but reasonable positive ROIC** when projecting positive net income, I will use a conservative **$10\%$ ROIC**. This reflects a mature, stable technology services company that reinvests its prior year's retained earnings (Net Income) into its high-margin recurring business.

$$
\text{Net Income}_{n} = \text{Projected Net Income}_{n} + (\text{Net Income}_{n-1} \times \text{ROIC})
$$

| Year | Projected Net Income (from Margin, $A$) | Prior Year Net Income ($B$) | ROIC Contribution ($B \times 10\%$) | **Total Net Income** ($A + C$, used as Cash Flow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $\$$849 | $\$$787 | $\$$79 | **$\$$928** |
| **2026** | $\$$940 | $\$$928 | $\$$93 | **$\$$1,033** |
| **2027** | $\$$1,028 | $\$$1,033 | $\$$103 | **$\$$1,131** |
| **2028** | $\$$1,116 | $\$$1,131 | $\$$113 | **$\$$1,229** |
| **2029** | $\$$1,204 | $\$$1,229 | $\$$123 | **$\$$1,327** |
| **2030** | $\$$1,294 | $\$$1,327 | $\$$133 | **$\$$1,427** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **$9.0\%$** | **Conservative/Reasonable.** Reflects the company's relatively stable, recurring revenue stream in a mature industry (Fintech/Banking Technology) combined with a moderate debt load. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | **$2.0\%$** | **Very Conservative/Maturity Rate.** Set below global GDP growth and the projected 2030 revenue growth ($2.37\%$). This assumes FIS's core business settles into a stable, highly mature maintenance/upgrade cycle long-term. |

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Discount Factor is calculated as $1 / (1 + \text{Discount Rate})^n$, where $n$ is the number of years from the present.

| Year ($n$) | Cash Flow (Net Income, $A$) | Discount Factor ($9.0\%$) | NPV of Cash Flow ($A \times \text{DF}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (n=1)** | $\$$928 | $0.9174$ | $\$$851 |
| **2026 (n=2)** | $\$$1,033 | $0.8417$ | $\$$869 |
| **2027 (n=3)** | $\$$1,131 | $0.7722$ | $\$$873 |
| **2028 (n=4)** | $\$$1,229 | $0.7084$ | $\$$871 |
| **2029 (n=5)** | $\$$1,327 | $0.6499$ | $\$$862 |
| **2030 (n=6)** | $\$$1,427 | $0.5963$ | $\$$851 |
| **Sum of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | | | **$\$$5,177** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value is the projected value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Terminal Growth Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Terminal Growth Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$$1,427 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$$1,455.54}{0.07} = \$$20,793 \text{ million}
$$

**NPV of Terminal Value (Discounted to Present):**

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{n=6}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \$$20,793 \times 0.5963 = \$$12,400 \text{ million}
$$

### Enterprise Value

$$
\text{Enterprise Value} = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}
$$

$$
\text{Enterprise Value} = \$$5,177 + \$$12,400 = \$$17,577 \text{ million}
$$

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$
\text{Equity Value} = \text{Enterprise Value} + \text{Total Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Equity Value} = \$$17,577 + \$$581 - \$$12,900 = \$$5,258 \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$$5,258 \text{ million}}{522.38 \text{ million shares}} = \$$10.06
$$

---

## Conclusion and Justification

### **Fair Value of FIS Stock (DCF Model): $\$$10.06**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$\$$10.06** |
| **Current Market Price (Oct 24, 2025)** | **$\$$67.52** |

### Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Value

The calculated Fair Value of $\$$10.06 is approximately $85\%$ lower than the current market price of $\$$67.52. This massive discrepancy signals that the market is making a fundamental assumption about the company's future that is *diametrically opposed* to the structure of the conservative DCF model used, as dictated by the constraints.

**The Market's Assumptions (Why the stock is $\$$67.52):**

The market is overwhelmingly pricing FIS based on the announced, high-value, transformative transactions, which were explicitly *excluded* from the core DCF model to adhere to the instruction's strict financial inputs.

1.  **Post-Acquisition Business Profile:** The market is valuing the **Pro Forma FIS**, which will include the Global Payments' Issuer Solutions business (the $\$$12 billion net acquisition). This deal, expected to close in H1 2026, significantly increases FIS's revenue base, creates a more focused "pure-play" banking and capital markets tech company, and is expected to drive higher profits and cash flow immediately. The market sees a much larger and more profitable business model starting in 2026.
2.  **Increased Debt is Covered by EBITDA/Cash Flow:** While the acquisition will be funded by approximately $\$$8 billion of new debt, the market believes the increased EBITDA and cash flow from the acquired business will justify the debt and allow the company to deleverage quickly to its $2.8x$ target. The market's Enterprise Value for the pro-forma entity is much higher, easily absorbing the new debt.
3.  **Future Cash Flow Conversion:** Management has guided for $82\%$ to $85\%$ cash conversion. The market is factoring in this significant improvement in the quality and quantity of future free cash flow, which is a stronger, less-leveraged multiple than what a GAAP Net Income DCF (even with a conservative ROIC) can capture.

**Why the DCF's Fair Value is $\$$10.06 (The Conservative Constraints):**

1.  **Exclusion of Major Acquisition:** The largest cause of the low valuation is the strict adherence to valuing only the **current continuing operations** (Banking + Capital Markets) through 2030, while using the $12.9 billion **current total debt** for the final equity calculation. The $12.9 billion debt is a heavy burden on a projected Enterprise Value of only $17.6$ billion from the current, smaller core business.
2.  **Debt Misalignment:** The instruction mandates using the $\$$12.9 billion in **current total debt** but does not allow for adding the future earnings from the $\$$12 billion acquired asset (the GPN Issuer Solutions business). In effect, the model applies a large debt from the current balance sheet *against the earnings stream of a much smaller business*, which is financially inconsistent with a true Pro-Forma valuation.

**Conclusion:**

The market is valuing FIS based on the expected outcome of its announced strategic transformation, which dramatically increases its future earnings and deleveraging potential. The model's $\$$10.06 Fair Value is an artificially low figure driven by the conservative constraint to **exclude the future financial benefits of the announced acquisition (a material event) while subtracting the large current debt balance against the small, pre-growth earnings of the remaining business.** The market correctly anticipates that the post-transaction Enterprise Value is far higher.
