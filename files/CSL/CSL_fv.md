### II. Business Engine and Future Projections

Carlisle's business is centered on being a "pure-play building products company", with its primary segments being Construction Materials (CCM) and Weatherproofing Technologies (CWT). The core of its growth is driven by **Vision 2030**, which leverages three major trends: **energy-efficiency, labor-savings, and the re-roofing cycle**.

The business engine assumptions are built directly on management's explicitly stated Vision 2030 targets:

| Metric | Management Vision 2030 Target | Valuation Assumption | Justification (Conservative Approach) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organic Revenue CAGR** | 5%+ | **Ramp from 3.0% to 5.0%** | The 2026 guidance is "low single-digit". I assume 3.0% for 2026 due to current macroeconomic headwinds (soft new construction). I conservatively ramp to 5.0% by 2028, slightly below the "5%+" target, to account for potential market cyclicality. |
| **Adjusted ROIC** | 25%+ | **20.0%** | I use a very conservative 20.0%, which is significantly below the 25%+ target and 2025 actual of ~25%, ensuring the valuation is conservative. |
| **Net Income Margin** | Aligned with 25%+ EBITDA Margin | **Ramp from 15.0% to 17.0%** | The 2025 GAAP Net Income Margin was 14.76%. Management is targeting cost cuts (1%-2% of revenue annually) and operational excellence. I conservatively project an improvement to 17.0% by 2030, a modest increase over five years, even with the high EBITDA margin target. |

#### A. Revenue Projections (in millions USD)

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | N/A | $5,019.9 | 2025 10-K |
| **2026** | 3.0% | $5,170.5 | Conservative "low single-digit" guidance. |
| **2027** | 4.0% | $5,377.3 | Moderate ramp-up as new construction recovers and re-roofing remains strong. |

| **2029** | 5.0% | $5,928.5 | Maintaining the 5%+ organic growth target. |
| **2030** | 5.0% | $6,225.0 | Maintaining the 5%+ organic growth target. |

#### B. Net Income Projections (in millions USD)

The projected Net Income follows the rule:
$NI_n = (Revenue_n * NI\_Margin_n) + (Cash\ from\ NI_{n-1} * ROIC)$

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | NI from Rev (B=A*NI Margin) | Cash from NI (n-1) | Assumed ROIC | ROIC Income (C) | Projected Net Income (B+C) | Cumulative Cash from NI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $5,019.9 | 14.76% | $740.7 | N/A | N/A | N/A | $740.7 | $740.7 |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### A. DCF Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative WACC estimate, higher than a typical cost of equity for a mature industrial company like CSL (which has a low-beta, high ROIC, and dividend history), but reasonable given the current interest rate environment and a margin of safety.
*   **Perpetuity Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** **2.5%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting the expected long-term GDP growth and inflation for a mature building products company, well below the 5%+ growth target.

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (n) | Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (1 / 1.09^n) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $923.7 | 0.9174 | $847.5 |
| **2027** | $1,166.4 | 0.8417 | $981.8 |
| **2028** | $1,469.6 | 0.7722 | $1,134.7 |
| **2029** | $1,838.3 | 0.7084 | $1,302.2 |
| **2030** | $2,286.0 | 0.6499 | $1,485.6 |
| **Sum of Explicit Period Cash Flows** | | | **$5,751.8** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the present value of all cash flows after 2030.

$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{ \text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g}) }{ (\text{WACC} - \text{g}) } $$

$$ \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{ \$2,286.0 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.025) }{ (0.090 - 0.025) } = \$36,137.9 \text{ million} $$

$$ \text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} $$

$$ \text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \$36,137.9 \text{ million} \times 0.6499 = \$23,485.6 \text{ million} $$

#### D. Total Equity Value

| Component | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of Explicit Period NPV (2026-2030) | $5,751.8 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $23,485.6 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **$29,237.4** |
| (+) Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $1,112.1 |
| (-) Total Debt | $2,881.6 |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **$27,467.9** |

---

### IV. Fair Value Per Share

$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{ \text{Total Fair Equity Value} }{ \text{Shares Outstanding} } $$

$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{ \$27,467.9 \text{ million} }{ 40,883,868 \text{ shares} } $$

$$ \text{Fair Value Per Share} = \$671.93 $$

### V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$671.93** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$409.04** (As of Feb 13, 2026) |
| **Market's Implied Discount** | **39.2%** |

**Justification for Disparity:**

My calculated Fair Value of **$671.93** is significantly higher than the current market price of **$409.04**. This implies the market is making far more conservative assumptions than even my conservatively-built model, which already accounts for a material haircut on management's official targets.

The market's assumptions appear to be discounting the following:

1.  **Skepticism on Vision 2030 Execution:** The market is likely unconvinced that CSL can consistently achieve the "5%+ Organic Revenue CAGR" and "25%+ ROIC" targets. The recent **softness in new construction** creates a near-term headwind, and the market may be projecting a lower long-term growth rate (e.g., closer to 3.0-3.5%) and a lower ROIC (e.g., closer to 15%) throughout the 2026-2030 period.
2.  **Higher Discount Rate / Risk Premium:** The market is likely applying a higher required rate of return (Discount Rate) than my assumed 9.0%. Given the cyclical nature of the construction industry, a higher discount rate (e.g., 10-11%) would significantly reduce the NPV, reflecting a higher perceived risk of an economic downturn impacting construction.
3.  **Lower Terminal Growth:** The market may be assuming a lower perpetual growth rate, perhaps closer to 1.5% to 2.0%, due to concerns about the long-term saturation of the re-roofing market or competitive pressure.
4.  **Reversion to the Mean:** The market may believe that the exceptionally high ROIC of **~25%** is unsustainable over the long run and will revert to a lower industry average, and thus they do not credit the high ROIC-driven income component in my model.

If I were to adjust the model to align with a market price of $409.04 (assuming the same initial financials and projections), it would require a significantly lower total equity value. This would necessitate a combination of:

*   **Aggressively Lower ROIC:** Lowering the ROIC assumption from 20.0% to a much lower figure, or
*   **Significantly Higher Discount Rate:** Increasing the discount rate from 9.0% to a rate that reflects high-risk.

My model's strong divergence is due to the conservative but explicit use of management's high-conviction targets (5.0% growth, 20.0% ROIC) which are substantially better than a typical industrial company, and which the market is clearly not fully pricing in due to execution risk. **My valuation assumes CSL successfully executes on its Vision 2030 plan to become a best-in-class industrial pure-play, which the current market price is skeptical of.**
