### II. Business Engine & Key Assumptions

The valuation is built upon management's **Vision 2030** strategic plan and the underlying business drivers:

#### 1. Business Engine Justification
Carlisle Companies (CSL) has transformed into a pure-play building products company, with its core business driven by the resilient and recurring commercial reroofing market, which accounts for approximately 70% of the Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) segment's commercial roofing business.

*   **Drivers:** The need for **energy efficiency** in an aging commercial building stock and government/mandated regulations create a durable, multi-year demand runway for high-performance building envelope solutions. Growth is supplemented by strategic acquisitions and the goal of deriving 25% of revenue from new products introduced within the last five years.
*   **Management's "Truth" (Vision 2030 Targets):**
    *   Organic Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of **>5%**.
    *   Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **25%**.
    *   Adjusted EBITDA Margin of **25%** (Implied from the EPS goal and prior performance).

#### 2. Revenue Projections

| Year | Rationale | Projected Revenue Growth | Projected Revenue (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | Baseline revenue from 10-K. | N/A | $5,003.6 |
| **2025** | Management guidance revised to **Low Single-Digit (LSD)** growth due to challenges in new construction and pricing headwinds. A conservative 2.0% is used. | **2.0%** | $5,103.7$ |
| **2026** | A conservative jump to the Vision 2030 target plus a small amount for accretive M&A. **6.0%** is a reasonable estimate, slightly above the >5% organic target. | **6.0%** | $5,409.9$ |
| **2027** | Steady execution against the Vision 2030 target, driven by the recurring reroofing cycle and acquisitions. | **6.0%** | $5,734.5$ |
| **2028** | Continued execution on Vision 2030 organic and M&A growth. | **6.0%** | $6,078.6$ |
| **2029** | Final year before the 2030 target is met. | **5.5%** | $6,413.5$ |
| **2030** | Hitting the target year. | **5.0%** | $6,734.2$ |

#### 3. Margin Projections (Net Income)

*   **2024 Net Income Margin (Baseline):** $865.1M / $5,003.6M = 17.3\%$
*   **2025 Net Income Margin:** Management guided a **150 bps decline in adjusted EBITDA margin** for 2025. To be conservative, I will project the Net Income Margin to contract to **16.0%** (a 130 bps contraction), reflecting the difficult construction environment and deleverage.
*   **2026 - 2030 Net Income Margin:** As the business engine normalizes and management executes toward the **25% ROIC** and **25% Adj. EBITDA Margin** targets, I will conservatively assume a sustained Net Income Margin of **17.5%**, which is slightly above the 2024 margin and in line with the long-term profitability goals.

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for each year is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) to Equity, as per the valuation instruction. The additional income from the prior year's accumulated cash (as a proxy for reinvested earnings) is calculated using the conservative management-guided long-term **ROIC of 25%**.

$Net\ Income_n = (\text{Revenue}_n \times \text{Net Income Margin}_n) + (\text{Prior Year's Accumulated Cash} \times \text{ROIC})$

$Prior\ Year's\ Accumulated\ Cash = \text{Cash}_{n-1} + \text{Net Income}_{n-1}$

*   **Initial Cash (End of 2024):** $753.5$ million (from Q2 2025 10-Q, Cash at Dec 31, 2024)
*   **ROIC (Reinvestment Rate):** 25.0% (Management's Vision 2030 target).
*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** 9.0% (Conservative, reasonable rate for a well-established company in the building products industry).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3.0% (Conservative assumption for growth in perpetuity, below US GDP long-term trend, reflecting a mature business model).

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Net Income from Ops (C = A * B) | Prior Year's Cash (D) | ROIC on Cash (E = D * 25.0%) | Projected Net Income (C + E) | NPV of Net Income (Discounted at 9.0%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $5,103.7$ | 16.0% | $816.6$ | $753.5$ | $188.4$ | $1,005.0$ | $922.0$ |
| **2026** | $5,409.9$ | 17.5% | $946.7$ | $1,758.5$ | $439.6$ | $1,386.3$ | $1,164.8$ |
| **2027** | $5,734.5$ | 17.5% | $1,003.5$ | $3,144.8$ | $786.2$ | $1,789.7$ | $1,379.8$ |
| **2028** | $6,078.6$ | 17.5% | $1,063.8$ | $4,934.5$ | $1,233.6$ | $2,297.4$ | $1,625.3$ |
| **2029** | $6,413.5$ | 17.5% | $1,122.4$ | $7,231.9$ | $1,808.0$ | $2,930.4$ | $1,900.5$ |
| **2030** | $6,734.2$ | 17.5% | $1,178.5$ | $10,162.3$ | $2,540.6$ | $3,719.1$ | $2,217.4$ |

*All currency figures in millions USD.*
*Note on Prior Year's Cash (D):* For 2026, $D$ is $753.5$ (Initial Cash) + $1,005.0$ (2025 Net Income).

#### 4. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value ($TV$) is calculated using the perpetuity growth method from the final year's projected cash flow (2030 Net Income).

$TV = \frac{Net\ Income_{2030}\ \times (1\ +\ \text{Terminal Growth Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate}\ -\ \text{Terminal Growth Rate}} = \frac{\$3,719.1 \times (1\ +\ 0.03)}{0.09\ -\ 0.03} = \frac{\$3,830.7}{\ 0.06} = \$63,845.0\ \text{Million}$

$NPV\ of\ TV = \frac{TV}{(1\ +\ \text{Discount Rate})^{Years}} = \frac{\$63,845.0}{(1\ +\ 0.09)^6} = \$38,054.4\ \text{Million}$

#### 5. Net Present Value (NPV) and Equity Value

*   **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** $922.0 + 1,164.8 + 1,379.8 + 1,625.3 + 1,900.5 + 2,217.4 = **\$9,209.8\ \text{Million}**$
*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** NPV of Projected Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value
    $TEV = \$9,209.8\ \text{Million} + \$38,054.4\ \text{Million} = **\$47,264.2\ \text{Million}**$
*   **Equity Value:** TEV + Total Cash - Total Debt
    $Equity\ Value = \$47,264.2\ \text{Million} + \$68.4\ \text{Million} - \$1,895.8\ \text{Million} = **\$45,436.8\ \text{Million}**$

### IV. Fair Value and Market Comparison

**Fair Value per Share Calculation:**

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$45,436.8\ \text{Million}}{42.56\ \text{Million Shares}} = \mathbf{\$1,067.59\ \text{per Share}}$$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$1,067.59** |
| **Current Market Price** | **~$341.01** |
| **Difference** | **+213%** |

#### Justification for the Difference

The calculated Fair Value of **$1,067.59** is significantly higher (over 200%) than the current market price of approximately $341.01. This large discrepancy is primarily a consequence of the rigid rules provided for the valuation, specifically the instruction on how to treat the Net Income and ROIC:

$$\text{Net Income}_n = \text{Net Income from Operations}_n + (\text{Prior Year's Accumulated Cash} \times \text{ROIC})$$

The instruction forces a compounding effect on all generated net income, treating it as if it were a risk-free asset compounding at an aggressive **25% ROIC** (the management's long-term operational target) for a full six years (2025-2030).

**The Market's Assumptions (Why the Fair Value is Too High):**

1.  **Reinvestment/ROIC Assumption is Too Aggressive:** The market does **not** assume the company can deploy 100% of its retained earnings (Net Income) and continuously earn a super-normal **25% ROIC** on this ever-growing cash pile. An ROIC of 25% is a target for the *entire business* (Invested Capital), not for the returns on a rapidly compounding "cash hoard." The market assumes a more realistic reinvestment rate, one that includes a portion for return *to* shareholders (dividends, buybacks, as evidenced by the $700 million in repurchases in 2025) and a portion for capital expenditures or lower-return acquisitions.
2.  **DCF/Cash Flow Proxy is Overstated:** By using Net Income (a measure of profitability) as the sole proxy for cash flow and then re-investing it at 25%, the model severely overstates the actual Free Cash Flow that is available to be distributed to shareholders or to grow the business *without* additional capital raises. In reality, FCF is typically lower than Net Income due to working capital needs and capital expenditures. CSL's FCF margin target is **>15%**, which is more conservative than the 16.0%-17.5% Net Income Margin used.
3.  **Terminal Value Inflation:** The aggressive ROIC assumption inflates the projected Net Income for 2030 to an extremely high level ($3.7 billion), which is the basis for the terminal value, leading to a severely inflated NPV for the terminal value ($38 billion).

**Conclusion:** The calculated fair value of **$1,067.59** represents the theoretical value of CSL's stock if it could perpetually re-invest 100% of its net income at a 25% ROIC, which is not a realistic long-term assumption for a mature company. The market is making the more sensible assumption that the majority of earnings will be either returned to shareholders or re-invested at a lower, more sustainable rate, justifying its much lower valuation.
