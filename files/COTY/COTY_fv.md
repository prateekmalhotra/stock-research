## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (FY2026 - FY2031)

### Business Engine and Growth Drivers

Coty's business is split into two divisions: **Prestige Beauty** (approx. 68% of sales) and **Consumer Beauty** (approx. 32% of sales).

1.  **Prestige Beauty (The Growth Engine):**
    *   **Driver:** Fragrance remains the primary growth driver, benefiting from the long-term "fragrance index" trend (increased usage by Gen Z, men, etc.). From FY2021-FY2025, Prestige fragrance delivered a 10% Net Revenue CAGR.
    *   **Strategy:** Continued launch of "blockbuster" innovations and diversification (e.g., Burberry Goddess, Kylie Cosmic).
    *   **Headwind/Conservatism:** Recent market data shows a moderation in Prestige fragrance growth (low-to-mid single-digit rate in Q2 FY2026). The growth is also vulnerable to retailer destocking and promotional environments.

2.  **Consumer Beauty (The Turnaround/Stabilizer):**
    *   **Driver:** Turnaround through restructuring, focusing on core brands (CoverGirl, Max Factor, Rimmel), and expanding in high-growth channels like e-commerce.
    *   **Strategy:** New "Coty. Curated." strategic framework for sharper priorities, improved execution, and continued portfolio review. Management is implementing a fixed cost reduction plan.
    *   **Headwind/Conservatism:** This segment continues to face strong headwinds, with LFL revenue declining 8% in the first half of FY2026, driven by channel shifts and competitive pressure.

### Revenue Projection Assumptions (FY2026 - FY2031)

The company expects a return to net revenue growth in the second half of FY2026. We must be conservative, reflecting recent market deceleration and ongoing challenges in Consumer Beauty.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | YoY Growth (LFL) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Base)** | $5,900.0 | -3.7% | Actual revenue (approx.). |
| **FY2026** | $5,959.0 | 1.0% | Conservative, reflecting H1 decline (6% LFL decline) and H2 return to low-single-digit growth (management's expectation). |
| **FY2027** | $6,257.0 | 5.0% | Reflects a full year of the "Coty. Curated." strategic framework and a more stable market. Consistent with management's target to grow *ahead* of the beauty market (which has historically grown mid-single digits). |
| **FY2028** | $6,507.3 | 4.0% | Continued strong Prestige growth, but a conservative moderation of overall growth as Consumer Beauty stabilization is assumed to take time. |
| **FY2029** | $6,702.5 | 3.0% | Growth rate moderates, reflecting the long-term historical rate of the overall beauty market and a conservative estimate of Coty's potential long-term outperformance. |
| **FY2030** | $6,836.5 | 2.0% | Further moderation toward a conservative long-term growth rate for a mature beauty company. |
| **FY2031** | $6,904.9 | 1.0% | Terminal year growth rate used for final cash flow calculation. |

## III. Margin and Net Income Projections

### Margin Assumptions

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 - FY2027 | FY2028 - FY2031 | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adjusted Gross Margin %** | 64.9% | 65.5% | 66.0% | Management's stated goal is to exceed 65%. We conservatively project gradual expansion (50-60 bps) driven by cost savings, pricing, and mix shift toward higher-margin Prestige products. |
| **Net Income Margin %** | -6.2% | 3.0% | 4.0% | Coty has been unprofitable (FY2025 Net Loss of -$367.9M). Management is guiding for profitability and margin expansion. We assume a major rebound toward a conservative 3.0% in FY2026, driven by the $80M fixed cost reduction plan, improving to a conservative 4.0% thereafter, which is significantly below industry leaders. |
| **ROIC % on Cash** | N/A | 5.0% | 5.0% | Past ROIC is distorted by losses and restructuring. We assume a conservative, positive **5.0%** ROIC on the accumulated cash balance, per instruction. This is a reasonable baseline return for productive capital reinvestment in a profitable business. |

### Projected Net Income Calculation (following user's specific rules)

**Rule:** Net Income for next year = (Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions) + (ROIC from net income got from previous year/Accumulated Cash).

| Fiscal Year (FY) | Projected Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | Previous Acc. Cash (B) | ROIC on Cash (C = B * 5.0%) | Projected Cash Flow (A + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | $5,900.0 | -6.2% | -$367.9 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **2026** | $5,959.0 | 3.0% | $178.8 | $436.7 | $21.8 | **$200.6** |
| **2027** | $6,257.0 | 3.0% | $187.7 | $637.3 | $31.9 | **$219.6** |
| **2028** | $6,507.3 | 4.0% | $260.3 | $856.9 | $42.8 | **$303.1** |
| **2029** | $6,702.5 | 4.0% | $268.1 | $1,159.9 | $58.0 | **$326.1** |
| **2030** | $6,836.5 | 4.0% | $273.5 | $1,486.0 | $74.3 | **$347.8** |
| **2031** | $6,904.9 | 4.0% | $276.2 | $1,833.8 | $91.7 | **$367.9** |

*Notes:*
*   *FY2026 Previous Acc. Cash (B) is $436.7M (Current Cash & Equivalents on the balance sheet).*
*   *Subsequent Acc. Cash (B) is calculated as: Previous Year's Acc. Cash + Previous Year's Projected Cash Flow (A + C).*

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a conservative (higher) discount rate of **10.0%**. This reflects the company's recent volatile financial performance (e.g., net losses, leadership change, declining LFL sales in Q2 FY2026) and a complex turnaround story.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** We will use a very conservative perpetual growth rate of **1.5%**. This is below the long-term expected global economic growth and reflects that while the beauty market is resilient, Coty operates in a mature, highly competitive industry.

### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) is the value of all cash flows beyond the projection period (FY2031).

$TV_{2031} = (Cash Flow_{2031} * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)$

$TV_{2031} = ($367.9 \text{ Million} * (1 + 0.015)) / (0.10 - 0.015)$

$TV_{2031} = $373.4 \text{ Million} / 0.085$

**$TV_{2031} = $4,392.9 \text{ Million}$**

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) is the sum of the present values of the projected cash flows and the Terminal Value.

| Year (n) | Projected Cash Flow | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + WACC)^n) | Present Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $200.6 | 0.9091 | $182.4 |
| **2027** | $219.6 | 0.8264 | $181.5 |
| **2028** | $303.1 | 0.7513 | $227.7 |
| **2029** | $326.1 | 0.6830 | $222.7 |
| **2030** | $347.8 | 0.6209 | $215.9 |
| **2031** | $367.9 | 0.5645 | $207.6 |
| **TV in 2031** | $4,392.9 | 0.5645 | $2,480.1 |
| **Total NPV** | | | **$3,717.9** |

## V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value of Stock Calculation

The Fair Value of the Stock is calculated using the following formula:

$Fair Value = (\text{Total NPV} + \text{Current Cash} - \text{Total Debt}) / \text{Shares Outstanding}$

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Future Cash Flows | $3,717.9 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $436.7 |
| Less: Total Debt | $3,038.1 |
| **Equity Value** | **$1,116.5** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | $880.0$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$1.27** |

### Conclusion and Justification

*   **Calculated Fair Value:** **$1.27 per share**
*   **Current Stock Price:** $\sim$**$10.00 per share** (as of the current date approximation)

The calculated Fair Value of **$1.27** is significantly lower than the current market price of approximately **$10.00**.

**Justification for the Divergence:**

The primary reason for the large difference is the highly conservative nature of the assumptions, particularly when using **Net Income (plus an ROIC component)** as the proxy for cash flow instead of the more standard **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)** or **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**.

1.  **Proxy for Cash Flow (Net Income vs. FCFE):**
    *   **The Model's Constraint:** The instruction to use *Net Income* as the cash flow proxy is highly restrictive for a company like Coty. Net Income is burdened by non-cash, non-recurring items (like large amortization, impairment, or restructuring charges) and does not fully capture the operating cash generation available to equity holders. Coty is aggressively deleveraging, which is reflected in a high Total Debt figure but is obscured in a Net Income-based DCF.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** The market is likely valuing Coty based on its **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**, which management guides to be strong and growing. FCF typically excludes the volatile non-cash charges and reflects the cash available for debt repayment and shareholders. In Q2 FY2026, Coty reported a significant **$524 million** of Free Cash Flow in the first half of the fiscal year. A model based on FCF would yield a much higher valuation.

2.  **Conservative Margin Assumptions:**
    *   The projected Net Income Margin of 4.0% (FY2028 onwards) is conservative. If the market believes Coty can reach a mid-single-digit Net Income margin (e.g., 6% to 7%) within the next few years by successfully executing its turnaround and capitalizing on the high-margin Prestige segment, the equity value would dramatically increase.

3.  **Wella Divestiture Cash/Debt Paydown:**
    *   The model uses the recent cash balance ($436.7M) and total debt ($3,038.1M) as of 12/31/2025. This debt figure is after the cash proceeds from the remaining Wella stake sale were used to reduce debt and leverage. This deleveraging effort is the **key driver** for the stock's current valuation, as a lower net debt profile significantly reduces risk and increases the value of future FCF to equity holders, a factor not fully captured by the model's Net Income proxy.

**Conclusion:** The market's implied valuation of approximately $10.00 per share is based on the expectation that Coty's operational restructuring will succeed, leading to consistent positive **Free Cash Flow** generation and further **deleveraging**, which would support a significantly higher intrinsic value than the one calculated using a conservative Net Income-based model. The market is pricing in the successful execution of the turnaround, while the model is constrained by conservative assumptions on a Net Income basis, which currently understates the company's cash-generating potential.

**Fair Value of Coty Inc. Stock (Per Share): $1.27**
