### **II. Business Engine & Revenue Forecast (FY2026 - FY2030)**

The core business engine for Coty is driven by its **Prestige** segment (fragrances, cosmetics, skincare) and its **Consumer Beauty** segment (mass fragrances, skincare). The management's strategy, "All-In to Win," is focused on premiumization, innovation, and global expansion, particularly in the high-growth Prestige category.

#### **Revenue Assumptions (FY2026 - FY2030)**

Management has guided for a **medium-term Like-for-Like (LFL) revenue growth of +6% to +8%**, and they expect FY2026 results to align with this algorithm. [cite: 8 (from Step 1), 4 (from Step 2)] The growth is attributed to:
1.  **Premiumization:** Driving higher-margin Prestige sales, which has consistently outperformed the market. The Prestige business grew 13% LFL in Q3 FY24 and 17% LFL year-to-date FY24. [cite: 1 (from Step 1)]
2.  **Geographic Focus:** Double-digit growth in "growth engine" markets and mid-single-digit growth in mature markets. [cite: 4 (from Step 2)]
3.  **Innovation & Pricing:** New product launches and a blend of volume and price/mix effects supporting growth. [cite: 6 (from Step 1)]

To maintain a **conservative but reasonable** projection, I will use the lower end of the management's medium-term guidance and then conservatively decelerate the growth rate.

| Fiscal Year | LFL Revenue Growth Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026** | **+6.0%** | Lower end of management's medium-term +6% to +8% LFL growth target. [cite: 8 (from Step 1), 4 (from Step 2)] |
| **FY2027** | **+5.5%** | Conservative slight deceleration as the market normalizes, but still benefiting from "All-In to Win" and share reduction target milestone in FY27. |
| **FY2028** | **+5.0%** | Continued premiumization and market share gains, but slowing as the transformation matures. |
| **FY2029** | **+4.0%** | Decelerating towards a long-term stable growth rate for a global beauty company. |
| **FY2030** | **+3.0%** | Settling into a conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting the expected stable growth of the mature beauty market. |

### **III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projection (FY2026 - FY2030)**

#### **Margin and Expense Assumptions**

1.  **Adjusted Gross Margin (GM):** FY2025 Adjusted GM was 64.9% with management guiding for continued margin expansion. I will use a conservative **65.0%** for all future years, reflecting the stabilization of premiumization benefits and cost savings. [cite: 7 (from Step 2)]
2.  **Adjusted Operating Margin (OM):** FY2025 Adjusted OM was 14.5%. Management expects continued margin expansion. I will use **15.0%** to reflect the benefits of the "All-In to Win" program and fixed cost reductions (expected in FY2026/FY2027). [cite: 7, 4 (from Step 2)]
3.  **Net Interest Expense:** Management guided for Net Interest Expense of **\$225.0 million** (mid-point of low to mid \$200 million) for FY2025, which should decrease over time as the company deleverages. I will keep it flat for FY2026/FY2027 and then conservatively drop it by 5% per year. [cite: 29 (from Step 1)]
4.  **Tax Rate:** Management guided for a stable Adjusted Effective Tax Rate of **29%** for FY2025 and beyond. [cite: 29 (from Step 1)]
5.  **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Past reported ROIC has been near 4.00% (or negative in reported GAAP numbers). Since future cash flow is projected to be positive, I will apply a **conservative 5.0% ROIC** to the previous year's retained Net Income, in line with the instruction to use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC. [cite: 19 (from Step 1)]
6.  **Net Income to Cash Flow:** Net Income is assumed to go directly into cash, per the instruction.

#### **Projected Net Income Calculation (in millions)**

| Metric | FY2025 | FY2026 | FY2027 | FY2028 | FY2029 | FY2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Net Revenue** | \$5,892.9 | \$6,246.5 | \$6,589.9 | \$6,919.4 | \$7,196.2 | \$7,411.1 |
| **B. Operating Income (15.0% of A)** | \$854.4* | \$936.9 | \$988.5 | \$1,037.9 | \$1,079.4 | \$1,111.7 |
| **C. Net Interest Expense** | \$225.0 | \$225.0 | \$225.0 | \$213.8 | \$203.1 | \$193.0 |
| **D. Pre-Tax Income (B-C)** | \$629.4 | \$711.9 | \$763.5 | \$824.1 | \$876.3 | \$918.7 |
| **E. Income Tax (29% of D)** | \$182.5 | \$206.5 | \$221.4 | \$239.0 | \$254.1 | \$266.4 |
| **F. Net Income (D-E) - Base** | \$446.9 | \$505.4 | \$542.1 | \$585.1 | \$622.2 | \$652.3 |
| **G. ROIC from Prior Year (5.0%)** | N/A | \$22.3 | \$25.3 | \$27.1 | \$29.3 | \$31.1 |
| **H. Total Net Income (F+G)** | \$446.9 | **\$527.7** | **\$567.4** | **\$612.2** | **\$651.5** | **\$683.4** |

*$5,892.9 (FY25 Revenue) * 14.5% (FY25 Adjusted Operating Margin) = $854.4 million. This is used for the FY2025 base Net Income calculation for FY2026 ROIC only, given the instruction to use management commentary.

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

#### **Rate Assumptions**

1.  **Discount Rate:** A **10.0%** discount rate is chosen. This is a conservative rate, higher than a typical cost of capital for a stable large-cap company, reflecting the historical volatility of Coty's business and its high debt load, which increases business risk.
2.  **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A **2.0%** perpetual growth rate is assumed. This is a very conservative rate, below the long-term historical GDP growth rate and below the projected FY2030 growth rate, which is appropriate for a mature, global consumer goods company.

#### **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (FY2026 - FY2030) (in millions)**

| Fiscal Year | Net Income (H) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026** | \$527.7 | 0.909 | \$480.0 |
| **FY2027** | \$567.4 | 0.826 | \$468.9 |
| **FY2028** | \$612.2 | 0.751 | \$459.7 |
| **FY2029** | \$651.5 | 0.683 | \$445.0 |
| **FY2030** | \$683.4 | 0.621 | \$424.4 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows (Sum)** | - | - | **\$2,278.0** |

#### **Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all future cash flows beyond FY2030.

$$ \text{TV} = \frac{\text{Net Income}_{\text{FY2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}} $$

$$ \text{TV} = \frac{\$683.4 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$697.1}{\$0.08} = \$8,713.8 $$

The Net Present Value of the Terminal Value is:

$$ \text{NPV}_{\text{TV}} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{FY2030}} $$

$$ \text{NPV}_{\text{TV}} = \$8,713.8 \times 0.621 = **\$5,411.3** $$

#### **V. Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source/Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Value of Future Cash Flows** | **\$7,689.3** | NPV of Projected Cash Flows (\$2,278.0) + NPV of Terminal Value (\$5,411.3) |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$257.1 | From Balance Sheet |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$4,008.4) | From Balance Sheet |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **\$3,938.0** | \$7,689.3 + \$257.1 - \$4,008.4 |
| **Current Shares Outstanding** | 873.86 million | From market data |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$4.51** | \$3,938.0 / 873.86 |

### **VI. Conclusion and Justification**

#### **Fair Value per Share**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$4.51** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$3.95** |
| **Implied Upside** | **+14.2%** |

#### **Justification of the Fair Value**

The calculated fair value of **\$4.51** per share suggests that Coty Inc. is **undervalued** by approximately 14.2% based on these conservative, management-backed projections.

The key drivers of this valuation are:

1.  **Conservative Revenue Model:** The 6% to 3% long-term growth is anchored to the low end of management's medium-term guidance of +6% to +8% LFL growth, which is supported by the sustained outperformance of its Prestige segment. The market might be assuming a steeper deceleration or less successful execution of the turnaround, particularly in the Consumer Beauty segment or in the challenging U.S. mass cosmetics market.
2.  **Margin Expansion:** The model incorporates modest, long-term margin expansion to a 15.0% Operating Margin, reflecting the continued benefits of the "All-In to Win" cost savings program and the positive mix shift towards the high-margin Prestige segment. The market may be discounting this margin expansion due to continued investments required in A&CP (Advertising, Consumption and Promotion) to support new product launches.
3.  **High Debt Load:** The significant $\$$4.0 billion in Total Debt is the primary factor limiting the fair value, as it must be subtracted directly from the total enterprise value. The valuation implicitly assumes the company successfully deleverages, leading to a reduced (but still material) Net Interest Expense, which is a key management goal.

The market price of $\$$3.95 is only **14.2%** lower than the calculated fair value. This suggests the market is largely in agreement with the company's financial trajectory but is likely applying a slightly higher risk premium (Discount Rate) or anticipating a less successful deleveraging and lower perpetual growth rate than the conservative assumptions used in this model. The market's assumptions could be:
*   **Higher Discount Rate:** The market may use a higher discount rate (e.g., 11% or 12%) due to geopolitical/macro risks and the historical instability of Coty's financials prior to the recent turnaround.
*   **Slower Deleveraging/Interest Expense:** A higher-than-\$225 million long-term interest expense would significantly compress Net Income and, consequently, the fair value.

The DCF model validates that Coty's stock is reasonably valued by the market, with a slight undervaluation based on a successful, but conservative, execution of its transformation plan and medium-term guidance.
