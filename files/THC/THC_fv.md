## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Tenet Healthcare's core business engine is its dual focus: **Ambulatory Care (USPI)** and **Hospital Operations and Services (HOS)**. The strategy is clearly driven by the expansion and performance of the higher-margin, asset-light USPI segment, which focuses on outpatient care (Ambulatory Surgery Centers - ASCs).

**Management Commentary & Internal Metrics (The Engine):**
*   **USPI is the Growth Driver:** Management has consistently highlighted USPI's outstanding performance, with a focus on same-facility revenue growth, high patient acuity, and favorable payer mix [cite: 4 in Step 3]. For Q3 2025, USPI same-facility system-wide revenues increased 8.3%, driven by a 6.1% increase in net revenue per case (acuity/payer mix) and a 2.1% increase in case volumes [cite: 4 in Step 3].
*   **Deleveraging & Focus:** The company has been aggressively reducing debt and transforming its portfolio by divesting less profitable, non-core hospitals, improving its leverage ratio (2.30x Net Debt/Adj. EBITDA at Q3 2025) [cite: 2, 7 in Step 2].
*   **Expense Management:** Consolidated Salary, Wages, and Benefits (SWB) as a percent of net revenues has been improving (41.7% in Q3 2025) [cite: 4 in Step 3].

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Margin Justification | Net Income Margin |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **2025** | $21,156 | Full-year is projected using Q3 2025 revenue of $5,289M, assuming a slight acceleration in Q4 to account for raised EBITDA guidance [cite: 1, 4 in Step 3]. This is a **4.3%** growth over 2024 (using the prior $20.7B full-year 2024 revenue figure). | 4.8% |
| **2026** | $22,425 | **+6.0%** annual growth. This reflects the continued high-single-digit growth in USPI (est. 8.0%) and more moderate growth in the Hospital segment (est. 4.0%), driven by sustained volume, acuity, and de novo expansion. | 5.3% |
| **2027** | $23,763 | **+6.0%** annual growth. Assumes the USPI growth engine continues at a similar pace, with market share gains in the outpatient setting. | 5.5% |
| **2028** | $24,951 | **+5.0%** annual growth. Introduction of conservatism, assuming market saturation and price pressure in certain segments begin to moderate growth. | 5.5% |
| **2029** | $26,198 | **+5.0%** annual growth. Continued moderation as the benefit of portfolio transformation slows. | 5.5% |
| **2030** | $27,246 | **+4.0%** annual growth. Further conservative decline in the growth rate, approaching a maturity rate for the terminal value. | 5.5% |

**Net Income Margin Justification:**
*   Net Income available to common shareholders was $342M on $5,289M revenue for Q3 2025, implying a 6.5% margin. Full-year 2025 net income is $1,151M from Q1-Q3 [cite: 1, 5 in Step 3], which leads to a run rate margin of over 5.0%.
*   The model assumes a **conservative base Net Income Margin of 4.8% in 2025**, which is lower than the Q3 run-rate to account for potential non-recurring benefits and conservative forecasting. This margin then **expands modestly to 5.5% by 2027** and remains flat, reflecting the increased proportion of higher-margin USPI revenue and improved cost structure mentioned by management [cite: 4 in Step 3].

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

The valuation uses a conservative two-stage DCF model:
1.  **Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030):** Net Income is used as a proxy for unlevered free cash flow available to equity holders.
2.  **Terminal Value (2031 onwards):** Projected using a conservative perpetuity growth rate.

### ROIC Assumption and Net Income Calculation

The model incorporates the rule: *Net income for next year = Net income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

*   **ROIC Assumption:** THC has historically had volatile and often high reported returns due to asset sales. Given the recent focus on the high-margin USPI segment, a conservative, yet reasonable, **ROIC of 10.0%** is assumed for cash reinvestment. This is conservative for a business transforming to a higher-margin, asset-light model.

| Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC on Previous Year's Cash (B) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) | NPV Factor (12.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025** | $21,156 | 4.8% | $1,015 | $0 | $1,015 | 0.8929 | $906 |
| **2026** | $22,425 | 5.3% | $1,189 | $102 | $1,291 | 0.7972 | $1,029 |
| **2027** | $23,763 | 5.5% | $1,307 | $129 | $1,436 | 0.7118 | $1,022 |
| **2028** | $24,951 | 5.5% | $1,372 | $144 | $1,516 | 0.6355 | $963 |
| **2029** | $26,198 | 5.5% | $1,441 | $152 | $1,593 | 0.5674 | $904 |
| **2030** | $27,246 | 5.5% | $1,498 | $159 | $1,657 | 0.5066 | $839 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | | **$5,663** |

*Note: Net Income (A) is the Net Income for that year. ROIC on Previous Year's Cash (B) is 10.0% of the previous year's "Total Cash Flow." Values are in millions USD.*

### Terminal Value Calculation (2031 onwards)

*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative Perpetuity Growth Rate):** Healthcare spending is typically tied to GDP growth and inflation. A conservative, long-term real growth rate is essential. **2.5%** is used, significantly below the projected growth to ensure conservatism.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** Given the high debt-to-equity ratio and the cyclical nature of hospital and payor relationships, a higher discount rate is appropriate. A conservative (but reasonable) **12.0%** is used to reflect the risk.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Cash Flow (2030)** | $1,657 million |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | 12.0% |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | 2.5% |
| **Terminal Value in 2030** | $1,657 / (0.120 - 0.025) = $17,442 million |
| **NPV of Terminal Value (2030 Value Discounted to Today)** | $17,442 million * 0.5066 (2030 NPV Factor) = **$8,837 million** |

### Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | $5,663 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | $8,837 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $14,500 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $2,975 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $13,187 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$4,288** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 87.885 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $4,288 / 87.885 = **$48.79** |

## 4. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value of THC Stock: $48.79**

**Current Market Price: $207.73**

The calculated fair value of **$48.79** is dramatically lower than the current market price of **$207.73**. This substantial difference suggests that the market is making far more aggressive assumptions about Tenet's future growth and profitability than the conservative DCF model.

### Justification for the Discrepancy

The market is likely valuing Tenet based on its high-growth, high-margin subsidiary, **USPI (Ambulatory Care)**, and may be assigning a lower, or even zero/negative, value to the Hospital Operations and Services (HOS) segment, which carries the bulk of the debt. The market's assumptions appear to be:

**1. Aggressive USPI Growth and Valuation:**
*   The market may be applying a growth rate (g) for USPI far exceeding the 6.0% to 4.0% decline used in this model. USPI's same-facility revenue growth of 8.3% in Q3 2025 is very strong [cite: 4 in Step 3].
*   The market may be valuing USPI as a separate entity using a multiple of 15x-20x EBITDA, which is common for asset-light, fast-growing healthcare services. Given the $4.47B - $4.57B EBITDA guidance [cite: 2 in Step 2] and a portion of that being higher quality USPI EBITDA, this could justify a much higher enterprise value.
*   **Model's Conservative ROIC:** The 10.0% ROIC used for reinvestment is likely far too low for the high-performing USPI business, which is the focus of management's capital allocation. The market is likely modeling a higher ROIC.

**2. A More Optimistic Deleveraging and Debt Reduction Path:**
*   Management has a clear focus on deleveraging, reducing the Net Debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio to 2.30x at Q3 2025 [cite: 2 in Step 3]. The market may be assuming the company uses its free cash flow, which is guided to be high (\$2.275B - \$2.525B total free cash flow for 2025) [cite: 4 in Step 3], almost entirely for debt reduction or aggressive share buybacks, which quickly increases the equity value.
*   **Market's Implied Growth:** To justify a current price of $207.73, the market is essentially making one of the following assumptions:
    *   **A Perpetuity Growth Rate (g) of ~9.0%** (an unsustainable rate for a mature company).
    *   **A Net Income Margin of ~20%** (a significant, unsubstantiated jump from the current 5.5%).
    *   **Or, more likely, a rapid divestiture of the low-margin HOS segment at an attractive valuation**, immediately simplifying the business and leaving a "pure-play" USPI.

**3. The Model's Flaw (Based on the market's perspective):**
The model's key weakness is treating **Net Income as the proxy for total equity cash flow** and valuing the entire consolidated entity. The market, in contrast, is likely performing a **Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)** valuation:

*   **SOTP Estimate (Market's View):**
    *   **USPI (Ambulatory)**: Say 45% of total EBITDA (\$2.0B) @ 15x multiple = \$30.0 Billion.
    *   **HOS + Conifer (Hospitals & Services)**: Say 55% of total EBITDA (\$2.5B) @ 5x multiple = \$12.5 Billion.
    *   **Total Enterprise Value**: $42.5 Billion.
    *   **Equity Value**: $42.5B - $13.2B (Debt) + $3.0B (Cash) = $32.3 Billion.
    *   **Fair Value Per Share**: $32.3B / 87.885M shares = **$367.54 per share**. (This shows how aggressive the market's growth and multiple assumptions must be, as even this SOTP estimate with a 15x USPI multiple still exceeds the current stock price.)

**Final Justification:**
The DCF model is inherently conservative and suggests THC is significantly **overvalued** if its future growth is only moderate. However, the market believes that Tenet's ongoing portfolio transformation to the high-growth, high-margin USPI platform will generate a significantly higher proportion of future cash flow, justifying a much higher **Net Income Margin** and **Terminal Growth Rate** for the combined entity than a conservative historical model can support. The true fair value is likely between the extreme conservatism of the DCF (\$48.79) and an aggressive SOTP valuation, with the current price of **$207.73** reflecting a high degree of confidence in management's ability to execute this transformation and achieve a pure-play, high-multiple valuation for USPI.
