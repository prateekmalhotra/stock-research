## Business Summary

The York Water Company operates as a highly regulated public utility primarily serving residential homes, commercial businesses, and industrial users across York County and surrounding areas in Pennsylvania. The core business model is straightforward: the company owns, manages, and maintains the essential infrastructure, including reservoirs, water treatment plants, and thousands of miles of distribution pipes, necessary to deliver clean water and increasingly, manage wastewater. Because water is a critical service, the company is granted a virtual monopoly in its service territory. In return for this exclusivity, the rates charged to customers are strictly determined and approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC), ensuring the company earns a predictable, government-approved rate of return on its infrastructure investments.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for the company is regulatory lag. Since the government controls pricing, if the company's operating costs, such as labor and construction materials, rise quickly, the mandated process to get approval for a rate increase can take a year or more. This delay temporarily compresses earnings, a common threat utilities have faced historically. A long-term risk involves climate change and severe weather, which can lead to extended droughts that threaten the water supply, or extreme flooding that can damage critical infrastructure, both posing a greater concern now than in decades past. Furthermore, since the company constantly upgrades and replaces its aging network, high interest rates can significantly increase the cost of financing new projects, which must eventually be recovered from customers, potentially straining affordability and future growth opportunities.

## Company History

This history lesson on The York Water Company (YORW) is organized chronologically, explaining its founding, the challenges it faced, and the solutions that helped it become the oldest investor-owned utility in the United States.

***

### The York Water Company (YORW): A History from Inception to Present

#### **Part 1: The Founding and Early Years (The Inception)**

1.  **A Response to Fire Risk (1816):** The York Water Company was founded in 1816 by a group of local businessmen in York, Pennsylvania, who were primarily concerned with the constant threat of fire.
2.  **The Goal:** The town frequently faced devastating fires, and the traditional "bucket brigades" were proving inadequate; the new company's main goal was to establish a public water supply with sufficient pressure to help local fire companies control blazes.
3.  **A Pioneer in Utilities:** By issuing stock and forming a private company, YORW became the **oldest investor-owned utility** in the United States, operating continuously since its founding.
4.  **Simple Beginnings:** The very first piping system was constructed using logs that were bored out to create water mains, directing water from a spring to a reservoir and then into the town square.

#### **Part 2: Headwinds, Innovations, and Growth in the 19th Century**

5.  **Headwind: Urban Growth Outpaces Supply:** As the population and industry in York grew, the original spring water supply and log pipes quickly became insufficient for the town's increasing water needs.
6.  **Innovative Solution: Steam Power (1849):** To address the growing demand, the company built its first steam pumping station along the Codorus Creek to boost the water supply.
7.  **Headwind: Industrial Pollution and Disease:** By the late 1800s, industrial waste was polluting the Codorus Creek, making the water unfit for drinking, and the national spread of diseases like typhoid fever demanded a safer supply.
8.  **Innovative Solution: Modern Treatment (1899):** YORW moved its water intake upstream and built a new filtration plant, which was the first successfully operated water treatment plant in Pennsylvania; they also began adding chlorine to the purified water to kill bacteria and prevent the spread of disease.

#### **Part 3: Securing the Future (20th and 21st Centuries)**

9.  **Headwind: Drought Risk and Water Security:** The company recognized that relying solely on the natural flow of the creek was risky and that a growing community needed a secure water source for times of drought.
10. **Innovative Solution: Reservoirs and Watershed Protection:** YORW constructed two major dams, creating Lake Williams and Lake Redman, which act as large water preserves and recreational spots for the community.
11. **Tailwind: Environmental Stewardship:** The company was a conservation leader, earning praise from President Coolidge for its extensive reforestation efforts in the watershed—planting over a million evergreen trees to prevent soil erosion and protect the water quality.
12. **Headwind: Protecting Against Aging Infrastructure & Lead:** More recently, the company faced the modern challenge of aging pipes, including the potential for lead leaching into the drinking water.
13. **Innovative Solution: Corrosion Control:** After measuring elevated lead levels in 1992, YORW successfully adjusted the water's natural chemistry (increasing its pH) to reduce pipe corrosion, a solution that has consistently kept lead levels below regulatory safety limits.

#### **Part 4: The Company Today and Its Core Goal**

14. **The Core Business:** Today, YORW's main activity is still to capture, purify, and distribute high-quality drinking water, but it has also grown to include operating wastewater collection and treatment systems.
15. **Tailwind: Consistent Returns:** The company holds the unparalleled record of paying consecutive dividends to its shareholders every year since its founding in 1816.
16. **Tailwind: Modernizing Infrastructure:** To manage the cost of updating its aging pipes and facilities, the company benefits from a regulatory tool called the Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC), which allows it to recover specific replacement costs more quickly without a full rate increase filing.
17. **Headwind: Economic and Weather Vulnerability:** Because YORW's operations are mostly limited to a specific region of Pennsylvania, its revenue can be negatively affected by regional economic slowdowns and weather conditions, such as drought restrictions that limit water usage.
18. **Goal for the Future:** The company continues to invest in infrastructure, looks for growth by acquiring smaller water and wastewater systems in nearby areas, and aims to be a dependable provider of essential services while earning a fair return for its shareholders.

## Moat Analysis

The York Water Company (YORW) has a solid, classic "economic moat" typical of utilities, but with a few distinguishing factors. Its defensibility comes from the high cost and difficulty of building a rival system in an established service area.

Here is an analysis of The York Water Company's moat:

### 1. The Core Moat: Regulated Monopoly and Essential Service

*   **Exclusive Franchise:** The company operates as a regulated monopoly within its franchised territory in south-central Pennsylvania. This exclusive right, granted and overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), legally bars direct competition from new companies in its service area.
*   **Massive Upfront Cost:** The primary defense against new competitors is the enormous and nearly impossible-to-replicate cost of the physical infrastructure—the extensive network of dams, reservoirs, treatment plants, and over a thousand miles of water and wastewater mains.
*   **Extremely High Barriers to Entry:** This capital-intensive network, once built, makes it financially impractical for a new entity, even one with significant capital, to enter the market and displace YORW.

### 2. Market Position and Pricing Power

*   **Regulated Pricing Power:** YORW does not have market-driven pricing power like an unregulated company, but it has **regulated pricing power**. The PUC sets rates based on a "cost-plus" model, allowing the company to recover its operating expenses and earn a fair, authorized return on its significant infrastructure investments (utility plant and equipment).
*   **Investment Recovery:** The company can file for general rate increases (which it does periodically, like the one filed in 2025) and utilizes a Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) to recover costs from ongoing capital projects. This ensures investments like water main replacements and treatment plant upgrades contribute to future revenue.
*   **The Difference from Competitors: Low-Cost Provider:** A key differentiator for YORW is its ability to offer its essential services at a lower cost than many competing water companies in the region. This affordability and a generally high level of customer satisfaction serve as a competitive advantage, especially when acquiring smaller municipal or private water systems.

### 3. Customer Stickiness and Contracts

*   **Sticky and Recurring Customers:** The customer relationship is the definition of "sticky and recurring." The service is a non-discretionary necessity for residential, commercial, and industrial customers, and since YORW is the sole provider, customers cannot switch to a competitor.
*   **Contracts/Service:** The relationship is not based on a one-time contract but on continuous utility service, which translates into highly predictable and resilient cash flow, regardless of economic conditions.

### 4. Reason for Longevity and Moat Strengthening

*   **Historical Foundation:** The company’s long history, established in 1816, makes it the oldest investor-owned water utility in the United States, giving it an unparalleled institutional track record.
*   **Dividend Track Record:** A special differentiator is its record of having the longest streak of uninterrupted dividend payments in American history, dating back to its founding. This speaks to the incredible stability and resilience of its regulated monopoly business model over two centuries.
*   **Moat Strategy: Acquisition and Investment:** YORW actively strengthens and expands its moat by continuously making substantial capital investments in its infrastructure (e.g., the Lake Williams Dam rehabilitation) and by strategically acquiring smaller, struggling water and wastewater systems in neighboring counties, effectively expanding its exclusive franchise territory.

### 5. Innovation and R&D

*   **Focus on Infrastructure and Compliance, Not R&D:** The business model does not rely on cutting-edge technological R&D or constant product innovation.
*   **Operational Excellence:** The company’s edge comes from operational excellence: efficiently managing its water resources, maintaining aging infrastructure, and ensuring compliance with stringent government water quality and environmental standards. The significant capital spending is on modernization and compliance, not traditional "R&D."

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that might increase The York Water Company (YORW) stock price are rooted in its regulated utility model, significant infrastructure investment plans, and growth strategy.

### Near-Term Catalysts (6–18 Months)

1.  **Rate Case Approval:** The most significant near-term catalyst is the decision on the rate request filed in May 2025, which seeks a $\$24.2$ million increase in annual revenue to compensate for a $\$145$ million investment in infrastructure. Approval of this request by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) would immediately increase cash flow and earnings.
2.  **Customer Base Growth:** Recent small acquisitions, such as the wastewater system in the Pine Run Retirement Community, and organic customer base expansion in Adams County contribute to immediate revenue growth. This growth, along with revenues from the Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC), is helping to increase operating revenues.
3.  **Positive Earnings Momentum:** The company recently beat analyst expectations for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue in its second quarter of 2025, which can lead to positive investor sentiment and short-term price movement.

### Long-Term Catalysts (1–5+ Years)

1.  **Sustained Capital Investment:** The company plans to invest approximately $\$46.0$ million in 2025 and $\$48.5$ million in 2026 on crucial infrastructure projects, excluding future acquisitions. These substantial investments enhance service reliability and form the basis for future rate increase filings, which support long-term revenue growth.
2.  **Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy:** The company continues to acquire water and wastewater systems, a core strategy for expanding its service territory and customer count beyond its existing footprint in South-central Pennsylvania. Each successful acquisition adds regulated assets and future earnings potential.
3.  **Dividend History and Reliability:** As a conservative, high-quality utility with an unmatched 200+ year history of paying consecutive dividends, YORW attracts and retains long-term, stability-focused investors. Consistent dividend declarations support the stock's floor price and total return profile.

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Commentary

President and CEO JT Hand has consistently pointed to the key drivers for revenue growth and the future strategy:

*   **Capital Investment as a Core Strategy:** Management's reported strategy is centered on significant capital expenditures—like the Lake Williams dam renovation—to replace aging infrastructure and comply with regulations, which then supports the need for rate increases and long-term financial health.
*   **Revenue Drivers:** Management specifically reports that the primary drivers for increased revenue are growth in the customer base and the revenues collected through the Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC).
*   **Future Capital Plan:** The company has laid out a clear investment plan for 2025 and 2026 for system upgrades, main extensions, and wastewater treatment plant construction to ensure a safe and reliable supply for their growing customer base.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of The York Water Company's (YORW) management incentives and compensation, primarily based on its recent proxy statements, suggests a balanced structure, with key indicators pointing toward alignment with long-term shareholder interests.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Aggregate Insider Ownership, but Individual Commitment:** Total insider ownership (managers and directors as a group) is reported as low at approximately 1.13% of the float. However, the CEO, JT Hand, holds a personally significant stake of approximately $1.2 million, or 0.27% of the company's shares, indicating he has "skin in the game."
2.  **Director Stock Ownership Requirement:** The company enforces a clear policy requiring non-employee directors to own shares valued at three times their annual cash retainer within five years of appointment, which formally aligns their financial interests with shareholders.

### **Compensation Structure**

3.  **Below-Industry Compensation:** The CEO's total annual compensation is reported to be below the median for comparable companies in the American Water Utilities industry, which is generally viewed positively by shareholders concerned about excessive pay.
4.  **Heavy Weighting Towards Fixed Pay:** A significant portion of the CEO's compensation is structured as a fixed salary, resulting in a lower variable/performance-based component compared to the industry average. This focus on fixed pay may suggest a lower reliance on aggressive short-term performance targets, which is often typical for a stable, regulated utility business.
5.  **Multi-Component Long-Term Incentive (LTI):** The Long-Term Incentive (LTI) portion is divided into three types of equity awards: Stock Options (1/3), Restricted Stock (1/3), and Performance-Based Units (1/3), balancing retention (through time-vested Restricted Stock) with performance-based rewards.

### **Performance Metrics and Shareholder Alignment**

6.  **Direct Shareholder Return Metric:** The most direct link to shareholder interest is the Performance-Based Units (PUPs) within the LTI, which are tied to the company's three-year **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** relative to the S&P MidCap 400 index. This metric directly incentivizes management to outperform the broader market.
7.  **Key Financial Metrics:** The Annual Performance-Based Incentive (cash bonus) is tied to critical financial measures: **Normalized Earnings Per Share (EPS)** and **Normalized Free Cash Flow per Share (FCF)**, which incentivize efficient operations and capital management.
8.  **Inclusion of Operational/Service Metric:** The annual incentive plan also includes a **customer-centric metric** (Google star/customer satisfaction ratings), ensuring management balances financial performance with the core utility service responsibilities and regulatory environment.

### **Conclusion**

*   **Incentive to Act in the Interest of Shareholders:** **Yes**, the management has a strong, formal incentive to act in the interest of shareholders. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is well-structured, directly linking a significant portion of potential wealth creation to **Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a market index**. The inclusion of FCF and EPS in the annual bonus further aligns pay with fundamental value drivers.
*   **Incentivized to Line Their Own Pockets:** **No**, the compensation structure does not appear primarily designed to line their own pockets. The CEO's total pay is below the industry median, and a large component is based on objective, externally verified performance measures (TSR, EPS, FCF). The existing personal stock ownership by the CEO also ensures his financial well-being is tied to the stock price.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of The York Water Company (YORW) price history and technical indicators as of October 10, 2025:

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** The stock is trading at $31.02, which is **4.51%** above its 52-week low of $29.68.
2.  **Trading Near Lows:** Given the 52-week high is $38.50 and the current price is close to the 52-week low, the stock is considered to be trading near its multi-year lows, making its valuation look attractive to some investors.
3.  **Technical Analysis Signals (Mixed):** Technical analysis shows mixed signals, with "buy signals" from both short and long-term Moving Averages, yet a "general sell signal" exists because the long-term average is above the short-term average.
4.  **Overall Technical Evaluation:** The stock has experienced five consecutive days of gains and is characterized by generally controlled movements and low risk volatility. However, some technical evaluations still hold a negative or "Sell" evaluation, advising against buying the stock in the short term.
5.  **Recent Price Drop Explanation:** The stock price has fallen by approximately 18% over the last 12 months and nearly 9% over the last six months. This significant drop is largely attributed to general weakness and "recent earnings declines," which is creating a more favorable valuation for a stable water utility company.
6.  **Historical Stability:** Despite the recent downturn, The York Water Company is renowned for its stability as the oldest investor-owned water utility in the U.S. and for being a "Dividend Aristocrat" that has paid uninterrupted dividends for over 200 years.
7.  **Recent Growth Event:** A notable event in May 2025 was the filing of a rate request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, which is based on $145 million in investment and is a potential source for future revenue and earnings growth.

## Long Thesis

The York Water Company is a low-risk, high-quality investment because it operates as an exclusive, government-regulated monopoly providing essential water and sewer services—customers cannot switch providers. The company’s long-term earnings growth is practically guaranteed by its business model. Management is executing a strategy of investing large sums of money into replacing and upgrading its aging dams, pipes, and treatment plants (such as the current plan of over $45 million annually). The government guarantees YORW can raise customer rates (through mechanisms like the major rate case filed in 2025) to recover these costs and earn a government-approved profit on those assets. Additionally, YORW actively boosts its customer base by buying smaller, struggling municipal water systems, expanding its exclusive territory. This predictable model, supported by mandated investments and growth through acquisition, ensures stable cash flow and will allow YORW to continue its unmatched 200-year history of paying dividends.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) continues to approve rate increases (like the pending 2025 filing) that allow the company to recover its costs and earn a fair profit on its capital investments. We also assume YORW can successfully and efficiently execute its multi-year, multi-million dollar infrastructure upgrade plan without major cost overruns. Finally, the local population and economy in its service territory must remain stable or continue to grow, maintaining steady demand for its essential services.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for The York Water Company overlooks several critical risks and operates under assumptions that are directly challenged by the current regulatory environment and financial reality.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **Regulatory Risk (The "Guaranteed Profit" Flaw):**
    The core assumption that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) will "guarantee" a fair profit and approve the full cost recovery is flawed. The PUC has a precedent of significantly reducing rate requests from major water utilities, with some peers seeing requests cut by over 40-50%, introducing a significant risk of under-recovery on YORW's capital investments.

2.  **Regulatory Lag and Uncertainty:**
    The filing of a major rate case in May 2025 introduces a regulatory lag, as the PUC has the power to delay the effective date of the new rates until March 2026. This delay means the company must absorb the debt financing costs of its multi-million dollar infrastructure projects for a prolonged period before revenue recovery begins.

3.  **Profitability of Acquisitions is Under Threat:**
    The strategy of "boosting its customer base by buying smaller, struggling municipal water systems" may become less profitable due to increased regulatory scrutiny. The PUC is implementing stricter oversight on privatization deals to curb the steep rate hikes that critics say were previously incentivized, which may limit YORW's ability to maximize returns on acquired assets.

4.  **High Valuation and Slow Dividend Growth:**
    The stock trades at a premium valuation compared to some of its water utility peers, especially considering its smaller size and regional focus. The company's historic 200-year dividend streak is a legacy point, but recent dividend growth (3.46% CAGR 2007-2023) has been significantly slower than its profit growth, suggesting management is prioritizing CapEx/acquisitions over meaningful returns to income investors.

5.  **Capital Intensity and Debt Risk:**
    The reliance on consistently investing large sums (\$45+ million annually, with \$145 million planned through early 2027) necessitates frequent rate case filings and the issuance of new debt or equity. Failure to secure the full requested rate increase places the burden of debt service and capital expenditure squarely on current customers and potentially weakens the balance sheet, increasing financial risk.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for The York Water Company (YORW)**

**YORW is an overvalued, slow-growth utility whose regulated, long-term returns are under increasing pressure from a restrictive state commission, creating a mismatch between its premium stock price and its real earning power.**

1.  **Uncertain Regulatory Headwinds:** The "guaranteed profit" model is fundamentally challenged by the Pennsylvania PUC, which has a clear mandate and history of significantly cutting rate increase requests from large water utilities. The outcome of YORW's major 2025 rate case will be highly contentious and likely reduced, delaying and lowering the expected return on the mandated $145 million in new capital investments.

2.  **Diminishing Returns on Acquisition Strategy:** State regulators are cracking down on municipal water system acquisitions to prevent steep rate hikes for new customers, which will cap the profitability of future "bolt-on" growth. This limits YORW’s most reliable avenue for expanding its rate base and generating the required return on equity.

3.  **Premium Valuation for Sub-Par Dividend Growth:** The stock trades at a premium Price-to-Earnings ratio compared to some larger, more diversified water utility peers, yet its slow dividend growth rate does not support a high valuation for a typical income-focused utility investor. Investors are paying a high price multiple for a historical dividend streak and CapEx-driven growth that is not translating into commensurate dividend increases.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the analysis provided and the information gathered from the initial search, the most critical next steps should focus on quantifying the regulatory risk and validating the stock's valuation.

### **Next Steps and Unanswered Questions for Investigation**

#### **1. Quantify the Regulatory Risk (Test the Bear Case)**

*   **Determine the historical rate case outcome for YORW.** The bear case claims the PUC cuts requests by 40-50%. Search for the actual requested amount versus the approved amount for The York Water Company's *last* general rate case (filed in 2022) to see if this reduction rate is consistent for YORW.
*   **Finalize the current rate case status.** While the May 2025 filing requested a $\$24.2$ million increase based on $\$145$ million in investments and hearings were scheduled for August 2025, the final verdict or a settlement agreement is the most important near-term catalyst. Search for the actual decision or current status to eliminate the uncertainty of the regulatory lag (which could push new rates to March 2026).
*   **Investigate the approved Return on Equity (ROE).** Find the specific ROE the Pennsylvania PUC last approved for YORW. This number is the core regulated profit YORW can earn on its investments, and changes to it are critical for the long-term thesis (For context, a large PA peer recently had a 9.45% ROE approved).

#### **2. Validate the Valuation Disconnect (Test the Overvalued/Undervalued Debate)**

*   **Determine a clear, current peer comparison.** The analysis currently shows mixed valuation signals: YORW's P/E is expensive compared to the industry average (22.5x vs 16.7x), but good value compared to a peer group average (22.5x vs 29.4x). Create a direct table of current P/E, Price-to-Book (P/B), and Dividend Yield for YORW versus its most comparable regulated PA-focused peers (e.g., Essential Utilities (WTRG) and American Water Works (AWK), which operates Pennsylvania American Water) to get a clear picture.
*   **Analyze the Dividend Payout Ratio.** The Bear Case notes slow dividend growth. Calculate YORW's current dividend payout ratio to determine how much free cash flow (or EPS) management is truly retaining for capital expenditures and acquisitions versus returning to shareholders.

#### **3. Investigate Acquisition and Long-Term Growth Assumptions**

*   **Examine the impact of new privatization rules.** The Bear Case mentions increased regulatory scrutiny on acquisitions to "curb the steep rate hikes" for new customers. Search for the specific regulation or PUC order that implemented this change and how it might impact YORW's ability to maximize returns on newly acquired assets.
*   **Research the new Lancaster County service area.** The 2023 expansion into Lancaster County was a major milestone. Investigate the current status and profitability of that acquisition (Conewago Industrial Park) to validate management's growth-by-acquisition strategy.
