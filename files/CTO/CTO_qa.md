## Business Summary

CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on acquiring and managing single-tenant net-lease properties. These properties are primarily commercial spaces leased to large corporations and established businesses across the United States. The company's revenue is mainly generated from rental income collected from these long-term leases. Essentially, CTO buys buildings, signs long leases with stable companies to rent them, and collects rent, providing a steady income stream from its real estate investments. Its customers are typically well-established businesses that need reliable, long-term locations for their operations.

---

## Business Model Risk

A primary near-term risk for CTO is the rising interest rate environment, which can increase the cost of borrowing money to acquire new properties and may decrease the value of existing properties. Long-term risks include the potential for tenants to terminate their leases early or not renew them, especially if their business operations change or if they face financial difficulties. The company could also face challenges from economic downturns that impact the tenants' ability to pay rent or from shifts in consumer behavior that make certain types of commercial real estate less desirable. For example, the rise of e-commerce has put pressure on retail real estate, and if CTO's tenants are in struggling retail sectors, it could lead to vacancies and reduced income.

## Company History

Here's a history of CTO Realty Growth, Inc., from its inception to the present day, explaining its founding, challenges, and growth strategies:

### Inception and Founding Purpose

1.  **Early Origins (1910):** CTO Realty Growth, Inc. has a long history, tracing its roots back to 1910 when it was incorporated as the Consolidated Naval Stores Company. This early iteration of the company was formed through the consolidation of several naval stores operators.
2.  **Shift to Land Management:** By 1968, the company changed its name to Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co., reflecting a strategic shift away from naval stores towards managing vast timberland resources, primarily in Florida.
3.  **Transition to Income Properties:** Over the years, Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. began to divest significant portions of its legacy land holdings. This strategic move allowed the company to acquire income-producing commercial properties, diversifying its revenue streams.
4.  **Conversion to REIT and Rebranding:** A pivotal moment occurred in 2020 when the company converted to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and rebranded as CTO Realty Growth, Inc. This conversion aligned its structure and strategy with income-focused real estate investment, enabling it to access REIT capital markets and attract income-oriented investors. The company's core purpose became acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of primarily retail-based properties in high-growth markets, especially in the Sun Belt region of the United States.

### Challenges Faced and Innovative Solutions

1.  **Legacy Land Holdings:** A significant challenge was managing and eventually divesting its extensive legacy land holdings. The company innovatively began to sell off these land assets to fund the acquisition of income-producing properties.
2.  **Market Volatility and Interest Rate Hikes:** Like many real estate companies, CTO has faced challenges from rising interest rates, which can impact investment returns and borrowing costs. Additionally, market fluctuations and potential economic downturns can affect tenant performance and property valuations. The company is addressing this by focusing on necessity-based retail properties and maintaining a disciplined approach to acquisitions and active asset management.
3.  **Scaling and Integration Risks:** As CTO grows through acquisitions, integrating these new properties and ensuring they generate expected returns can be challenging. The company aims to mitigate this through rigorous evaluation of market conditions, tenant metrics, and by focusing on accretive acquisitions and active portfolio enhancement.
4.  **Recent Allegations and Scrutiny:** In mid-2025, CTO faced allegations of securities fraud, including concerns about dividend sustainability and the manipulation of financial metrics like Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO). These issues have led to increased scrutiny from investors and regulatory bodies, posing a significant risk to investor trust and potentially leading to legal action. The company is working to address these concerns, including strengthening its balance sheet through new financing.

### Tailwinds and Headwinds

1.  **Tailwinds - Sun Belt Growth:** CTO has benefited significantly from focusing on high-growth markets in the Sun Belt region of the United States. These areas often experience strong demographic trends and economic activity, providing a favorable environment for retail property performance.
2.  **Tailwinds - Low Retail Supply:** A growing tailwind for retail REITs like CTO is the low supply of quality retail space. With minimal new construction in recent years, vacancies have decreased, leading to increased demand and rental rates for well-located properties.
3.  **Tailwinds - Strong Dividend History:** The company has a consistent track record of paying stable dividends, which is attractive to income-oriented investors.
4.  **Headwinds - Rising Interest Rates:** As mentioned, rising interest rates increase borrowing costs and can compress property valuations, posing a headwind for real estate investments.
5.  **Headwinds - Economic Downturns:** Potential recessions can impact consumer spending and tenant performance, creating risks for retail properties.
6.  **Headwinds - Capital Market Constraints:** At times, capital markets can be constrained, making it more challenging to secure financing or execute large-scale transactions. CTO addresses this by focusing on internal growth through leasing and active asset management, alongside opportunistic dispositions.

### Current Goal and Strategy

CTO Realty Growth, Inc.'s primary goal is to own and operate a portfolio of high-quality, retail-based properties in high-growth markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Their strategy involves:

*   **Active Portfolio Management:** Continuously refining and enhancing the portfolio by acquiring well-located assets, improving existing properties, and divesting non-core assets.
*   **Strategic Acquisitions:** Targeting properties in high-growth areas where they can add value through leasing and management expertise. They aim for larger-format retail properties with good synergies.
*   **Capital Recycling:** Selling smaller assets to reinvest in larger, more strategic centers.
*   **Dividend Focus:** Maintaining a consistent and attractive dividend for shareholders, supported by income-generating properties.
*   **Growth through Leasing:** Focusing on strong leasing activity, securing positive rental rate spreads, and filling vacant anchor spaces to drive future earnings.

The company aims to be a leading retail-focused REIT by strategically investing in resilient markets and actively managing its properties to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value.

## Moat Analysis

Here's an analysis of CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) and its competitive moat:

**1. Differentiated Market Position and Strategy:**

*   CTO Realty Growth focuses on multi-tenant retail properties, particularly in high-growth Sun Belt markets across the United States. This geographic concentration allows them to capitalize on favorable demographic and economic trends, aiming for faster growth in rental income and property values.
*   Unlike larger competitors, CTO's smaller size can enable more agile acquisition strategies, allowing them to target properties where they can add value.
*   The company also has a unique historical element of owning subsurface oil, gas, and mineral interests, which it leases for exploration.

**2. Pricing Power and Product Differentiation:**

*   CTO's primary revenue source is rental income from its properties. While specific pricing power details aren't extensively detailed, their strategy of acquiring properties in high-growth areas and focusing on necessity-based and service-oriented tenants suggests a degree of resilience in their rental pricing.
*   The company emphasizes acquiring assets where they can add value through leasing and management expertise. This hands-on approach to property management and tenant relations could contribute to stronger lease terms and renewals.
*   The recent leasing activity shows strong comparable growth in average cash base rent, indicating an ability to increase rents on renewed or new leases.

**3. Reasons for Growth and Displaceability:**

*   **Growth Drivers:** CTO's growth has been fueled by a strategic focus on high-growth Sun Belt markets, active capital recycling (selling lower-yielding properties to reinvest in higher-yielding acquisitions), and a disciplined acquisition strategy. Their transformation into a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in 2020 also allowed for better access to capital markets and alignment with income-focused investors.
*   **Displaceability:** As a real estate investment trust, CTO operates in a competitive market. Larger REITs with more capital could potentially acquire properties or entire portfolios. However, CTO's niche focus and agility in identifying value-add opportunities may provide some defense. Their strategy of acquiring properties below replacement cost also makes them less susceptible to new development competition.

**4. Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:**

*   The nature of retail property leases is generally recurring, providing a consistent revenue stream for CTO.
*   The focus on necessity-based and service-oriented tenants could lead to greater tenant retention, as these businesses are often more resilient to economic downturns.
*   A strategy of replacing bankrupt tenants with new ones at significantly higher rents indicates a dynamic approach to maintaining and improving lease revenue.

**5. Moat Creation and Competitive Advantages:**

*   **Active Portfolio Management:** CTO actively recycles capital by selling underperforming or non-core assets and reinvesting the proceeds into properties with higher growth potential. This strategy optimizes their portfolio and can generate gains on sale.
*   **Geographic Focus:** Concentration in high-growth Sun Belt markets positions them well for demographic and economic tailwinds.
*   **Experienced Management:** The company highlights an experienced management team with extensive commercial real estate background.
*   **Dividend Policy:** A consistent dividend payment history is attractive to income-focused investors.
*   **Valuation:** At times, CTO has been noted as trading at a discount to its peers or fair value, suggesting potential upside for investors.

**6. R&D and Innovation:**

*   As a real estate investment trust, CTO's "R&D" is more focused on market analysis, property acquisition strategies, and asset management rather than traditional product development. They invest in understanding market trends, demographics, and identifying properties with value-add potential.
*   Constant innovation in this sector involves adapting to market shifts, tenant needs, and economic conditions through strategic leasing, property upgrades, and portfolio adjustments.

In summary, CTO Realty Growth's moat is built on a focused strategy of acquiring and managing retail properties in high-growth Sun Belt markets, coupled with active portfolio management and a nimble approach that differentiates it from larger competitors. Its recurring revenue model through leases and strategic value-add initiatives contribute to its stability and growth potential.

## Catalyst Analysis

## Catalysts for CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO)

CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) has several potential catalysts that could drive its stock price higher in both the near and long term. These catalysts are largely centered around strategic property management, financial flexibility, and shareholder returns.

### Near-Term Catalysts

1.  **Strengthening Balance Sheet and Enhanced Liquidity:**
    CTO recently closed a $150 million term loan financing, which includes a new $125 million loan due in 2030 and a $25 million expansion of an existing loan due in 2029. This move allows the company to retire a $65 million loan due in 2026, significantly reducing near-term debt maturities. The financing also enhances CTO's liquidity to approximately $165 million. Management, through CEO John P. Albright, stated this transaction "enhances our liquidity... extends our debt maturity profile, and provides flexibility to pursue investments in high-quality shopping center assets". This financial strengthening provides a more stable foundation for operations and future growth.

2.  **Share Buyback Program:**
    The company's Board of Directors has approved a new $10 million common stock repurchase program, following the completion of a previous $5 million program. This demonstrates management's commitment to returning value to shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares, which can boost earnings per share. The program allows for flexibility in repurchasing shares through various market transactions.

3.  **Property Sales and Portfolio Optimization:**
    CTO has been actively managing its property portfolio, including the recent sale of its Main Street properties in Daytona Beach, Florida, for $7.1 million. This divestiture of non-core assets, as highlighted in their news releases, is part of a strategy to focus on higher-quality retail properties in growth markets, which can lead to improved overall portfolio performance and asset value.

### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Strategic Acquisitions and Development:**
    The company's strategy is focused on acquiring high-quality shopping center assets in growth markets. Recent acquisitions, such as Ashley Park, a lifestyle center in the Atlanta, Georgia submarket, demonstrate this focus. Management, as noted in the Q1 2025 earnings call, highlighted Ashley Park's attributes as aligning with their acquisition criteria. Investments in properties with strong demographics, like Ashford Lane in Atlanta with high household incomes and significant population within a five-mile radius, signal a long-term growth strategy.

2.  **Leasing Momentum and Occupancy Improvements:**
    CTO is experiencing positive leasing momentum. In Q2 2025, they reported strong leasing activity with 227,000 sq ft of new leases signed. Their portfolio was 93.8% leased at the end of Q1 2025, with a signed but not yet occupied pipeline representing 4% of cash rents. Management indicated that the rent commencement from this pipeline, weighted towards the second half of 2025, along with anchor space re-leasing, will provide a strong tailwind going into 2026. The recent opening of Boot Barn and Barnes & Noble at Plaza at Rockwall, boosting occupancy to 99%, is another example of successful leasing efforts.

3.  **Synergies with Alpine Income Property Trust (PINE):**
    CTO Realty Growth externally manages and owns a significant interest in Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (PINE). While PINE's recent performance has shown mixed results, the strategic relationship allows CTO to leverage its expertise and potentially benefit from any future growth or operational improvements within PINE's portfolio, creating a diversified revenue stream and broader market reach.

Management's consistent communication in earnings calls emphasizes a strategic approach to asset acquisition, portfolio enhancement, and financial management, aiming to deliver sustained shareholder value through these catalysts.

**2. Compensation Structure:**
*   A significant portion of executive compensation is performance-based, with around 79% of the CEO's 2024 pay being variable. This includes annual incentive plans tied to metrics like Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per Diluted Share and long-term incentives based on relative Total Stockholder Return.

## Long Thesis

CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) presents a compelling long-term growth opportunity driven by its strategic focus on acquiring and managing high-quality, retail-focused properties in high-growth Sun Belt markets. The company's strategy of active portfolio management, including the sale of non-core assets and reinvestment in properties with strong leasing potential and value-add opportunities, is expected to enhance overall portfolio performance and drive rental income growth. CTO's ability to execute strategic acquisitions, coupled with strong leasing momentum and rising rental rates on renewed leases, positions it to benefit from favorable market conditions such as low retail supply and strong demographic trends in its target regions. Furthermore, the company's ongoing share buyback programs and consistent dividend payments offer attractive returns to shareholders. The recent strengthening of its balance sheet through debt financing provides financial flexibility for future growth initiatives and debt maturity management. The company's disciplined approach to capital allocation, including the potential synergies with its managed entity, Alpine Income Property Trust, further supports a positive outlook for sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case for CTO Realty Growth, Inc. assumes several key factors will materialize: continued strong economic and demographic growth in the Sun Belt regions where the company invests; an ongoing low supply of quality retail real estate, leading to sustained rental rate increases; the company's continued success in identifying and acquiring attractive properties at favorable valuations; effective execution of value-add strategies, such as improving existing properties and securing new tenants at higher rental rates; sustained low interest rates or an ability to manage debt effectively despite rising rates; no significant unforeseen economic downturns that materially impact tenant financial health or consumer spending; the successful integration of acquired properties and management of their operations; continued confidence from the market in management's strategy and execution, despite past legal challenges; and the maintenance of a strong dividend payout supported by growing cash flows.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

Here's a critique of the long thesis for CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO) and a potential bear case:

## Critique of the Long Thesis for CTO Realty Growth, Inc.

The long thesis for CTO presents a positive outlook based on several key assumptions. However, a closer examination reveals potential vulnerabilities and risks that could challenge this optimistic view.

1.  **Over-reliance on Sun Belt Growth:** While Sun Belt markets offer demographic advantages, the thesis assumes this growth will be sustained and uniformly beneficial. Economic downturns, increased competition, or shifts in migration patterns could negatively impact these markets, affecting CTO's property values and rental income.
2.  **Assumptions on Retail Real Estate Supply and Demand:** The thesis relies heavily on a continued low supply of quality retail real estate leading to sustained rental rate increases. However, changes in consumer behavior (e.g., e-commerce growth), overbuilding in certain submarkets, or a general economic slowdown could weaken demand and pressure rental rates.
3.  **Execution Risk in Value-Add Strategies:** The thesis presumes CTO's ability to effectively execute value-add strategies and secure tenants at higher rates. This involves significant execution risk, as re-tenanting and redevelopment can be costly and time-consuming, with no guarantee of success or desired rental increases.
4.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity and Debt Management:** The thesis suggests CTO can manage debt effectively, even with rising interest rates. However, increased borrowing costs could significantly impact profitability, cash flow available for dividends, and the ability to fund future acquisitions, especially if property values don't keep pace.
5.  **Management's Track Record and Shareholder Confidence:** The thesis acknowledges "past legal challenges" but assumes continued market confidence. Significant legal issues or governance concerns can erode investor trust and impact the stock's valuation, regardless of operational performance.
6.  **Synergies with Alpine Income Property Trust:** While potential synergies are mentioned, the actual realization of these benefits is not guaranteed. Integrating and managing two separate entities effectively can be complex and may not yield the expected cost savings or revenue enhancements.

## Bear Case Thesis for CTO Realty Growth, Inc.

CTO Realty Growth, Inc. faces significant headwinds that could hinder its growth prospects and negatively impact shareholder returns.

1.  **Interest Rate Hikes and Refinancing Risk:** Rising interest rates will increase CTO's borrowing costs, putting pressure on its net operating income (NOI) and free cash flow. This could make refinancing maturing debt more expensive and challenging, potentially impacting the company's financial flexibility.
2.  **Deteriorating Retail Landscape and Tenant Defaults:** The secular shift towards e-commerce and changing consumer habits continue to challenge traditional brick-and-mortar retail. This increases the risk of tenant defaults and lease expirations without renewal at comparable rates, negatively impacting occupancy and rental income.
3.  **Economic Slowdown and Reduced Consumer Spending:** A potential economic recession or significant slowdown in the Sun Belt regions could lead to reduced consumer spending, impacting tenants' ability to pay rent and driving down property values.
4.  **Increased Competition and Valuation Challenges:** As Sun Belt markets grow, they are likely to attract more real estate investment, increasing competition for high-quality assets. This could drive up acquisition costs, making it harder for CTO to find attractive properties at favorable valuations, thus undermining its acquisition strategy.
5.  **Dividend Sustainability Concerns:** If NOI growth falters due to rising interest rates, tenant issues, or economic slowdown, the sustainability of CTO's dividend could come under pressure. A dividend cut or suspension would likely lead to a significant sell-off in the stock.
6.  **Execution Risks and Past Governance Issues:** The company's history of legal challenges raises concerns about management's execution and governance. Any recurrence of such issues could severely damage investor confidence and the stock's valuation, even if underlying operations appear sound.

---

## Next Steps

Here are some next steps and important questions to investigate further regarding CTO Realty Growth, Inc. (CTO):

1.  **Analyze the Impact of the Securities Fraud Allegations:** Given the allegations of securities fraud surfaced in mid-2025, it is crucial to investigate the ongoing legal proceedings, potential outcomes, and any fines or settlements that may arise. Understanding the severity and implications of these allegations is paramount for assessing management integrity and future financial stability.
2.  **Scrutinize Dividend Sustainability:** While CTO has a history of paying dividends, the negative payout ratio noted in the price history warrants further investigation. It's essential to understand the drivers behind this negative ratio and assess the long-term sustainability of the dividend, especially in light of rising interest rates and potential economic headwinds.
3.  **Evaluate Tenant Concentration and Lease Expirations:** A deeper dive into CTO's tenant roster is needed. Understanding the concentration of revenue among key tenants and the upcoming lease expiration schedule can reveal potential risks related to tenant default or non-renewal, particularly in light of shifts in the retail landscape.
4.  **Assess the Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Debt and Valuations:** While the company has recently secured new financing, it's important to continually monitor the impact of rising interest rates on CTO's overall debt obligations, borrowing costs, and the valuation of its real estate portfolio. Understanding the company's strategy for managing floating-rate debt and future refinancing needs is critical.
5.  **Investigate Synergies and Performance of Alpine Income Property Trust (PINE):** The relationship with PINE is mentioned as a potential catalyst, but its recent performance has been mixed. A thorough analysis of the actual synergies realized, the operational performance of PINE, and any associated costs or benefits for CTO is necessary to validate this aspect of the long-term thesis.
6.  **Examine Management's Response to Recent Scrutiny and Legal Issues:** Understanding how the management team has responded to the allegations of securities fraud and investor scrutiny is vital. Evaluating their transparency, communication strategies, and any corrective actions taken will provide insight into their commitment to good governance and investor trust.
7.  **Analyze Geographic and Property Type Diversification within the Sun Belt:** While the focus on the Sun Belt is a positive, it's important to understand the level of diversification within this strategy. Assessing the specific markets and property types (e.g., necessity retail vs. lifestyle centers) within their Sun Belt portfolio can reveal unique risks and opportunities.
