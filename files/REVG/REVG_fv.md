## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for REV Group is focused on two segments: **Specialty Vehicles** (Fire & Emergency, Commercial) and **Recreational Vehicles (RV)**. The valuation is primarily driven by the high backlog and operational efficiencies in the Specialty Vehicles segment, while the RV segment is managed for disciplined profitability amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.

**Key Business Driver Assumptions (Based on Management Commentary):**

1.  **Specialty Vehicles:** The segment is the primary growth engine, driven by production ramp-ups, throughput increases (especially in the Fire Group, e.g., Spartan Emergency Response), and price realization. The backlog provides 1 to 2.5 years of demand visibility. Management's long-term expectation is for **GDP+ growth** with **30-50 basis point annual margin expansion** starting from a FY2024 pro-forma base of approximately $1.56 billion.
2.  **Recreational Vehicles (RV):** This segment is expected to be more volatile, transitioning to "more normalized demand levels." Its revenue guidance for FY2025 is flat year-over-year ($625M - $650M).

| Year | Specialty Vehicles Growth | RV Growth | Consolidated Revenue (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025 (Guidance)** | Mid-Teens (used 15.0%) | Flat (used 0.0%) | **$2,425.0** (Management Midpoint) |
| **FY 2026** | **9.0%** | **1.0%** | **$2,618.3** |
| **FY 2027** | **7.0%** | **2.0%** | **$2,788.7** |
| **FY 2028** | **5.0%** | **2.0%** | **$2,919.1** |
| **FY 2029** | **4.0%** | **1.5%** | **$3,030.7** |
| **FY 2030** | **4.0%** | **1.5%** | **$3,145.4** |

**Justification for Revenue Estimates:**
*   **2025:** Uses the midpoint of management's guidance.
*   **2026-2027 (Backlog Conversion):** The strong mid-teens growth for Specialty Vehicles in 2025 is assumed to moderate (to 9.0% then 7.0%) as the high-demand backlog converts to sales, reflecting a conservative slowdown from peak performance but still benefiting from efficiency and throughput improvements. RV is assumed to grow conservatively at 1.0% then 2.0% as the segment is mature and facing market headwinds.
*   **2028-2030 (Maturity):** Growth is conservatively adjusted down to reflect long-term maturity. Specialty Vehicles is assumed to meet its "GDP+ growth" target (5.0% then 4.0%), while RV growth settles at a low, mature 1.5%.

## III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections (2025-2030)

### A. Net Income Margin Projection

The Net Income (NI) margin is projected to expand conservatively based on the management's guidance of $\sim30$ to $50$ basis points of annual margin expansion in the dominant Specialty Vehicles segment.

| Year | Revenue (in millions) | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $2,425.0 | **4.19%** | $101.5$ (Management Midpoint) |
| **FY 2026** | $2,618.3$ | **4.49%** (+30 bps) | $117.6$ |
| **FY 2027** | $2,788.7$ | **4.79%** (+30 bps) | $133.6$ |
| **FY 2028** | $2,919.1$ | **5.09%** (+30 bps) | $148.6$ |
| **FY 2029** | $3,030.7$ | **5.39%** (+30 bps) | $163.4$ |
| **FY 2030** | $3,145.4$ | **5.69%** (+30 bps) | $179.0$ |

### B. ROIC and Total Net Income (Cash Flow Proxy)

The Net Income for the following year will include a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) component from the prior year's accumulated cash (Net Income).

*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative, yet positive, **10.0%** is used, considering the historical ROIC (e.g., 18.83% mentioned in secondary sources) and the company's focus on capital efficiency.
*   **Net Income for DCF:** The conservative estimate of Net Income for DCF is calculated as: $NI_{year} = Operating NI_{year} + (Cash_{year-1} \times ROIC)$

| Year | Cash (from previous year) (in millions) | ROIC (10.0%) Income (in millions) | Operating NI (in millions) | **NI for DCF (in millions)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $0.0$ | $0.0$ | $101.5$ | **$101.5** |
| **FY 2026** | $101.5$ | $10.2$ | $117.6$ | **$127.8** |
| **FY 2027** | $229.3$ | $22.9$ | $133.6$ | **$156.5** |
| **FY 2028** | $385.8$ | $38.6$ | $148.6$ | **$187.2** |
| **FY 2029** | $573.0$ | $57.3$ | $163.4$ | **$220.7** |
| **FY 2030** | $793.7$ | $79.4$ | $179.0$ | **$258.4** |
| **Total Accumulated Cash** | | | | **$1,052.1** |
| **Terminal Value Base** | | | | **$258.4** |

*Note: Cash (from previous year) is the running sum of all prior years' Net Income for DCF.*

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### A. Discount and Maturity Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable **9.0%** is chosen. This is a higher rate for a mature industrial manufacturer, reflecting potential market volatility and execution risk on the margin expansion goals.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative **2.0%** is used, reflecting a growth rate slightly above long-term inflation in a mature, industrialized economy.

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | NI for DCF (in millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025** | $101.5$ | $0.9174$ | $93.1$ |
| **FY 2026** | $127.8$ | $0.8417$ | $107.6$ |
| **FY 2027** | $156.5$ | $0.7722$ | $120.8$ |
| **FY 2028** | $187.2$ | $0.7084$ | $132.6$ |
| **FY 2029** | $220.7$ | $0.6499$ | $143.4$ |
| **FY 2030** | $258.4$ | $0.5963$ | $154.0$ |
| **Sub-Total NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$751.5$** |

### C. Terminal Value

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model with the FY 2030 cash flow:

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{FY 2030}} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$258.4 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$263.57}{0.07} = \$3,765.3 \text{ million}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value NPV} = \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{FY 2030}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value NPV} = \$3,765.3 \times 0.5963 = \$2,244.6 \text{ million}$$

### D. Total Equity Value

$$\text{Total NPV} = \text{Sub-Total NPV} + \text{Terminal Value NPV}$$

$$\text{Total NPV} = \$751.5 \text{ million} + \$2,244.6 \text{ million} = \$2,996.1 \text{ million}$$

---

## V. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Equity Value} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$

$$\text{Fair Equity Value} = \$2,996.1 \text{ million} + \$36.0 \text{ million} - \$90.0 \text{ million}$$

$$\text{Fair Equity Value} = \$2,942.1 \text{ million}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$2,942.1 \text{ million}}{48.798 \text{ million shares}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \mathbf{\$60.30}$$

---

## VI. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **$60.30** |
| **Current Market Price per Share** | **$\sim\$52.00$** |
| **Difference** | **$+15.96\%$** |

My DCF valuation of **$60.30** per share suggests that REV Group, Inc. is undervalued by the market by approximately 16% based on the conservative business engine assumptions.

### Justification for the Difference (DCF vs. Market Price)

The market price of REVG stock is not primarily driven by an organic DCF valuation, but by the recently announced definitive merger agreement with Terex Corporation (TEX).

1.  **Market's Valuation Basis (The Merger):** The market price of approximately $\$52.00$ per share is a direct reflection of the merger terms. Each share of REVG common stock is to be converted into **$8.71$ in cash plus $0.9809$ shares of TEX common stock.** The total value of this consideration, though subject to the fluctuating price of TEX stock, represents the current *acquisition price* which is the strongest market signal of fair value. The market price is trading at a discount to the implied merger price to reflect the risk that the merger may not close (e.g., regulatory or shareholder non-approval risk, known as "arbitrage spread").

2.  **My DCF Assumption vs. Market's Assumption:**
    *   **DCF Assumption:** My valuation is an *intrinsic* one, assuming the company remains independent and executes on its long-term plan: successfully converting its high Specialty Vehicle backlog into sales, achieving consistent annual margin expansion (30 bps), and maintaining robust ROIC (10.0%) over the long-term. This plan results in significant cash flow growth through 2030, leading to a higher intrinsic value of **$60.30**.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** The market is making a different assumption: that the highest value for shareholders is the *sale* of the company to Terex. The market is pricing the stock not on its potential as an independent entity, but on the *agreed-upon exit price*, with a small discount for deal risk.

**Conclusion:** The DCF value of $60.30$ represents the intrinsic value of REV Group if it were to continue executing its current strategy as an independent, publicly traded entity and successfully delivered on its margin and growth targets. The current market price of $\sim\$52.00$ is a function of the announced merger, and the difference of approximately 16% is due to the market valuing the stock based on the definitive acquisition terms rather than its standalone, long-term intrinsic cash flow potential.
