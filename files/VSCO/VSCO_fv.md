## **II. Business Engine and Financial Projections**

### **1. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)**

The core of Victoria's Secret's "Path to Potential" strategy, as detailed in the last four earnings calls, centers on four key pillars that drive revenue and margin expansion:

1.  **International Expansion:** The International business is a key growth driver, with reported second-quarter 2025 sales up 22% and system-wide retail sales up low double digits, showing particular strength in the China digital channel.
2.  **PINK Turnaround:** The PINK brand is showing sequential improvements with double-digit growth in apparel and significant improvement in new customer acquisition.
3.  **Supercharged Core:** Focus on core product categories, particularly bras, where the company gained market share.
4.  **Brand Modernization:** Evolving the brand projection and go-to-market strategy to deepen connections with existing customers and attract new ones.

**Conservative Revenue Estimates (USD Millions):**

| Year | FY 2024 (Actual) | FY 2025 (Estimate) | FY 2026 | FY 2027 | FY 2028 | FY 2029 | FY 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales** | $6,230$ | $6,370$ | $6,500$ | $6,630$ | $6,763$ | $6,881$ | $6,984$ |
| **Growth Rate** | - | $2.25\%$ | $2.04\%$ | $2.00\%$ | $2.00\%$ | $1.75\%$ | $1.50\%$ |

**Justification for Growth Rates:**

*   **FY 2025:** I use the midpoint of the company’s raised net sales guidance of $6.33 billion to $6.41 billion ($6,370 million). This represents a conservative $2.25\%$ growth over FY 2024.
*   **FY 2026 - FY 2030:** A conservative and gradually decelerating growth profile is assumed, recognizing the challenges of the general retail environment, brand turnaround volatility, and the "conservative in this business engine building" rule. The growth begins at $2.04\%$ and tapers to $1.50\%$ by 2030. This is justified by the positive, albeit early, momentum in international sales and PINK, offset by macro uncertainty and the competitive landscape for intimate apparel.

### **2. Margin and ROIC Assumptions**

| Metric | FY 2024 (Actual) | FY 2025 (Estimate) | FY 2026 - 2030 (Estimate) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating Income Margin** | $4.98\%$ ($310 / $6,230) | $4.63\%$ ($295 / $6,370) | $4.75\%$ | **FY 2025** is based on the midpoint of the adjusted operating income guidance of $270M to $320M ($295M). **FY 2026-2030** assumes slight margin improvement toward a stable long-term margin of $4.75\%$ due to operational efficiencies (e.g., supply chain optimization) and the PINK turnaround, which is partially offset by the estimated $100M net tariff impact in 2025. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | $21.0\%$ | $24.0\%$ | $24.0\%$ | Management guided to a $24-25\%$ adjusted tax rate for FY 2025. I use a conservative $24.0\%$ for all projections. |
| **ROIC on Accumulated Cash** | $15.96\%$ (Historical Baseline) | **$5.0\%$** | **$5.0\%$** | The historical NOPAT-based ROIC is $15.96\%$. To be *very conservative* as per the rule, I use a **$5.0\%$** ROIC, which is a significant haircut but represents the company's ability to generate value from retained earnings (reinvesting cash flow into the business, e.g., store modernizations and technology). |

### **3. Projected Net Income (Free Cash Flow Proxy)**

The valuation uses Net Income as a proxy for free cash flow to equity (FCFE), as per the instruction: "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."

$$
\text{Net Income}_n = (\text{Net Sales}_n \times \text{Operating Margin}_n) \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) + (\text{Accumulated Cash}_{n-1} \times \text{ROIC})
$$

| Year | Net Sales (A) | Oper. Margin | Oper. Income (B) | Tax Rate | NOPAT (C = B * (1-Tax)) | Cash from Prior Year (D) | ROIC | Inc. from ROIC (E = D * ROIC) | Net Income (F = C + E) | Accumulated Cash (D + F) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY24** | 6,230 | $4.98\%$ | 310 | 21.0%* | $244.9$ | - | - | - | $165.0$ (GAAP) | **$188$** |
| **FY25** | 6,370 | $4.63\%$ | 295 | 24.0% | $224.2$ | $188$ | $5.0\%$ | $9.4$ | $233.6$ | **$421.6$** |
| **FY26** | 6,500 | $4.75\%$ | 308.8 | 24.0% | $234.7$ | $421.6$ | $5.0\%$ | $21.1$ | $255.8$ | **$677.4$** |
| **FY27** | 6,630 | $4.75\%$ | 315.4 | 24.0% | $239.7$ | $677.4$ | $5.0\%$ | $33.9$ | $273.6$ | **$951.0$** |
| **FY28** | 6,763 | $4.75\%$ | 321.7 | 24.0% | $244.5$ | $951.0$ | $5.0\%$ | $47.6$ | $292.1$ | **$1,243.1$** |
| **FY29** | 6,881 | $4.75\%$ | 326.8 | 24.0% | $248.4$ | $1,243.1$ | $5.0\%$ | $62.2$ | $310.6$ | **$1,553.7$** |
| **FY30** | 6,984 | $4.75\%$ | 331.7 | 24.0% | $252.1$ | $1,553.7$ | $5.0\%$ | $77.7$ | $329.8$ | **$1,883.5$** |
| **Terminal** | | | | | | | | | | |

*Note: FY24 NOPAT uses GAAP EBIT and a statutory 21% tax rate for a baseline. Projected NOPAT uses projected Op. Margin and the 24% guided tax rate to be conservative.*

## **III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

### **1. Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy): 9.0%**
    *   **Justification:** A conservative rate, higher than the long-term historical market return. This rate is high to reflect the execution risk associated with VSCO’s ongoing brand turnaround, the volatile retail industry, and its high debt-to-equity ratio.
*   **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate): 2.0%**
    *   **Justification:** A very conservative, below-average long-term nominal GDP growth rate. This rate accounts for the company's mature market position, with future growth expected to be only marginally above inflation.

### **2. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the perpetuity growth formula with the final year's NOPAT as the starting point:

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}} = \frac{252.1 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = 3,656.7$$

| Year | Net Income (CF) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25** | $233.6$ | $0.917$ | $214.2$ |
| **FY26** | $255.8$ | $0.842$ | $215.4$ |
| **FY27** | $273.6$ | $0.772$ | $211.3$ |
| **FY28** | $292.1$ | $0.708$ | $206.8$ |
| **FY29** | $310.6$ | $0.650$ | $201.9$ |
| **FY30** | $329.8$ | $0.596$ | $196.7$ |
| **Terminal Value** | $3,656.7$ | $0.596$ | $2,180.5$ |
| **Sum of DCF** | | | **$3,426.8$** |

## **IV. Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value)** | $3,426.8$ |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents** | $188.0$ |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $(1,082.0)$ |
| **Equity Value** | **$2,532.8$** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | $80.16$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$31.60** ($2,532.8 / 80.16$) |

---

## **V. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share (Calculated): $31.60**
**Current Stock Price (Market Value): $34.53**

My conservative DCF valuation suggests that the intrinsic value of Victoria's Secret stock is approximately **$31.60 per share**, which is about $2.93, or **$8.5\%$ lower** than the current market price of $34.53.

### **Analysis of Discrepancy**

The market is making a slightly more optimistic set of assumptions than my conservative model:

1.  **Market Assumes Higher or Accelerated Growth:** My model uses a conservative long-term growth rate of $1.5\%$ to $2.0\%$. The market is likely pricing in a successful acceleration of the "Path to Potential" strategy, expecting the international growth (especially in China) and the PINK brand turnaround to deliver a consistent $3-4\%$ top-line growth for the medium term. My $5.0\%$ ROIC is also very conservative, and the market may anticipate a higher ROIC closer to the $15.96\%$ historical baseline as the company optimizes its capital structure and operations.
2.  **Market Anticipates Stronger Margin Expansion:** My model shows only modest long-term Operating Margin expansion to $4.75\%$, reflecting continued tariff pressure and the competitive market. The market's valuation implies an expectation of a cleaner, more significant margin recovery and operating leverage from the stable, higher revenue base.
3.  **Market Risk Premium is Lower:** My high Discount Rate ($9.0\%$) reflects significant execution risk. The market may view the turnaround as largely successful after the strong Q2 2025 results and has, therefore, assigned a lower risk premium and, consequently, a lower discount rate, which would increase the NPV of future cash flows.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

My Fair Value of **$31.60** represents a **conservative estimate** of the company's intrinsic value, assuming management meets its current year guidance and achieves modest, sustainable growth thereafter while remaining disciplined in capital spending. The minor discount to the current market price suggests that the market is already pricing in some of the upside from the ongoing turnaround, and that the stock is currently **fully valued** based on a conservative model. The $8.5\%$ premium in the stock price can be justified by a slightly higher market-implied growth rate (e.g., $2.5\%$ instead of my $2.0\%$ long-term rate) or a lower perceived risk (e.g., $8.0\%$ discount rate instead of $9.0\%$).
