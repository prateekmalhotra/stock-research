## 2. Revenue and Net Income Projection (2026-2030)

### A. Revenue Growth Assumptions

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | **2.0%** | Conservative (low end) of management's 2%-4% Total Revenue Growth guidance. |
| **2027** | **3.0%** | Reflects increasing success of Customer-Backed Innovation (CBI), which reached 2.4% contribution in 2025. This is conservative relative to the 3%+ long-term goal. Assumes no material F/X or M&A impact. |
| **2028** | **3.0%** | Sustained performance, in line with the long-term CBI objective but conservative at the lower bound of the target. |
| **2029** | **2.5%** | Conservative moderation, reflecting market maturity and competition. |
| **2030** | **2.0%** | Conservative long-term maturity rate for a large, diversified industrial company. |

### B. Margin and ROIC Assumptions

*   **Tax Rate:** **24.0%** (Based on management's projected effective tax rate).
*   **Net Income Margin Expansion:** The primary driver is **Enterprise Initiatives (EI)**. Management expects EI to contribute **100 bps** of margin improvement annually. I will apply this to the Net Income Margin for the initial years and then taper to be conservative.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | 18.99% | FY 2025 Net Income / Revenue (calculated above) |
| **2026** | **19.99%** (+100 bps) | Management guidance of 100 bps from EI. |
| **2027** | **20.49%** (+50 bps) | Tapering of EI contribution to a conservative half of the original guidance. |
| **2028** | **20.99%** (+50 bps) | Continued but reduced margin expansion from structural efficiency. |
| **2029** | **21.24%** (+25 bps) | Further moderation of EI benefit. |
| **2030** | **21.24%** (Flat) | Stable, mature Net Income Margin. |

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** **10.0%**
    *   **Justification:** The company reported an exceptionally high after-tax ROIC of 29.3% in 2025. To adhere to the instruction to use a **conservative** but reasonable ROIC, I will use **10.0%**, which is a high-quality return but a fraction of their recent performance, reflecting extreme conservatism and a long-term normalized return on capital for new investments.

### C. Projected Net Income Calculation (in Millions USD)

| Year | Revenue (A) | Rev Growth (B) | NI Margin (C) | Base NI (D) = A * C | ROIC Income (E) | Total NI (D + E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$16,000.00 | 0.0% | 18.99% | \$3,037.73 | - | **\$3,037.73** |
| **2026** | \$16,320.00 | 2.0% | 19.99% | \$3,262.39 | \$303.77 (3037.73 * 10.0%) | **\$3,566.16** |
| **2027** | \$16,809.60 | 3.0% | 20.49% | \$3,444.27 | \$356.62 (3566.16 * 10.0%) | **\$3,800.89** |
| **2028** | \$17,313.89 | 3.0% | 20.99% | \$3,634.20 | \$380.09 (3800.89 * 10.0%) | **\$4,014.29** |
| **2029** | \$17,742.74 | 2.5% | 21.24% | \$3,768.17 | \$401.43 (4014.29 * 10.0%) | **\$4,169.60** |
| **2030** | \$18,097.59 | 2.0% | 21.24% | \$3,844.75 | \$416.96 (4169.60 * 10.0%) | **\$4,261.71** |

*Note: The calculation assumes Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year, and the additional income is generated by applying the ROIC% to the previous year's Total Net Income.*

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative WACC):** **9.0%**
    *   **Justification:** A conservative, yet reasonable discount rate for a stable, high-quality, diversified industrial conglomerate with a low beta and investment-grade rating. This is slightly above the long-term historical average return of the stock market, reflecting a robust hurdle rate.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.0%**
    *   **Justification:** A very conservative long-term growth rate, which is in line with or slightly below the long-term expected global GDP and inflation, and matches the revenue growth assumption for 2030.

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The *Total Net Income* (which is assumed to be the Free Cash Flow for this valuation model per instructions) is discounted back to the present.

| Year | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (in Millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$3,566.16 | 0.917 | \$3,270.47 |
| **2027** | \$3,800.89 | 0.842 | \$3,200.05 |
| **2028** | \$4,014.29 | 0.772 | \$3,099.99 |
| **2029** | \$4,169.60 | 0.708 | \$2,951.35 |
| **2030** | \$4,261.71 | 0.650 | \$2,770.93 |
| **Subtotal (NPV of Explicit Period)** | - | - | **\$15,292.79** |

### C. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The terminal value calculates the worth of all cash flows after 2030.

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$4,261.71 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$4,346.94}{0.07} = \$62,099.14 \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}_{2030}}{\text{Discount Factor}_{2030}} = \frac{\$62,099.14}{1.689} = \$36,750.00 \text{ million}
$$

*Note on Discount Factor for TV: The discount factor is based on the 2030 discount factor for a 5-year model.*
*Note on Discount Factor for TV (Revised): The TV is calculated at the end of the final explicit year (2030), so it is discounted back 5 years. Discount Factor = $\frac{1}{(1+0.09)^5}$ = 0.650*

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}_{2030}}{(1+\text{Discount Rate})^5} = \frac{\$62,099.14}{(1+0.09)^5} = \$62,099.14 \times 0.650 = \mathbf{\$40,364.44} \text{ million}
$$

### D. Enterprise Value and Equity Value

| Metric | Value (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Explicit Cash Flows** | \$15,292.79 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | \$40,364.44 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **\$55,657.23** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$948.00 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$7,085.00 |
| **Equity Value** | **\$49,520.23** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$49,520.23 \text{ million}}{293.5 \text{ million}} = \mathbf{\$168.72 \text{ per share}}
$$

### B. Comparison to Market Price

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$168.72** |
| **Current Market Price** | **\$288.51** |
| **Valuation Gap** | **-41.5%** |

### C. Justification of the Valuation Gap

The calculated Fair Value of **\$168.72** is **41.5% lower** than the Current Market Price of **\$288.51**. This significant difference suggests that the market is making much more aggressive assumptions about ITW's future growth and profitability than the conservative model has allowed.

**Why the Conservative Valuation is Lower (Market's Implicit Assumptions):**

1.  **Revenue Growth is Too Conservative:**
    *   My model projects long-term growth (2027-2030) at a conservative 3.0%-2.0%.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** The market is likely pricing in a more successful transition to the "Next Phase" strategy, believing ITW will achieve its **3%+ organic growth target** and sustain it well beyond 2030, possibly incorporating a higher impact from new market drivers like electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing. The market may be projecting 4% to 5% long-term revenue growth.

2.  **Margin Expansion is Too Conservative:**
    *   My model conservatively tapers the Enterprise Initiative (EI) contribution from 100 bps in 2026 to 25 bps by 2029.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** The market likely believes the EI's structural improvements and cost discipline will lead to *sustained* 100+ bps of margin expansion (from Enterprise Initiatives) for a longer period (e.g., all the way to 2030), pushing the mature Net Income Margin significantly higher than the projected 21.24%.

3.  **ROIC/Reinvestment Rate is Too Conservative:**
    *   My model uses an extremely conservative 10.0% ROIC on reinvested cash, compared to the company's reported 29.3% in 2025.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** The market is likely modeling a higher reinvestment rate of Net Income and/or a much higher ROIC (e.g., 20%+) on reinvested capital, leading to a much higher growth rate for cash flow.

4.  **Discount Rate is Too High:**
    *   My model uses a high hurdle rate of 9.0%.
    *   **Market's Assumption:** Given ITW's stability, low beta, and best-in-class margins and returns, the market may be applying a lower discount rate (e.g., 7.0%-7.5%), which would significantly inflate the present value of the Terminal Value.

In summary, the market appears to be assigning a **premium valuation** to ITW based on the demonstrable success of its proprietary operating model (ITW Business Model) and the expectation of **sustained, best-in-class financial performance** that will meet or exceed its stated long-term goals for organic growth and margin expansion through its Enterprise Initiatives. The market views ITW as a premium multi-industrial with superior execution, justifying a valuation that our conservative inputs cannot support. For an investor to realize the calculated fair value, there would need to be a significant, sustained failure in the company's core strategic initiatives (CBI and EI) or a major unforeseen recession.
