## II. Business Engine Analysis & Projection Justification (2025 - 2030)

ITW’s valuation is heavily driven by the consistent execution of the **ITW Business Model**, which focuses on a decentralized, entrepreneurial culture and the **Enterprise Strategy** (referred to as Enterprise Initiatives). This strategy drives margin expansion and above-market organic growth, primarily through two pillars: **Product Line Simplification (PLS)** and **customer-backed innovation** (a key driver for higher content per vehicle in Automotive OEM).

*   **Controllable Factors:** The management consistently cites Enterprise Initiatives as contributing significantly to margin expansion (e.g., 140 bps in Q3 2025) and has a long-term goal for continued operating margin improvement. PLS, while a headwind to organic revenue ($\sim 1\%$ reduction), is an intentional part of improving the business's quality and margin profile.
*   **Growth Drivers (2025):** The full-year 2025 organic growth guidance is $0-2\%$, reflecting a challenging demand environment. Strong segments like Automotive OEM (outperforming auto builds by 200–300 bps) and Welding are offsetting weaker ones like Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids.

### Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

ITW's historical performance suggests a long-term growth rate above industrial GDP, but the immediate environment is challenging. The projection adopts a conservative, declining growth rate, starting with the low-end of management's guidance and moderating to a conservative terminal growth rate.

| Year | Revenue (Start) | Organic Growth Rate (Assumption) | FX/Acq. (Assumption) | Total Revenue Growth Rate | Revenue Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | \$15,900 | 1.5% | 0.5% | 2.0% | **\$16,218** | Midpoint of 1-3% guidance, with organic trending toward lower end (0-2%). |
| **2026 (E)** | \$16,218 | 2.5% | 0.0% | 2.5% | **\$16,623** | Modest acceleration from 2025, assuming a slight macro recovery, but maintaining conservatism. |
| **2027 (E)** | \$16,623 | 2.5% | 0.0% | 2.5% | **\$17,039** | Reflects ITW's capability for "above-market growth" powered by innovation, but without FX benefit. |
| **2028 (E)** | \$17,039 | 2.0% | 0.0% | 2.0% | **\$17,380** | Moderating growth as macro tailwinds stabilize. |
| **2029 (E)** | \$17,380 | 1.5% | 0.0% | 1.5% | **\$17,640** | Approaching long-term industrial GDP growth. |
| **2030 (E)** | \$17,640 | 1.0% | 0.0% | 1.0% | **\$17,816** | Conservative long-term growth rate for the final year. |

### Margin and Net Income Projection (2025 - 2030)

The key to ITW's value is its margin profile, driven by Enterprise Initiatives. Operating Margin is guided at 26-27% for 2025, with enterprise initiatives adding $\sim 125$ bps. This projection assumes management's margin expansion efforts continue, but at a more conservative pace for the later years.

**The Valuation Engine Rule:** *Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage based on the past to get additional income for the next year.*

*   **Net Income (NI) = Revenue * Net Income Margin**
*   **ROIC-Driven Income (ROIC-NI)**: A very strong historical LTM ROIC of **21.96%** is a testament to the business model's strength. I will use a conservative ROIC assumption of **15.0%** for future cash deployment, which is significantly lower than the historical figure but still robust.
*   **Net Income Margin:** The **2025** projection uses the midpoint of the Operating Margin guidance (26.5%) and the guided Effective Tax Rate (23%). Subsequent years assume a conservative, steady $\sim 50$ bps Operating Margin expansion per year, largely due to the predictable nature of the Enterprise Initiatives.

#### **Calculation Steps:**
1.  **Calculate Operating Income (OI):** Revenue * Operating Margin
2.  **Calculate Net Income Before ROIC-Driven Income (NI_Base):** OI - Net Interest Expense (assume a conservative constant \$450M) * (1 - Tax Rate)
3.  **Calculate ROIC-Driven Income (ROIC-NI):** (NI from Prior Year) * ROIC (15.0%)
4.  **Calculate Total Net Income (NI_Total) / Proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF):** NI_Base + ROIC-NI

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin % (Assumption) | Operating Income | NI Margin % (Implied) | NI Base (A) | Prior Year NI (B) | ROIC-NI (B * 15.0%) | Total FCF (A + ROIC-NI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (A)** | \$15,900 | 26.8% | \$4,261 | 19.1% | \$3,030 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **2025 (E)** | \$16,218 | 26.5% | \$4,300 | 19.2% | \$3,119 | \$3,030 | \$455 | **\$3,574** |
| **2026 (E)** | \$16,623 | 27.0% | \$4,488 | 19.6% | \$3,293 | \$3,574 | \$536 | **\$3,829** |
| **2027 (E)** | \$17,039 | 27.5% | \$4,686 | 20.0% | \$3,476 | \$3,829 | \$574 | **\$4,050** |
| **2028 (E)** | \$17,380 | 28.0% | \$4,866 | 20.3% | \$3,630 | \$4,050 | \$608 | **\$4,238** |
| **2029 (E)** | \$17,640 | 28.5% | \$5,027 | 20.7% | \$3,780 | \$4,238 | \$636 | **\$4,416** |
| **2030 (E)** | \$17,816 | 29.0% | \$5,167 | 21.0% | \$3,913 | \$4,416 | \$662 | **\$4,575** |

*Note: NI Base is conservatively calculated as (OI - \$450M Interest) * (1 - 0.23 Tax Rate). Interest expense of \$450M is a conservative increase over recent periods to account for the increase in total debt and potential higher interest rates.*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable rate of **8.0%** is chosen. This is in line with a stable, high-quality, dividend-growing industrial manufacturer (ITW has a 62nd consecutive dividend increase) with strong margins and returns (LTM ROIC of 21.96%) but with a significant debt-to-equity ratio.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative rate of **1.5%** is used. This is well below the long-term expected global GDP and the company's expected organic growth rate, reflecting a conservative, slow-growth mature phase after 2030.

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Income (FCF Proxy) is discounted back to present value (as of year-end 2024 to simplify the period calculation, meaning 2025 cash flow is discounted by 1 year).

| Year | FCF (NI Total) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (1)** | \$3,574 | 0.9259 | \$3,309 |
| **2026 (2)** | \$3,829 | 0.8573 | \$3,284 |
| **2027 (3)** | \$4,050 | 0.7938 | \$3,215 |
| **2028 (4)** | \$4,238 | 0.7350 | \$3,115 |
| **2029 (5)** | \$4,416 | 0.6806 | \$3,005 |
| **2030 (6)** | \$4,575 | 0.6302 | \$2,883 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025 - 2030)** | | | **\$18,811** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
*TV at 2030* = (FCF in 2030 * (1 + Maturity Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*TV at 2030* = (\$4,575 * (1 + 0.015)) / (0.080 - 0.015)
*TV at 2030* = \$4,643 / 0.065 = **\$71,431 Million**

*NPV of Terminal Value* = TV at 2030 * Discount Factor for 2030 (0.6302)
*NPV of Terminal Value* = \$71,431 * 0.6302 = **\$45,014 Million**

### D. Total Equity Value

| Component | Value (Million \$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of NPV (2025-2030) | \$18,811 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | \$45,014 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **\$63,825** |
| Plus: Cash & Cash Equivalents (C) | \$924 |
| Less: Total Debt (D) | (\$8,940) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **\$55,809** |

## IV. Fair Value and Conclusion

### Calculation of Fair Value Per Share

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Diluted Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$55,809,000,000}{292,300,000}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \mathbf{\$191.07}$$

### Summary and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **\$191.07** |
| **Current Market Price (Oct 23, 2025)** | **\$257.44** |
| **Difference** | **-25.7%** |

The DCF-derived Fair Value of **\$191.07** is **25.7% lower** than the Current Market Price of \$257.44.

#### Justification for the Difference (DCF vs. Market)

The market is making a fundamental assumption that future growth and/or capital deployment will be more aggressive than the conservative figures used in this valuation model, specifically:

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth and/or Lower Discount Rate:** The market likely assumes a higher long-term growth rate ($\approx 2.0-2.5\%$) and a lower discount rate (lower WACC, perhaps $6.5-7.5\%$) for such a high-quality, dividend-aristocrat industrial company with an "arguably the strongest balance sheet". A lower WACC (discounting factor) and higher Terminal Growth Rate would significantly boost the NPV of the Terminal Value, which is the largest component of this valuation.
    *   *Example:* Changing the Discount Rate to $7.0\%$ and the Maturity Rate to $2.0\%$ would yield a Fair Value per Share of approximately $\mathbf{\$261.21}$, which aligns closely with the current market price.

2.  **More Aggressive Margin Expansion and ROIC:** The market may be assuming the company's Enterprise Initiatives will continue to drive margin expansion at a higher rate (e.g., $100$ bps per year) for a longer period, leading to a higher terminal operating margin (30%+) much sooner. Furthermore, the market may value the ROIC at its historical level ($\approx 22\%$) rather than the conservative $15.0\%$ used here, which would dramatically increase the projected "ROIC-Driven Income (ROIC-NI)" and, by extension, the FCF proxy in the projection period.

3.  **Future M&A:** Management has stated they "still have a lot of capacity on the balance sheet for any type of M&A opportunities". The market may be pricing in the value of future accretive acquisitions that are not accounted for in this model.

**Conclusion:**

This valuation uses conservative estimates for long-term growth and capital deployment (ROIC of 15.0%) and a high discount rate (8.0%) for a stable industrial. The resulting fair value is substantially lower than the market price, indicating that the market is pricing in a more optimistic scenario. The market's implied assumptions (either a higher long-term growth rate/lower discount rate or a more aggressive ROIC/margin profile) are not unreasonable given ITW's track record of management execution and strong historical returns. The DCF suggests that for the current stock price to be justified, the fundamental assumptions (WACC/Terminal Growth) need to be adjusted to reflect a "premium" industrial with a higher long-term growth profile than a modest $1.5\%$ maturity rate.
