# Koito Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (KOTMY) Stock Valuation

## I. Calculation of Net Cash / Net Debt

The valuation is calculated using the latest available consolidated financial data for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (FY2024).

| Line Item | Value (¥ Millions) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** (C) | ¥111,345 | Derived from the cash flow statement for the year ended March 31, 2025. [cite: 3 (from step 2)] |
| **Total Debt** (D) | ¥10,000 | **Conservative Estimate/Assumption.** The company's business report lists total non-consolidated outstanding loans to principal lenders as ¥5.7 billion [cite: 1 (from step 4)]. To be conservative and account for all consolidated, interest-bearing liabilities (short-term & long-term borrowings, capital leases), a round figure of **¥10 billion** is used, reflecting Koito's extremely strong balance sheet and high equity ratio (70.5%) [cite: 2 (from step 4)]. |
| **Net Cash** (C - D) | **¥101,345** | ¥111,345 - ¥10,000 |
| **Shares Outstanding** (S) | 251,005,495 | Calculated from Issued Shares (260,582,115) minus Treasury Shares (9,576,620) as of March 31, 2025. [cite: 3 (from step 2)] |

## II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions (FY2025 - FY2030)

The core of the valuation relies on the management's *1st Medium-Term Management Plan* (FY2025-FY2027) which targets major improvements in profitability driven by new technologies like LED/LiDAR and increased sales to non-Japanese OEMs.

### 1. Revenue Engine & Growth Assumptions

The business engine is primarily driven by:
*   **Volume:** Global vehicle production trends and market share gain with Non-Japanese OEMs.
*   **Price/Mix:** Shifting product mix towards high-value, high-margin products like Adaptive LED Headlamps and the consolidation of the Cepton-LiDAR business [cite: 2 (from step 4)].

| Fiscal Year (Ends Mar 31) | Base Revenue (¥ Billions) | Year-over-Year (YoY) Change | Revenue (¥ Millions) | Justification |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Actual)** | 916.7 | - | 916,709 | Consolidated result. [cite: 2 (from step 4)] |
| **FY2025 (Forecast)** | 868.0 | -5.3% | 868,000 | Management's explicit full-year forecast for FY2025, which reflects a challenging environment with production and shipment suspensions. [cite: 5 (from step 3)] |
| **FY2026** | 933.0 | 7.5% | 933,000 | Interpolated growth to reach the FY2027 target. This high growth is consistent with management's guided CAGR. [cite: 1 (from step 2)] |
| **FY2027 (Target)** | 1,000.0 | 7.2% | 1,000,000 | Management's explicit target of **"¥1 Trillion or more"** in Net Sales for the end of the Medium-Term Plan. [cite: 1 (from step 2)] |
| **FY2028** | 1,030.0 | **3.0%** | 1,030,000 | **Conservative Decline:** A step-down from the aggressive plan period, but sustained by the roll-out of new high-tech products (LiDAR/ADAS). |
| **FY2029** | 1,055.7 | **2.5%** | 1,055,750 | **Conservative Maturity:** Represents growth slightly above long-term inflation, a conservative rate for a global auto parts leader. |
| **FY2030** | 1,082.6 | **2.5%** | 1,082,644 | **Conservative Maturity.** |

### 2. Margin and ROIC Assumptions

The core assumption is the successful execution of the management plan to significantly boost operating margins, which had been low in the base year.

| Fiscal Year | OPM Target [cite: 1 (from step 2)] | **Net Income Margin** (NIM) | Justification |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Actual)** | 4.9% | 5.04% | Base year (Net Income ¥46.24B / Net Sales ¥916.7B). [cite: 2 (from step 4)] |
| **FY2025 (Forecast)** | 4.3% | 4.42% | Management's OPM forecast (4.3%) [cite: 5 (from step 3)] adjusted by the FY2024 NIM/OPM ratio (1.028). |
| **FY2026** | 6.2% | 6.38% | Interpolated increase towards the ambitious FY2027 target. |
| **FY2027 - FY2030** | 8.0% | **8.22%** | Management's explicit OPM target of **8%** [cite: 1 (from step 2)], consistently applied as a conservative long-term cap. |
| **ROIC Assumption** | **9.0%** | - | Management's target of **"9% or more"** is used as a conservative reinvestment rate for existing cash flows. [cite: 1 (from step 2)] |

---

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income is used as the cash flow for the valuation, adjusted by the ROIC earned on the previous year's accumulated cash (as per the rule).

**DCF Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is consistent with the company's own ROIC target and a low-risk WACC for a highly capitalized global market leader.
*   **Perpetuity Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** **1.5%**. This is a conservative assumption, below the global economic average and the company's long-term revenue growth rate, reflecting maturity.

### Projected Net Income (Cash Flow)

$$ \text{Cash Flow}_{\text{n}} = (\text{Revenue}_{\text{n}} * \text{NIM}_{\text{n}}) + (\text{Cash}_{\text{n-1}} * \text{ROIC}) $$

| FY (Ends Mar 31) | Revenue (A) (¥ MM) | NIM (B) (%) | Net Income (A * B) (¥ MM) | Cash from Previous Year (C) (¥ MM) | ROIC (D) (%) | ROIC Income (C * D) (¥ MM) | **Total Cash Flow (E)** (¥ MM) | NPV (9.0% Discount) (¥ MM) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2024 (Base)** | 916,709 | 5.04% | 46,240 | 111,345 (Start Cash) | - | - | **46,240** | - |
| **FY2025** | 868,000 | 4.42% | 38,369 | 111,345 | 9.0% | 10,021 | **48,390** | 44,394 |
| **FY2026** | 933,000 | 6.38% | 59,520 | 159,735 | 9.0% | 14,376 | **73,896** | 62,176 |
| **FY2027** | 1,000,000 | 8.22% | 82,200 | 233,631 | 9.0% | 21,027 | **103,227** | 79,664 |
| **FY2028** | 1,030,000 | 8.22% | 84,666 | 336,858 | 9.0% | 30,317 | **114,983** | 81,424 |
| **FY2029** | 1,055,750 | 8.22% | 86,707 | 451,841 | 9.0% | 40,666 | **127,373** | 82,752 |
| **FY2030** | 1,082,644 | 8.22% | 88,881 | 579,214 | 9.0% | 52,129 | **141,010** | 84,008 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025 - 2030)** | | | | | | | | **¥434,418 Million** |

*Note: Cash (C) is the cumulative sum of Total Cash Flow from the previous year, assuming all net income flows to cash (as per rule).*

### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The terminal value captures the value of all cash flows after 2030 (Year 6).

$$ \text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} = \frac{¥141,010 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.09 - 0.015} = ¥1,911,436 \text{ Million} $$

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV TV):**

$$ \text{NPV TV} = \frac{\text{Terminal Value}}{(1 + \text{WACC})^{6}} = \frac{¥1,911,436 \text{ Million}}{(1 + 0.09)^{6}} = ¥1,139,185 \text{ Million} $$

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

| Line Item | Value (¥ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sum of DCF NPV (FY2025-2030)** | ¥434,418 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | ¥1,139,185 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **¥1,573,603** |
| Less: Total Debt | -¥10,000 |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | +¥111,345 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **¥1,674,948** |
| Divide by: Shares Outstanding | 251,005,495 |
| **Fair Value per Share (JPY)** | **¥6,672** |

## V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Fair Value (JPY) | Current Market Value (JPY) | Current Market Value (USD) | Implied Upside |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price per Share** | **¥6,672** | ¥2,128 | $15.20 | 213% |

*   *Current Market Price (JPY) is calculated as $15.20 (KOTMY price) multiplied by the company's stated exchange rate of ¥140.0/$1.00.* [cite: 1 (from step 3), 2 (from step 4)]

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **¥6,672** is significantly higher (over 200% upside) than the implied current market value of **¥2,128**. This wide discrepancy is primarily due to different assumptions regarding the successful execution of the management's ambitious turnaround plan.

**Market's Assumptions (Why the stock is low):**

1.  **Skepticism on Margin Improvement:** The market is likely heavily discounting the company's ability to achieve an **8% Operating Profit Margin (OPM)** by FY2027, given the FY2024 actual OPM was only 4.9% [cite: 2 (from step 4)] and the FY2025 forecast OPM is even lower at 4.3% [cite: 5 (from step 3)]. The automotive supply chain is a low-margin, high-volume business, and a nearly doubling of the margin is a massive leap in profitability.
2.  **Weak Core Market:** The stock is likely being valued as a traditional Japanese automotive supplier heavily reliant on Japanese OEMs (Toyota/Honda/Nissan account for over 50% of sales), a sector facing slow growth and intense pressure from the shift to Electric Vehicles (EVs) [cite: 1 (from step 2)]. The market is not giving credit for the diversification and the high-tech LiDAR/ADAS strategy.
3.  **Conservative Valuation:** As an ADR traded on the OTC market, KOTMY often trades at a discount due to lower liquidity and awareness compared to its TSE listing.

**My Assumptions (Why the Fair Value is high):**

1.  **Management Guidance is Truth:** The valuation strictly adheres to the rule of using management's explicit guidance as *truth*, specifically the **8% OPM** and **9% ROIC** targets for the end of the medium-term plan [cite: 1 (from step 2)]. These targets, if achieved, fundamentally change the earnings power of the company.
2.  **High-Tech Catalyst:** The valuation assumes successful market penetration and high-margin revenue from the *new business engine* components: high-end lighting (Adaptive LED) and the **LiDAR business** (Cepton consolidation), which are the actual drivers of the projected margin expansion [cite: 2 (from step 4)].
3.  **Rock-Solid Balance Sheet:** The valuation explicitly reflects the company's massive net cash position (over ¥101 billion) which provides a strong cushion against market shocks and funds the necessary CapEx for the technological shift.

### Justification

The Fair Value of **¥6,672** is justified by the successful execution of the *1st Medium-Term Management Plan*. The market is currently valuing Koito Manufacturing based on its legacy auto supplier earnings profile (low margin, high volume), while the DCF is valuing the company on its **future high-tech profile** (high margin, new product revenue streams) as guided by management. The key to realizing this value is the margin expansion from **4.9% to 8.22% (NIM)**, which, if achieved, fundamentally proves the current market valuation to be a major undervaluation.
