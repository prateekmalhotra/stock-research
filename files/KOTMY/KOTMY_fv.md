### II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

Koito's business engine is dominated by **Automotive Lighting (93.8% of sales)**. The future growth is driven by:
1.  **Increased Content per Vehicle (ASP):** The accelerated shift from traditional to high-value-added lighting systems, primarily **LED Headlamps** and the introduction of **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)/LiDAR integration**.
2.  **LiDAR Business:** The new high-growth segment from the consolidation of Cepton and securing new orders from a global OEM for Level 4 autonomous driving vehicles.
3.  **Global Automotive Production Volume:** A conservative assumption of slow, stable volume growth.

| Metric | FY2025 (E) | FY2026 (E) | FY2027 (E) | FY2028 (E) | FY2029 (E) | FY2030 (E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative Revenue Growth Rate** | 4.0% | 4.5% | 4.0% | 3.5% | 3.0% | 2.5% |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 5.10% | 5.20% | 5.30% | 5.35% | 5.40% | 5.40% |
| **ROIC on Prior Year's Net Income (%)** | 6.5% | 6.5% | 6.5% | 6.5% | 6.5% | 6.5% |

#### Justification of Estimates:

*   **Revenue Growth:** The growth is anchored in high-value product adoption (LED/LiDAR). The initial rate (4.0-4.5%) is slightly higher than conservative global auto production growth (1-2%) to account for the increasing ASP driven by new technology adoption (LiDAR, ADAS integration) and the continued shift to LED, aligning with management's focus on high-value products. The rate is conservatively tapered down to 2.5% by FY2030, reflecting an anticipated maturation of the LED adoption cycle.
*   **Net Income Margin:** The FY2024 margin was 5.04%. I project a very conservative, gradual improvement to 5.40% by FY2029-2030. This slow increase is justified by **cost rationalization efforts** and the inherent **higher margin of innovative products** (LiDAR/ADAS lighting) but is heavily conservative given the volatility and competition in the Tier 1 auto supplier market.
*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** A conservative 6.5% is used, slightly below the historical FY2024 ROE of 7.1%. This return is applied to the previous year's retained Net Income (cash) to model the value-add of cash reinvestment.

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

#### A. DCF Assumptions

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** 9.0%
    *   *Justification:* A large, established, global automotive parts supplier like Koito has a relatively stable, moderate risk profile. 9.0% is a conservative yet reasonable WACC, higher than the cost of capital for a low-risk, pure-play industrial firm to account for cyclical automotive demand and technology disruption risk.
*   **Conservative Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0%
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative, long-term growth rate, slightly above the long-term inflation goal of many developed economies and appropriate for a mature but technologically forward-looking auto components manufacturer.

#### B. Projected Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (¥ millions)

| Year | Revenue (¥m) | Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income (¥m) from Operations | Income from Prior Cash (ROIC) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (¥m) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2024 (Actual)** | 916,709 | 5.04% | 46,240 | - | - | - | - |
| **FY2025** | 953,377 | 5.10% | 48,622 | 3,006 | **51,628** | 0.9174 | 47,351 |
| **FY2026** | 996,252 | 5.20% | 51,805 | 3,356 | **55,161** | 0.8417 | 46,432 |
| **FY2027** | 1,036,102 | 5.30% | 54,913 | 3,585 | **58,498** | 0.7722 | 45,174 |
| **FY2028** | 1,072,366 | 5.35% | 57,377 | 3,792 | **61,169** | 0.7084 | 43,337 |
| **FY2029** | 1,104,537 | 5.40% | 59,645 | 3,976 | **63,621** | 0.6499 | 41,349 |
| **FY2030** | 1,132,150 | 5.40% | 61,136 | 4,135 | **65,271** | 0.5963 | 38,913 |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | | | | |
| **Total NPV of Project Period** | | | | | | | **262,556** |

*Note on Income from Prior Cash:* $Net\ Income\ (ROIC) = (Net\ Income\ from\ previous\ year \times 6.5\%)$. For example, in FY2025: $46,240 \times 6.5\% \approx 3,006$.

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal cash flow is assumed to grow at a conservative perpetual rate of 2.0%.
1.  **Terminal Cash Flow (2031):** $FY2030\ Net\ Income \times (1 + g) = ¥65,271 \times (1 + 0.02) = ¥66,576$ million
2.  **Terminal Value (at FY2030):** $Terminal\ Cash\ Flow / (WACC - g) = ¥66,576 / (0.09 - 0.02) = ¥951,086$ million
3.  **NPV of Terminal Value:** $Terminal\ Value \times Discount\ Factor\ (FY2030) = ¥951,086 \times 0.5963 = ¥567,114$ million

**Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

$TEV = NPV\ of\ Project\ Period\ Cash\ Flows + NPV\ of\ Terminal\ Value$
$TEV = ¥262,556 \text{ million} + ¥567,114 \text{ million} = ¥829,670 \text{ million}$

### V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (USD)** | **$23.65** |
| **Current Market Price (KOTMY ADR)** | $14.77$ |
| **Valuation Difference** | **+60.12%** |

#### Justification of Difference

The calculated **Fair Value of $23.65 per share** is **60.12% higher** than the Current Market Price of $14.77 per share.

**Reasons for Market Disparity (Why the Market is more conservative):**

1.  **Cyclical Industry Discount:** As a Tier 1 automotive supplier, Koito's revenues and profits are highly cyclical and tied to global auto production volume, which the market often discounts due to recession risk and slow growth prospects.
2.  **Conservative Margin/ROIC Assumptions:** The market may be projecting a lower future Net Income Margin than my modestly increasing assumption (from 5.04% to 5.40%). Persistent commodity price volatility and increased R&D spending on new technologies (LiDAR, ADAS) could continue to pressure margins, and the market may be pricing in a static or declining margin.
3.  **LiDAR Risk Discount:** While my model incorporates revenue growth from high-value products like LiDAR, the market may view this new business line with caution. The LiDAR market is highly competitive and nascent, and Koito's investment in Cepton and new orders carry the risk of technological obsolescence or integration failure, leading to a much lower Terminal Growth Rate or higher Discount Rate assumption by the market.
4.  **Cash Reinvestment Scepticism:** The market may not give full credit for the ROIC assumption (6.5%) on the large cash pile. If Koito merely holds this cash without deploying it for high-return projects, the market's internal valuation of this liquid asset's earning power would be near zero (or T-bill rates), making the NPV lower than my calculation.
5.  **Weak JPY/ADR Price Discrepancy:** While my calculation uses a recent JPY/USD rate, the market price for the KOTMY ADR ($14.77) may not perfectly reflect the JPY share price (¥2,601) due to structural ADR/OTC trading discounts and the market's long-term bearish view on the Japanese Yen's strength.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

My valuation is a **conservative yet optimistic perspective** on Koito's ability to successfully execute its strategic pivot to high-value-added lighting systems and capitalize on the shift to autonomous driving (LiDAR). The $\text{¥3,705.61}$ per share valuation suggests the market is not fully appreciating the potential long-term value from the embedded high-growth (LiDAR) segment, or is applying an overly punitive risk premium due to the cyclicality of the core auto parts business. For Koito to reach the calculated Fair Value, it must demonstrate consistent execution of its LiDAR strategy and successfully translate its market dominance in traditional lighting into a dominant position in next-generation ADAS/autonomous vehicle components.
