## Business Summary

Newmont Corporation’s core business model involves finding, developing, and operating massive mines worldwide, primarily to extract gold, though they also produce supplementary metals like copper and silver. The company invests huge amounts of capital into exploration and construction before extracting the raw ore and processing it into refined metals, like gold bullion. The company then sells these commodities in the global market. Their customers are typically large institutional buyers, such as central banks, financial institutions that hold gold as an investment, and industrial manufacturers like jewelers. Revenue is overwhelmingly dominated by the sale of gold, which is driven globally by investment sentiment and economic uncertainty.

## Business Model Risk

Newmont faces substantial near-term risk from the rapid volatility of the gold price, which is unpredictable and has historically caused immediate drops in profitability when prices fall due to factors like rising interest rates. High operating costs are also a persistent near-term threat, as inflation significantly increases the expenses for energy, labor, and chemicals needed to run the complex mining process, shrinking profit margins even if the gold price remains stable. For the long term, a major threat is geopolitical instability; since the mines are spread globally, political changes, increased taxes, or the threat of nationalization in certain countries could destroy the value of long-term assets. Finally, the company must continually replace the gold it mines by successfully finding new, profitable reserves; failure to discover or acquire enough new gold deposits (resource risk) is a critical long-term concern that would lead to the eventual shrinking of the company.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on Newmont Corporation (NEM), the world's largest gold mining company.

***

### **Part 1: Inception and Early Years (1916-1960s)**

1.  **The Founding Purpose:** Newmont was founded in 1916 by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company, which is essentially an investment fund. Its initial goal was not just to operate mines, but to manage Thompson's vast private investments across various natural resources, including oil, gas, and diverse minerals.

2.  **The Name:** Thompson, who made his fortune in New York but grew up in Montana, combined the names of his two homes to create "Newmont."

3.  **Early Diversification:** The company’s investments were widespread, including a major stake in Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, interests in copper, and oil and gas fields in Texas and Louisiana. For decades, Newmont was as much an investment firm as a mining operator.

4.  **Weathering a Major Headwind:** When the Great Depression hit in 1929, Newmont survived by focusing on its gold assets, which held their value better than other investments at the time. In the 1930s, the US government increased the fixed price of gold, which provided a major financial tailwind that helped the company grow steadily.

5.  **A Pivotal Discovery:** In 1965, Newmont began mining in Carlin, Nevada, after its geologists discovered what is now known as the "Carlin Trend," which turned out to be the largest gold discovery in North America in the 20th century. This massive, high-quality asset became the foundation for the company's future identity.

***

### **Part 2: The Focus on Gold (1980s–2000s)**

1.  **A Strategic Shift:** In the 1980s, Newmont made a key strategic move, deciding to sell off most of its non-gold businesses, such as its interests in copper and coal. This decision streamlined the company and focused its entire effort on becoming a premier gold producer.

2.  **Innovating for Cost-Efficiency:** After this strategic shift, the company focused on developing its mining and exploration capabilities to increase its gold reserves and production capacity globally. A significant step was taken in 2007 when Newmont eliminated its "hedge book"—a complex financial strategy used to lock in future gold prices—to become the world's largest unhedged gold producer. This meant the company was betting on, and fully exposed to, the rising price of gold, giving it a major financial advantage during gold price rallies.

3.  **Leading on Corporate Responsibility:** Newmont took an early leadership role in sustainability, becoming the first gold company to be included in the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in 2007. This set a high standard for how the company managed its environmental and social impact.

***

### **Part 3: Growth, Global Leadership, and Modern Challenges (2019-Present)**

1.  **Massive Acquisitions for Scale (Tailwind Strategy):** Newmont leveraged its size and financial strength to complete two of the largest mergers in the gold sector. It acquired Goldcorp in 2019 and Newcrest Mining in 2023, instantly strengthening its position as the world's largest gold miner. These moves gave the company a vast and globally diverse portfolio of long-life mines.

2.  **Addressing Cost Headwinds with Innovation:** To deal with the complexity and high operating costs of these new mega-mines, Newmont uses a process called **"Full Potential."** This is an internal, continuous improvement program designed to identify simple, site-level fixes—like optimizing truck routes or making processing equipment run better—to lower costs and increase efficiency across its global network. For example, they used technology to allow one operator to remotely control an underground loader, which improved safety and working time.

3.  **Dealing with Social and Environmental Headwinds:** Newmont has faced significant headwinds, including conflicts with local communities over land rights, water use, and the problem of illegal mining activities in its operating areas. Their solution has been to adopt a formal commitment to responsible mining, including transparent community engagement, environmental stewardship, and a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. They even issued the first sustainability-linked bond in the mining industry, tying their financial strategy directly to their environmental goals.

4.  **Current Goal and Core Business:** Today, Newmont’s stated purpose is **"to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining."** The company's goal is to remain the global leader in gold production, operating safely, profitably, and responsibly, while also producing silver, copper, zinc, and lead as byproducts.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Newmont Corporation (NEM) is not built on unique products or customer loyalty but rather on massive, hard-to-replicate advantages related to its sheer **scale, the quality of its mines, and global reach**.

Here is an analysis of Newmont's competitive advantages:

### The Moat: Uniqueness and Differentiation

1.  **Scale as a Cost Advantage (Economies of Scale):** Newmont is the world's largest gold mining company, a position solidified by the 2023 acquisition of Newcrest Mining. This massive size allows the company to operate more efficiently, negotiate better prices from suppliers (like equipment and energy), and spread fixed costs across a larger production volume.
2.  **Portfolio of "Tier 1" Assets:** The company focuses on owning and operating "Tier 1" mines, which are defined as large-scale, long-life (over 10 years), and low-cost assets, typically ranking in the lower half of the industry cost curve. This portfolio of high-quality, long-term mines provides a durable cost advantage over competitors.
3.  **Massive and Long-Life Reserve Base:** Newmont has one of the largest gold reserve bases in the industry, estimated to provide a clear outlook for production stability for approximately two decades. This ensures a long-term stream of production and is extremely difficult for a new competitor to assemble.
4.  **Geographic and Product Diversification:** Its operations are spread across multiple stable continents, including North America, Australia, South America, and Africa, which acts as a natural shield against geopolitical, regulatory, or operational risks in any single country. It also produces copper, silver, zinc, and lead in addition to gold, adding resilience against the volatility of the gold-only market.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **No Special Pricing Power:** Gold is a commodity product, meaning one company's gold is exactly the same as another's. Therefore, Newmont has virtually no control over the market price of gold.
2.  **Special Position in the Market:** Its special position is its ability to be a **low-cost producer** within a commodity market. By focusing on low-cost Tier 1 assets, Newmont ensures profitability even if the price of gold drops to a level that would bankrupt higher-cost competitors.
3.  **Product Differentiation:** The products themselves (gold, copper, etc.) are commodities and are not truly differentiated from a customer's perspective. The competitive differentiation comes from the company's operational excellence in *how* it extracts the minerals.

### Growth and Moat Reinforcement

1.  **Reason for Growth and Moat Reinforcement (Acquisitions):** Newmont's growth into the world's largest gold miner is primarily due to **strategic, large-scale acquisitions** like Goldcorp in 2019 and Newcrest Mining in 2023. These deals immediately boosted its production capacity, consolidated the best assets in the industry, and cemented its scale-based advantage.
2.  **Focus on Capital Discipline:** The company continually optimizes its portfolio by selling off non-core, smaller, or higher-cost assets to focus capital on the most profitable Tier 1 mines. This disciplined approach ensures that capital is reinvested to maintain a *low-cost* position.
3.  **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Leadership:** Newmont's public commitment and investment in leading sustainability and social practices is becoming a competitive advantage. This attracts ESG-focused capital, improves community relations, and can help secure long-term mining permits in key jurisdictions.

### Displacement and Customer Stickiness

1.  **Displacement by Competitors:** Newmont is **extremely difficult to displace** by a competitor with more capital, as the biggest hurdles are not just money, but time and resource scarcity. Even with vast capital, a competitor cannot simply buy or discover a comparable global portfolio of low-cost, long-life Tier 1 assets overnight. A new player would have to spend decades in risky, expensive exploration or wait for a major acquisition opportunity.
2.  **Customer/Contracts Stickiness (Transactional):** Customer relationships are generally **transactional, not sticky.** Newmont sells its product, typically doré bars or refined metal, to refiners, central banks, and industrial users in the global commodity market. The customers buy gold based on price, quality assurance, and delivery, and there is little loyalty or switching cost to bind them to one miner.
3.  **Investment in R&D and Innovation:** Newmont does invest significantly in technology and exploration (e.g., $352 million in 2023) to sustain its competitive edge. This R&D is mostly focused on **exploration** to find and prove new reserves and **operational technologies** (like automation and advanced data analytics) to constantly improve efficiency and lower costs at existing mines. It must *constantly innovate* in these areas to counteract the natural decline of ore grades and rising global operating costs.

## Catalyst Analysis

Newmont Corporation (NEM) catalysts are driven by a combination of favorable gold market conditions, management's strategic focus on its best assets, and returning cash to shareholders.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Gold Price Movement:** As a gold miner, Newmont's stock price is directly linked to the price of gold, which has been in a strong rally. Continued strength or increases in the market price of gold and copper will directly boost its revenue and cash flow.
2.  **Strong Earnings and Free Cash Flow:** Delivering a strong performance in the upcoming Q3 2025 earnings report (expected Oct 23, 2025), following the record quarterly free cash flow of \$1.7 billion achieved in Q2 2025, can provide a significant positive shock to the stock.
3.  **Shareholder Returns Program:** The company's focus on returning capital is a key catalyst. Newmont's board approved an additional \$3 billion to the share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to \$6 billion, which reduces the number of shares outstanding and can support the stock price.
4.  **Successful Project Start-up:** The recent first gold pour at the Ahafo North project in Ghana (September 2025) is a near-term milestone that will begin adding new, lower-cost production to the portfolio as it ramps up.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)

1.  **Portfolio Rebalancing and Operational Focus:** The completion of the non-core asset divestiture program, which generated over \$3.0 billion in cash, allows the company to concentrate its capital and resources on its highest-quality, long-life, and lowest-cost "Tier One" mines.
2.  **Improved Operational Execution:** Successful execution and ramp-up of key development projects, such as the Cadia Panel Caves and Tanami Expansion 2, are expected to support future production growth and maintain the company's industry-leading gold reserves.
3.  **Leadership Continuity and Change:** The planned CEO transition in January 2026, with President and COO Natascha Viljoen taking over, is seen as a sign of continuity for the strategy of operational excellence and cost management.
4.  **Strengthening the Balance Sheet:** The long-term strategy includes ongoing debt reduction, with Newmont already having retired \$1.4 billion in debt in 2025, which improves the company's financial stability and flexibility.

### Management's Explicit Commentary and Strategy (from Recent Earnings Calls)

*   **Free Cash Flow Strategy:** CEO Tom Palmer stated in the Q2 2025 call that the record free cash flow achieved "underscores the quality and potential of the world-class portfolio" they have assembled.
*   **Capital Allocation:** Management's strategy "prioritizes free cash flow growth, balance sheet strength, and shareholder returns." In the Q2 2025 call, they highlighted that they "continue to advance our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes strengthening our balance sheet through ongoing debt reductions and returning capital to shareholders through a predictable dividend and continued share repurchases."
*   **Outlook and Guidance:** The company confirmed it remains "on track to meet its full-year guidance for production, costs, and capital allocation," leveraging the momentum from core managed operations in the first half of the year to build a stable future.
*   **Operational Discipline:** The appointment of a new CEO, who was previously the President and COO, is designed for "continuity" and keeps attention on "output growth as a near-term driver" of the company's operational goals.

1.  **CEO Background and Tenure:** Tom Palmer has served as CEO since October 2019 and has been with Newmont since 2014, previously holding senior roles at Rio Tinto for 20 years. He is only the 10th CEO in Newmont's over 100-year history.
2.  **Track Record of Strategic Transformation:** Palmer's tenure is defined by executing three major transactions: the successful acquisition of Goldcorp (2019), the establishment of the Nevada Gold Mines Joint Venture (2019), and the landmark acquisition of Newcrest Mining (November 2023). These moves have strategically reshaped the company and cemented its position as the world's largest gold producer.
3.  **Delivering on Portfolio Streamlining:** Management successfully completed a non-core asset divestiture program, selling operations like Porcupine and Akyem, which generated over $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds by the first half of 2025. This delivery aligns with the promise to create a leaner portfolio focused on "Tier 1 assets".
4.  **Shareholder Value Creation:** Management has focused on returning capital to shareholders, implementing a $3 billion share repurchase program running through October 2026 and distributing roughly $2 billion through dividends and buybacks since the start of 2025. The management's execution in portfolio optimization is cited by analysts as a key factor in the stock's strong performance and rising valuation estimates.
5.  **Performance and Promises:** The company delivered a record first quarter free cash flow of $1.2 billion in Q1 2025 and is on track to meet its 2025 guidance, demonstrating strong operational execution and a focus on cost management and efficiency gains.

### **Future Management and Succession**

1.  **Planned Leadership Transition:** Tom Palmer will retire on December 31, 2025, as part of a long-term leadership succession plan. He will remain as a Strategic Advisor until March 31, 2026, to ensure a smooth hand-off.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Newmont Corporation's (NEM) DEF 14A proxy statements and related filings, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

#### **1. Insider Ownership**

*   **Low Percentage Ownership:** The overall direct individual insider ownership (managers and directors) is a relatively low percentage of total shares outstanding, ranging from approximately 0.05% to 0.43%. A higher percentage of direct ownership is generally preferred as it indicates deeper personal alignment with shareholder capital risk.
*   **Significant Personal Holdings:** Despite the low percentage, the CEO holds a substantial direct financial stake in the company, reported at approximately $6.5 million worth of shares. This represents a significant personal investment that links their wealth directly to the company's long-term stock performance.
*   **Director Compensation in Stock:** Non-employee Directors are compensated with a substantial portion of their annual retainer in common stock or Director Stock Units (DSUs), requiring them to hold equity and share the same risk/reward as shareholders.

#### **2. Compensation Structure (Pay Mix)**

*   **At-Risk and Equity-Heavy Mix:** The executive compensation program is heavily weighted towards "at-risk" pay, with **stock-based long-term incentives (LTI)** representing the largest component, which is a strong indicator of intent to align with sustained shareholder interests.
*   **Incentives vs. Base Salary:** For executive officers, the target incentive-based compensation (Short-Term Incentive Plan or STIP and LTI) is designed to be a significantly greater multiple of the fixed base salary, further emphasizing performance-based pay.

#### **3. Incentive Metrics (What They Are Paid For)**

*   **Long-Term Incentives (LTI):** The LTI program primarily uses Performance Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), directly linking the largest part of an executive's potential pay to the future stock price.
*   **Balanced Performance Measures:** The incentive metrics include a balanced mix of operational, financial, and shareholder-focused goals, such as:
    *   **Shareholder Return:** Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)
    *   **Financial Health:** Attributable Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Return on Capital Employed
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** Adjusted Cash Sustaining Costs per Gold Equivalent Ounce
    *   **Strategic Growth:** Newcrest Integration Synergies (following the major acquisition)

#### **4. Shareholder Alignment and Governance**

*   **Mandatory Share Retention:** The company requires officers to adhere to a revised share ownership standard, mandating that they hold 50% of vested shares until they achieve their target ownership level. This enforces long-term holding and prevents immediate "sell-and-cash-out" behavior.
*   **Clawback Provisions:** Newmont has expanded its clawback policy to include the recovery of cash payments (like signing bonuses) and time-based equity awards, in addition to performance-based pay, for unethical or misconduct-related behavior. This acts as a deterrent against excessive risk-taking and encourages ethical conduct.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

**Newmont's management has **enough incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders, but the low overall insider ownership could be a point of concern.**

1.  **Alignment with Shareholders:** The compensation structure is strongly aligned with shareholder interests, as the vast majority of executive pay is **performance-based and equity-linked** through PSUs and RSUs.
2.  **Long-Term Focus:** The combination of stock-based LTI, share retention requirements, and the inclusion of Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) as a metric encourages executives to focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains.
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** The expanded clawback provisions and the balance of operational, financial, and stock-market metrics help mitigate incentives for excessive risk-taking to line their own pockets, which is a sign of good governance.
4.  **Area for Scrutiny:** The low percentage of overall insider ownership (less than 0.5% of the company) suggests that management's financial interest is not as deeply tied to the company's capital structure as a higher-ownership model would indicate. This factor somewhat reduces the "skin in the game" despite the robust compensation structure.

## Price History

Based on a recent analysis of Newmont Corporation's (NEM) price history and technical indicators (as of mid-October 2025):

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** With a recent trading price around $93.58 and a 52-week low of $36.86, Newmont Corporation's stock is currently trading approximately **154%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis Status (Trading Low?):** The stock is **not trading low** based on technical analysis; rather, it has a bullish momentum with a "strong buy" or "buy" rating from technical analysis platforms like TradingView. Technical indicators show a long-term uptrend, as the stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).

3.  **Overbought Technical Signal:** A potential caution is that the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been reported as "extremely overbought" (around 77). While this traditionally signals a potential correction, the strong underlying uptrend makes a major correction less probable in the short term, with some analysts setting a short-term target of $100-$120.

4.  **Significant Stock Surge Explanation:** The stock has been up "bigly," with a surge of approximately 62% in the past six months and over 122% year-to-date. This rally is primarily driven by **gold prices soaring to record highs** (over $4,000 per ounce) as investors seek safe-haven assets amid global economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

5.  **Company-Specific Drivers:** The massive gain is further supported by Newmont’s strong earnings, operational efficiency, and progress on key growth projects like the Ahafo North expansion. As the world’s largest gold producer with one of the lowest all-in sustaining costs, the company is highly leveraged to the rising price of gold.

6.  **Recent Drop Example:** The stock experienced a significant drop of 7.6% on one trading day following a retreat in gold prices from their record levels, illustrating the strong correlation and volatility between NEM and the price of the precious metal.

## Long Thesis

Newmont is the safest and most leveraged way to invest in gold because its massive scale and focus on owning the world's best, cheapest, and longest-lasting mines allow it to generate extraordinary profits when gold prices are high. In the near term, the company is acting as a cash machine: record gold prices are leading to record ready cash profits, which management is dedicating to a massive share repurchase program ($6 billion) that aggressively boosts the value of the remaining shares. The company is also selling off all non-essential and high-cost mines to focus capital on its highest-quality assets. In the long term, the recent acquisition of Newcrest reinforces Newmont's position as the undisputed global leader. No competitor can match its vast supply of reserves, which guarantees low-cost production for decades. This dominant scale, combined with continuous internal cost-cutting efforts and a stable management transition, will ensure sustained market leadership and strong returns regardless of minor fluctuations in the price of gold.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The bull case assumes that the price of gold remains elevated or continues to rise, driven by global uncertainty. Management must successfully integrate the massive Newcrest assets and deliver the promised cost savings from that deal. Furthermore, key expansion projects (like Ahafo North and Cadia Panel Caves) must begin production on time and at the projected low operating costs to reinforce the company's competitive advantage.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key flaws and counter-arguments to the bullish thesis for Newmont Corporation (NEM), forming the basis for a bear case.

## Critique of the Long Thesis (Bear Case)

### 1. Challenge to "Cheapest Mines" and "Extraordinary Profits"

*   **Elevated and Rising Costs:** The core premise of operating the "cheapest" mines is undermined by Newmont's All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC), which have been trending higher, reaching an all-time high earlier in 2025. Management is reportedly initiating a sweeping, high-stakes cost-cutting program, including potential large-scale layoffs of thousands of employees, which suggests the current cost structure is fundamentally unsustainable at the desired competitive level.
*   **Worse-than-Peer Cost Performance:** Despite Newmont's massive scale, its cost structure is significantly behind peers; its second quarter AISC was reported as nearly 25% higher than rival low-cost producer Agnico Eagle Mines. This contradicts the claim of being the safest and most leveraged investment, as higher costs lead to lower profit leverage on rising gold prices.
*   **Eroding Margins:** The high AISC levels mean that while record gold prices generate high revenue, the associated profit margins are being "eroded" by costs, which is the opposite of generating "extraordinary profits" from the current price environment.

### 2. Newcrest Integration and Capital Investment Risks

*   **Integration is a Cost Headwind, not a Tailwind:** The Newcrest acquisition, while structurally important, is cited by analysts and insiders as the *primary source* of Newmont's current cost challenges. The acquired assets, particularly Lihir and Cadia, are at a "difficult stage of their life-cycle" and require substantial ongoing sustaining capital expenditure to compensate for past under-investment by the previous owner.
*   **Projected Cost Increases on Key Expansions:** The assumption that key projects will reinforce the low-cost advantage is tenuous. The projected All-in Sustaining Cost for the pivotal Ahafo North project has been revised to **\$800–\$900 per ounce** for the first five years of production, a material increase from the initial estimate of **\$600–\$700 per ounce**. This upward cost creep immediately diminishes the project's profitability leverage.
*   **Project Delays and Execution Risk:** The Ahafo North project faced delays, with commercial production now planned for the fourth quarter of 2025, which is well past the initial construction completion target of the second half of 2023. The Cadia Panel Caves project's peak production is not expected until 2027. Delays and unexpected capital requirements risk tying up cash flow and further stress testing the balance sheet.

### 3. Management and Financial Execution Instability

*   **Unstable Senior Financial Leadership:** The bull case's mention of a "stable management transition" is immediately challenged by the recent departure of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the subsequent appointment of an interim CFO during the critical period of a massive integration, divestiture program, and deep cost-cutting mandate. This creates instability at the top financial level.
*   **High Debt and Buyback-Funded Returns:** While the asset sales have generated significant cash, the acquisition of Newcrest created a substantial debt load. The aggressive $6 billion share repurchase program, while boosting EPS, is partially funded by the proceeds from selling non-core assets which, by definition, reduces the future cash flow generation potential of the company's full portfolio. This strategy prioritizes a short-term stock boost over long-term reinvestment in a fully low-cost operation.
*   **Divestitures of Profitable Assets:** The "selling off all non-essential and high-cost mines" is a simplification. Some sold assets, like Akyem, were significant gold producers, which reduces the company’s near-term production profile and scale. The aggressive divestiture is a necessity to fund the Newcrest acquisition and reduce debt, not just a strategic move to optimize costs.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent, balanced, and deep dive into Newmont Corporation, clearly identifying the core conflict points between the Bull and Bear cases. The next steps must be focused on gathering the latest, most granular financial data to resolve these conflicts.

The initial web search provided some very relevant and recent (mid-2025) data points, but some key questions remain open or have conflicting answers.

## Next Steps and Unanswered Questions to Investigate

### 1. **Resolve the All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) Conflict**

The single most critical factor is proving or disproving the "low-cost producer" claim. While NEM's **2025 guidance is \$1,620/oz** for its core portfolio, this is significantly higher than a competitor like **Agnico Eagle, which is targeting \$1,250-\$1,300/oz**. The search also shows a Q2 2025 AISC of \$1,593/oz.

*   **Actionable Question:** What is the **actual AISC result for Q3 2025** and the **updated full-year 2025 guidance** (as Q3 earnings are expected on Oct 23, 2025)? How much of the planned **"Full Potential" cost savings** was actually realized in Q3, and is the company trending toward closing the cost gap with Agnico Eagle?

### 2. **Validate Newcrest Integration Synergies and Execution Risk**

The success of the Newcrest deal relies on achieving the promised synergies. The original target was **\$500 million in annual pre-tax synergies**. The Bear case suggests the integration is driving *higher costs*.

*   **Actionable Question:** Is Newmont on track to deliver the **\$500 million in annual synergies** on schedule, and what is the **updated total timeline** for realizing the full \$2 billion in cash improvements from divestitures and optimizations? Specifically, what are the *latest* estimates for sustaining capital required at **Cadia and Lihir** (the key Newcrest assets) for 2026?

### 3. **Verify Balance Sheet Health and Debt Reduction**

The balance sheet is a core risk. Q2 2025 Net Debt-to-EBITDA was low (e.g., 0.5x Debt-to-EBITDA), but this ratio fluctuates based on gold price, and the total debt load is still substantial (\$7.1B total debt as of Jun 2025).

*   **Actionable Question:** What are the **specific debt repayment milestones and targets** (in dollars) for the next 18 months, beyond the initial $1.4B retired? How much of the \$6 billion share repurchase program has been executed to date, and what is the **plan to fund the remaining portion**—is it from free cash flow, or the final proceeds of asset sales?

### 4. **Pinpoint CEO/CFO Instability and Long-Term Plan**

The CFO resigned in July 2025. This is a major headwind during a transition period.

*   **Actionable Question:** Has a **permanent Chief Financial Officer** been appointed since the July 2025 interim appointment of Peter Wexler? The incoming CEO, Natascha Viljoen, has a background in operations; what is her **publicly stated strategy** for cost *versus* growth for 2026 and beyond?

### 5. **Confirm Growth Project Costs and Timeline**

The bear case cited cost creep at the Ahafo North project. The latest guidance confirmed the All-in Sustaining Costs of **\$800 to \$900 per ounce** for the first five years, which is an increase from the initial estimate of \$600–\$700/oz. First gold pour occurred in September 2025, with commercial production expected Q4 2025.

*   **Actionable Question:** What is the **updated Capital Expenditure (CapEx) guidance** for the **Tanami Expansion 2** project and the **Cadia Panel Caves**? Are they on budget and on their current timeline to offset the higher-than-expected costs at Ahafo North?
