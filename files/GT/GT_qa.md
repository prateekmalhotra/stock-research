3.  **Uncertainty in EV Tire Market Penetration:** While EVs are a growth area, Goodyear may struggle to gain significant traction against established players and newer entrants specializing in EV-specific tire technology. The OE market is highly competitive, and the long-term replacement demand characteristics for EV tires are still developing.
4.  **Execution Hurdles and Integration Costs:** The ambitious "Goodyear Forward" plan and the integration of Cooper Tire face significant execution risks. Delays, unforeseen costs, and failure to achieve projected synergies could hinder profitability and distract management from core operational improvements.
5.  **Rising Raw Material and Energy Costs:** The tire manufacturing process is heavily reliant on raw materials like natural rubber, synthetic rubber, and petroleum-based chemicals, as well as energy. Fluctuations and increases in these costs, which are often volatile, can directly squeeze Goodyear's profit margins if they cannot be fully passed on to consumers.
6.  **Regulatory and Trade Policy Headwinds:** Increasingly stringent environmental regulations globally could necessitate significant investments in new technologies and materials, adding to costs. Furthermore, protectionist trade policies or geopolitical instability can disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of doing business internationally.
7.  **Cannibalization by Private Labels and Aftermarket:** Goodyear's brand strength may not be sufficient to prevent consumers from opting for lower-priced private label tires or other aftermarket alternatives, especially in price-sensitive segments, thereby limiting market share gains.
