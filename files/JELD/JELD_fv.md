## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

JELD-WEN is a global manufacturer of doors and windows, serving the highly cyclical new construction (NC) and repair & remodeling (R&R) sectors. The business engine is driven by:

1.  **Macro-cycle Recovery:** The current market (2025) is experiencing significant weakness with volume/mix declines due to high interest rates, leading to depressed new housing starts and cautious R&R spending. Management has significantly lowered 2025 guidance.
2.  **Internal Transformation:** Management is executing a transformation journey to improve operational efficiency, simplify the network (facility closures), and reduce costs. The goal is long-term success and positioning for a market recovery.

The projection is built on a **conservative recovery model** for the macro environment combined with modest benefits from the internal transformation.

| Year | Revenue (in millions USD) | Year-over-Year Growth Rate | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | **$3,485** | N/A | Calculated using the low-end of 2025 guidance (\$3.1B) and the core revenue decline guidance of 10% - 13% for 2025 (e.g., \$3.1B / (1 - 0.10) $\approx$ \$3.44B). Using a conservative starting point. |
| **2025 (Trough)** | **$3,100** | -11.0% | **Conservative Low-End of Management Guidance** (\$3.1B - \$3.2B). Reflects continued volume/mix decline and negative price/cost. |
| **2026 (Initial Recovery)** | **$3,350** | 8.1% | **Conservative recovery bounce-back.** Assumes the transformation gains traction and a modest rebound in R&R/NC as interest rates moderate. This is not a full return to 2024 levels, reflecting a conservative, slow recovery. |
| **2027 (Normalized Growth)** | **$3,550** | 6.0% | **Above-market growth** due to capturing transformation benefits (cost savings driving investment/share gain) and a more normalized macro environment for housing. |
| **2028** | **$3,728** | 5.0% | Steady growth, slightly above the estimated long-term growth of the building products market. |
| **2029** | **$3,877** | 4.0% | Continues normalized, modest growth. |
| **2030** | **$4,032** | 4.0% | Final year of explicit forecast, maintaining normalized growth. |

## 3. Margin Projections and Net Income (2025-2030)

Management's transformation is focused on realizing long-term margin improvement. Net Income (Loss) has been negative recently, which means the valuation must project a return to profitability based on the business engine assumptions.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Adj. EBITDA Guidance | EBITDA Margin | Net Income Margin (Conservative Estimate) | Net Income (B) (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)**| **$3,485** | N/A | N/A | -5.4% | **($187.6)** |
| **2025 (Trough)** | **$3,100** | $105 (Low End) | 3.39% | -1.5% | **($46.5)** |
| **2026** | **$3,350** | N/A | 5.00% | **0.5%** | **$16.8** |
| **2027** | **$3,550** | N/A | 6.50% | **2.0%** | **$71.0** |
| **2028** | **$3,728** | N/A | 7.50% | **3.0%** | **$111.8** |
| **2029** | **$3,877** | N/A | 8.00% | **3.5%** | **$135.7** |
| **2020** | **$4,032** | N/A | 8.50% | **4.0%** | **$161.3** |

***Justification for Net Income Margin (B) Projections:***
*   **2025:** Uses the highly conservative low-end of EBITDA guidance and assumes a continuation of negative net income, even after normalization for non-cash goodwill impairment.
*   **2026-2030:** Projects a slow, conservative recovery in Net Income Margin. The increase is driven by: **(1)** volume recovery (operating leverage), and **(2)** the full realization of cost savings from the multi-year transformation program (network optimization, headcount reduction). A 4.0% Net Income Margin is a very conservative estimate of normalized profitability for a cyclical manufacturing business post-turnaround.

## 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Adjusted Cash Flow

**Historical ROIC:** The company has reported a significant net loss in 2024 and is projected to have another loss in 2025.
*   **Invested Capital (2024):** Total Debt (\$1,192.0M) + Total Equity (\$620.1M) = \$1,812.1 million.
*   **ROIC (2024):** Net Loss / Invested Capital = (\$187.6M) / \$1,812.1M $\approx$ -10.3%.

Since the historical ROIC is negative, and profitability is projected for 2026 onwards, a **conservative but reasonable positive ROIC** must be assumed for new cash generation. I will use **5.0% ROIC**, which is below the expected long-term cost of capital and below what a healthy manufacturing company should earn, making it conservative.

**Cash Flow Projection:**
*   **Net Income for Next Year** = Net Income from That Year + ROIC * Net Income from Previous Year (carried over as cash).

| Year | Net Income (B) | Cash from Previous Net Income (C) | ROIC (5.0%) | Additional Income (D) = C * ROIC | Adjusted Net Income (B+D) = DCF Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | ($46.5) | N/A | N/A | N/A | **($46.5)** |
| **2026** | $16.8 | N/A | 5.0% | N/A | **$16.8** |
| **2027** | $71.0 | $16.8 | 5.0% | $0.8 | **$71.8** |
| **2028** | $111.8 | $71.8 | 5.0% | $3.6 | **$115.4** |
| **2029** | $135.7 | $115.4 | 5.0% | $5.8 | **$141.5** |
| **2030** | $161.3 | $141.5 | 5.0% | $7.1 | **$168.4** |

## 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**Assumptions:**

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **2.0%** (Slightly above long-term inflation, highly conservative for a business positioned for a turnaround and macro recovery).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** **10.0%** (A high rate, reflecting the company's current high leverage (net debt leverage of 7.4x as of Q3 2025) and the cyclical nature of the industry).

| Year (End of) | DCF Cash Flow (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | ($46.5) | 0.9091 | ($42.3) |
| **2026** | $16.8 | 0.8264 | $13.9 |
| **2027** | $71.8 | 0.7513 | $54.0 |
| **2028** | $115.4 | 0.6830 | $78.8 |
| **2029** | $141.5 | 0.6209 | $87.8 |
| **2030 (Terminal Year)**| $168.4 | 0.5645 | $95.1 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | $168.4 \* (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = **$2,149.9** | 0.5645 | **$1,213.9** |
| **Sum of NPVs (2025-2030) + TV NPV** | | | **$1,401.2** |

## 6. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Net Present Value of Cash Flows | **$1,401.2** |
| Add: Current Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | $150.3 |
| Subtract: Total Debt | ($1,192.0) |
| **Calculated Equity Value** | **$359.5** |
| Divide by: Shares Outstanding (84.85M) | / 84.85 |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$4.24** |

## 7. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$4.24** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **~$2.35** |
| **Difference** | **+80.4%** |

The calculated fair value of **$4.24** is significantly higher (over 80% higher) than the current market price of approximately **$2.35**.

### Justification for the Disparity

The substantial difference between the calculated fair value and the market price can be attributed to the following:

**Market Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

1.  **Imminent Debt Risk:** The market is likely pricing in a very high probability of a **near-term debt restructuring, dilution, or covenant breach**, given the high net debt leverage (7.4x as of Q3 2025), negative free cash flow, and the significant reduction in 2025 earnings guidance. The market's valuation implies a *much* lower expected Net Income than my conservative 4.0% terminal margin or an even higher discount rate/lower terminal growth rate.
2.  **Failure of Transformation:** The market may not believe management will successfully execute its turnaround plan (network optimization, cost reduction), leading to sustained low or negative margins well into the future. The deep operating losses and goodwill impairment charges in 2025 reinforce this pessimism.
3.  **Extended Housing Recession:** The market may assume the cyclical downturn in the housing and R&R market is more protracted than my conservative assumption of an initial rebound in 2026.

**My Conservative Assumptions (Optimistic by Comparison):**

1.  **Conservative but Positive Net Income:** My valuation is built on the core assumption that management's transformation efforts succeed in returning the company to a conservative, yet stable **4.0% Net Income Margin** by 2030. If the transformation fails and the company only manages a 1.0% Net Income Margin in 2030, the resulting fair value would drop dramatically.
2.  **Macro Recovery:** My model assumes the highly cyclical housing market begins a modest recovery in 2026. While conservative, this recovery is fundamental to realizing operating leverage and improving margins.
3.  **Low Terminal Growth:** The 2.0% terminal growth rate is appropriately conservative for a mature manufacturing business.

**Conclusion:**

My calculated fair value of **$4.24** suggests that the market is excessively pessimistic about JELD-WEN's ability to survive the current macro-economic slump and successfully execute its internal transformation. The market is pricing in either a **high risk of financial distress** (implying a required return significantly higher than my 10% discount rate or a much deeper net income loss than projected) or a **permanent impairment** of long-term profitability to a margin far below 4.0%. For the market price to be correct, the average Net Income projection for 2026-2030 would need to be near zero, or the discount rate would have to be substantially higher (e.g., 18-20%) to account for the current distress.

The difference represents the **Turnaround Premium/Risk:** The $1.89 difference (\$4.24 - \$2.35) is the expected value that will be realized *if* the management successfully navigates the debt burden, the macro-cycle turns, and the transformation yields an eventual 4.0% Net Income Margin.
