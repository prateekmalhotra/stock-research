## 1. Current Financial Data (as of Q2 2025 where available)

All financial data is sourced from JELD-WEN's SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) and earnings call transcripts.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source/Date | Calculation/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **$134.1** | Q2 2025 10-Q (June 28, 2025) | Unrestricted cash as per balance sheet. |
| **Total Debt** | **$1,180.5** | Q2 2025 10-Q (June 28, 2025) | Long-term Debt ($1,155.4M) + Current Maturities of Long-term Debt (implied, assuming minimal current debt beyond Long-term debt portion). Using a blended figure from Q1 2025 where Long-term debt was $1,157.1M and Current maturities was $25.1M (Total: $1,182.2M). Given the most recent Long-term debt is $1,155.4M, I will use **$1,180.5M** as the conservative estimate, using the Q1 current portion on the Q2 long-term figure. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **85.3** | Q1 2025 10-Q (March 29, 2025) [cite: 6 in step 2] | Most recent figure from SEC filing cover page (85,298,995). |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$4.77** | October 23-24, 2025 [cite: 3 in step 3] | Closing price around the current date of the valuation. |
| **2024 Net Revenues** | $3,775.6 | 2024 10-K [cite: 2 in step 2] | Historical starting point for projections. |
| **2024 Net Loss** | ($187.6) | 2024 10-K [cite: 2 in step 2] | Loss from continuing operations. |

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Forecast (2025-2030)

JELD-WEN's business engine is primarily driven by:
1.  **Macroeconomic Factors:** Residential new construction (New-Home) and Repair & Remodel (R&R) activity in North America and Europe, which are highly sensitive to interest rates and consumer confidence.
2.  **Internal Transformation Initiatives:** A multi-year strategy to simplify the business, improve manufacturing productivity, and reduce costs to offset volume/mix pressure.

Management commentary (Q4 2024, Q1/Q2 2025 transcripts) points to a significant volume/mix decline (-16% to -18% core volume in Q1 2025) and a weak macro-economic environment due to high interest rates, leading to a substantial drop in revenue and a collapse in Adjusted EBITDA margins (2.8% in Q1 2025). [cite: 1, 3, 7 in step 3] The company is focused on its transformation to drive productivity gains.

### Revenue Estimates

The forecast must be conservative, reflecting the challenging environment while cautiously assuming the benefits of the internal transformation and a gradual market recovery.

*   **2025 (Management Guidance/Conservative):**
    *   Management guided 2025 Revenue to **$3.2 - $3.4 billion** (down 4% to 9% Core Revenue vs. 2024). [cite: 6 in step 3]
    *   **Assumption (Conservative):** Use the low-end of the range: **$3,200 million**. (2024 Net Revenue of $3,775.6M less a conservative core decline plus divestiture impact).

*   **2026-2030 (Conservative Growth Model):**
    *   **2026:** Assume market bottom and slight stabilization. **2.0% growth** from 2025, driven by modest volume stabilization and early benefits of the transformation.
    *   **2027-2028:** Assume a modest cyclical recovery in the R&R and New-Home markets as interest rates normalize and the company's transformation efforts gain traction. **3.0% annual growth**.
    *   **2029-2030:** Assume long-term industry growth is lower, and the initial recovery benefit dissipates. Use a conservative **2.5% annual growth**.

| Year | Revenue (in millions USD) | Growth Rate | Justification (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **$3,200.0** | (15.2)% | Conservative estimate (low-end of management guidance). |
| **2026** | **$3,264.0** | 2.0% | Market bottom, minimal recovery, early productivity gains. |
| **2027** | **$3,361.9** | 3.0% | Modest cyclical recovery in housing/R&R and continued transformation benefit. |
| **2028** | **$3,462.8** | 3.0% | Continued modest cyclical recovery. |
| **2029** | **$3,549.4** | 2.5% | Step-down to long-term sustainable growth rate. |
| **2030** | **$3,638.1** | 2.5% | Stable, conservative long-term growth. |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Forecast

### Margin Assumptions

*   **Gross Margin (GM) and SG&A:** Historical Gross Margin in 2024 was 18.2%, with SG&A at 17.3% of revenue [cite: 2 in step 2]. The severe margin contraction in Q1 2025 (Adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.8%) [cite: 1 in step 3] shows the high operating leverage impact of volume decline.
*   **Net Income (NI) Margin:** JELD has been unprofitable in recent periods. We must project a path to modest profitability based on management's cost-saving focus. The model assumes a rapid improvement from 2025's expected loss as volume stabilizes and transformation benefits materialize.
*   **Operating Margin:** The key lever is the transformation program. As revenue stabilizes and grows, margin should expand. The goal is to reach a modest mid-single-digit operating margin by 2030.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Gross Margin % | Gross Profit (B) | SG&A % | SG&A Exp (C) | Other/Interest/Tax/Depreciation (D) | Net Income (Loss) Before ROIC | ROIC Net Income (E) | Final Net Income (F) = (B) - (C) - (D) + (E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $3,775.6 | 18.2% [cite: 2 in step 2] | $687.2 | 17.3% [cite: 2 in step 2] | $653.0 | $221.8 | ($187.6) | N/A | ($187.6) |
| **2025** | $3,200.0 | 18.5% | $592.0 | 18.0% | $576.0 | $200.0 | ($184.0) | N/A | ($184.0) |
| **2026** | $3,264.0 | 19.5% | $636.5 | 17.5% | $571.2 | $175.0 | ($9.7) | ($1.8) | ($11.5) |
| **2027** | $3,361.9 | 20.5% | $689.2 | 17.0% | $571.5 | $165.0 | ($47.3) | ($0.1) | ($47.4) |
| **2028** | $3,462.8 | 21.5% | $744.5 | 16.5% | $571.4 | $150.0 | $23.1 | ($0.5) | $22.6 |
| **2029** | $3,549.4 | 22.0% | $780.9 | 16.0% | $568.0 | $145.0 | $67.9 | $0.2 | $68.1 |
| **2030** | $3,638.1 | 22.5% | $818.6 | 15.5% | $563.9 | $140.0 | $114.7 | $0.7 | $115.4 |

**Assumptions for Margin Projections:**
*   **GM & SG&A:** Margins are conservatively assumed to recover slowly but steadily, driven by the transformation program. GM increases from a depressed 18.5% in 2025 to 22.5% in 2030 (still below industry peers), and SG&A drops from 18.0% of sales to 15.5% as fixed costs are leveraged.
*   **Other/Interest/Tax/Depreciation (D):** This includes all non-operating expenses. Given the company's high debt, interest expense is significant. This value is modeled as a decreasing absolute number reflecting reduced *non-cash* impairment charges, stabilizing D&A, and a modest reduction in interest expense due to the cash flow application outlined below. The losses in 2025-2027 are conservative given the $125M non-cash goodwill impairment in Q1 2025. [cite: 3 in step 3]
*   **Net Income ROIC Engine:**
    *   **Rule:** Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.
    *   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** We assume a conservative ROIC of **1.0%** on the accumulated cash from the prior year's net income. The historical ROIC has been negative due to recent losses, so we use a very conservative positive number to reflect the capital efficiency of an *improving* business without over-projecting returns.
    *   **ROIC Calculation:** *Prior Year Accumulated Net Income (Cash) x 1.0%*.
    *   **2025/2026 ROIC:** Since 2024 NI was negative, accumulated cash is a net loss, leading to a negative ROIC contribution until the company becomes profitable.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

The cash flow for this DCF is conservatively proxied by the **Final Net Income (F)**, as per the instruction that net income goes straight into cash. This is a conservative assumption as it excludes non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization from the cash flow calculation (i.e., it doesn't approximate Free Cash Flow to Equity), and includes all non-operating expenses, creating a very strict measure of profitability.

### **Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative but reasonable rate for a company in the cyclical building products sector with high leverage and recent operational volatility.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **2.0%**. This is a very conservative terminal growth rate, well below nominal GDP growth, reflecting the mature and cyclical nature of the doors and windows industry.

| Year | Final Net Income (F) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | ($184.0) | 0.909 | ($167.3) |
| **2026** | ($11.5) | 0.826 | ($9.5) |
| **2027** | ($47.4) | 0.751 | ($35.6) |
| **2028** | $22.6 | 0.683 | $15.4 |
| **2029** | $68.1 | 0.621 | $42.3 |
| **2030** | $115.4 | 0.564 | $65.1 |
| **NPV of Forecasted Cash Flow** | | | **($89.6)** |

### **Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) represents the value of all cash flows after the forecast period (2030), discounted back to 2030.

*   Terminal Year Cash Flow (2030) = $115.4 million
*   Perpetual Growth Rate (g) = 2.0%
*   Discount Rate (r) = 10.0%
*   Terminal Value (2030) = $\text{CF}_2030 \times \frac{(1+g)}{(r-g)}$
*   Terminal Value (2030) = $\$115.4 \times \frac{1.02}{(0.10 - 0.02)} = \$115.4 \times 12.75 = \$1,468.4$ million

### **NPV of Terminal Value**

*   NPV of TV = $\text{TV}_2030 \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
*   NPV of TV = $\$1,468.4 \times 0.564 = \$828.3$ million

### **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

*   $\text{TEV} = \text{NPV of Forecasted Cash Flow} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
*   $\text{TEV} = (\$89.6 \text{ million}) + \$828.3 \text{ million} = \$738.7$ million

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

### **Fair Value per Share**

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** \$738.7 million
*   **Less: Total Debt:** (\$1,180.5) million [cite: 6, 2 in step 3]
*   **Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents:** \$134.1 million [cite: 6 in step 3]
*   **Total Equity Value:** $\text{TEV} - \text{Total Debt} + \text{Total Cash} = \$738.7 - \$1,180.5 + \$134.1 = (\$307.7)$ million
*   **Fair Value per Share** = $\frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$
*   **Fair Value per Share** = $\frac{(\$307.7 \text{ million})}{85.3 \text{ million shares}} = (\$3.61)$

## Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **(\$3.61)** | N/A |
| **Current Stock Price** | N/A | **\$4.77** [cite: 3 in step 3] |

### Justification of Discrepancy

My fair value calculation yields a **negative equity value** and therefore a negative fair value per share of **(\$3.61)**, while the current market price is approximately **\$4.77** per share [cite: 3 in step 3]. This indicates a significant disconnect between my conservative DCF model and the market's current valuation.

**Why the Valuation is so different from the Market:**

1.  **Market is Pricing a Faster and Stronger Turnaround:** My model is highly conservative:
    *   It projects **three consecutive years of net losses (2025-2027)**, reflecting the severity of the Q1 2025 loss and the current macro-headwinds. The market is likely pricing a quicker transition to profitability based on the "transformation" narrative, perhaps expecting net positive income by 2026 or 2027.
    *   It only assumes an eventual **22.5% Gross Margin** and **15.5% SG&A-to-Revenue** by 2030. The market may expect margins to rebound to or exceed historical peaks sooner and faster, potentially valuing the stock on a multiple of expected 2026 or 2027 EBITDA that is substantially higher than my projected Net Income.
    *   My **conservative discount rate of 10.0%** and **maturity rate of 2.0%** anchor the Terminal Value firmly, while a more optimistic investor might use a lower discount rate or higher perpetual growth rate, which would drastically increase the NPV of the Terminal Value.

2.  **High Debt and Negative Cash Flow Drag:** The biggest drag on my DCF model is the company's **high debt load (\$1,180.5 million)** and the projected **three years of negative Net Income**. The Total Enterprise Value of \$738.7 million, even with a conservative growth model, is insufficient to cover the company's debt, leading to negative equity. The market is betting on the cash flow from the transformation to be materially higher than my net income projection, leading to:
    *   a much larger Terminal Value, and/or
    *   a rapid paydown of debt.

3.  **Net Income vs. FCFE:** My model uses **Net Income** as a proxy for cash flow. This is *extremely* conservative for a capital-intensive business because it ignores a significant benefit: **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**. Since D&A is a non-cash expense, Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) would be approximately: **Net Income + D&A - Capital Expenditures**. By only using Net Income, I am missing the true cash flow generation potential that the market sees, especially as CapEx normalizes.

**Conclusion:** The market is valuing JELD-WEN based on a successful execution of its cost-reduction and transformation initiatives, leading to a much higher **projected Free Cash Flow to Equity** and a swifter deleveraging timeline than implied by my very conservative, net-income-based DCF. The negative fair value is a direct result of the large debt load overshadowing the conservative long-term profitability projection.
