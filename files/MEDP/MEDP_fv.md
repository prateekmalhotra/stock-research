## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2026-2030)

The core business engine for a Contract Research Organization (CRO) like Medpace is its **backlog** and the **net book-to-bill ratio** (net new business awards divided by revenue).

**Business Engine Assumptions:**

*   **FY 2026 (Management Guidance):** The projection starts with management's official guidance, which is considered the most reliable near-term estimate.
    *   **Revenue:** Midpoint of $2.755B - $2.855B is **$2.805$ billion**, representing $10.9\%$ growth.
    *   **Net Income:** Midpoint of $487M - $511M is **$499$ million**.
*   **FY 2027 - 2030 (Conservative Projections):** The CEO noted that elevated cancellation rates in Q4 2025 were the "biggest sort of wild card," despite strong overall demand. This mandates a conservative, de-risked approach to growth.
    *   **Backlog Conversion:** Backlog conversion rate from 2025 was high, and the book-to-bill for 2025 was 1.05x.
    *   **Assumption:** We will assume the short-term volatility (cancellations) subsides, but Medpace's growth rate moderates from the recent double-digit expansion due to size and macroeconomic headwinds in biotech funding. A conservative growth rate will be applied:

| Year | Revenue (USD millions) | YoY Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | $2,530.2$ | 20.0% | Historical anchor |
| **2026 (Guidance Midpoint)** | **$2,805.0** | 10.9% | Management Guidance Midpoint |
| **2027** | **$3,000.0** | 6.95% | Conservative drop, representing sustained industry demand but moderation due to size and potential for continued volatility (cancellation rates) in the small-to-mid biotech market. |
| **2028** | **$3,180.0** | 6.00% | Further moderation toward long-term CRO industry growth rate. |
| **2029** | **$3,340.0** | 5.03% | Continued conservatism. |
| **2030** | **$3,485.0** | 4.34% | Approaching the Terminal Growth Rate, reflecting mature-stage growth for a specialized CRO. |

## 3. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections

### A. Margin Projections

Medpace's Net Income Margin for 2025 was $17.8\%$. The midpoint of the 2026 net income and revenue guidance also implies a margin of $17.8\%$ (499M / 2805M). We will assume a highly conservative and stable Net Income Margin for the projection period.

**Net Income Margin Assumption:** We will conservatively assume the margin remains flat at **17.5%** from 2027 onward, slightly below the 2025 and 2026 implied rate, to account for potential operational pressure, higher personnel costs, or unfavorable mix in reimbursable costs noted by management.

### B. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow)

The instruction states: Net income for the next year = (Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions) + (ROIC from Net Income got from previous year). For the base year net income, we use the management guidance for 2026, and the 17.5% margin for subsequent years.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation:**
The high historical ROIC figures reported by some sources (e.g., 354.33% in one snippet) are due to the company's minimal debt and low shareholder equity base, making a direct historical calculation unstable. Instead, a conservative, yet positive, ROIC of **15%** will be used, reflecting Medpace's specialization and operational efficiency, but in a conservative manner.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Base Net Income (B) = A * Margin | Prior Year Net Income (C) | ROIC (15%) * C (D) | Final Projected Net Income (B + D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2,530.2$ | 17.8% | $451.1$ | N/A | N/A | $451.1$ |
| **2026** | $2,805.0$ | 17.8% | **$499.0** | $451.1$ | $67.67$ | **$566.67** |
| **2027** | $3,000.0$ | 17.5% | **$525.0** | $566.67$ | $85.00$ | **$610.00** |
| **2028** | $3,180.0$ | 17.5% | **$556.5** | $610.00$ | $91.50$ | **$648.00** |
| **2029** | $3,340.0$ | 17.5% | **$584.5** | $648.00$ | $97.20$ | **$681.70** |
| **2030** | $3,485.0$ | 17.5% | **$609.9** | $681.70$ | $102.26$ | **$712.16** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Discount and Terminal Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative (higher) discount rate is essential for this valuation. Medpace's reported WACC is around 11.83%. We will assume a conservative and reasonable **12.0%** WACC to reflect the volatility in the biotech funding market and Medpace's concentrated customer base (Top 10 customers represent $35\%$ of revenue).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate, g):** A very conservative, low growth rate of **2.0%** will be used, representing long-term US inflation and a mature growth stage in the CRO industry.

### B. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value ($TV$) uses the last projected cash flow (2030 Net Income) and the constant growth perpetuity formula:

$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{\$712.16M \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.12 - 0.02}
$$

$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{\$726.40M}{0.10} = \mathbf{\$7,264.0 \text{ million}}
$$

### C. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The NPV is the present value of the cash flows from 2026-2030, plus the present value of the Terminal Value.

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (CF) (USD millions) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.12)^t) | NPV of CF (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (t=1)** | $566.67$ | 0.8929 | $505.06$ |
| **2027 (t=2)** | $610.00$ | 0.7972 | $486.39$ |
| **2028 (t=3)** | $648.00$ | 0.7118 | $460.10$ |
| **2029 (t=4)** | $681.70$ | 0.6355 | $433.15$ |
| **2030 (t=5)** | $712.16$ | 0.5674 | $404.14$ |
| **Terminal Value (t=5)** | $7,264.00$ | 0.5674 | $4,121.72$ |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **$6,410.56$ million** |

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value of Equity

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated by adding the NPV of future cash flows to the net cash position (Cash & Equivalents - Total Debt).

| Metric | Value (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $6,410.56$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $497.00$ |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $0.00$ |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$6,907.56$ million** |

### B. Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$6,907.56 \text{ million}}{29.2 \text{ million shares}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \mathbf{\$236.56}
$$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

**Fair Value Per Share: $236.56**

**Current Market Price: $428.03**

### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **$236.56** is significantly *lower* than the current market price of **$428.03**, suggesting the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about MEDP's future growth and/or profitability.

**Market's Implied Assumptions vs. Conservative Model:**

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate (g):** The market is likely pricing in a higher long-term growth rate than the conservative $2.0\%$ used here. Given Medpace's focus on specialized, high-growth, small-to-mid-sized biotech clients and their high book-to-bill ratio (1.05x in 2025), the market may be assuming a Terminal Growth Rate of **4.0% to 5.0%** to capture the specialized nature of the business.
2.  **Higher Near-Term Growth:** Our model uses an aggressive drop in growth from 10.9% (2026) to $6.95\%$ (2027) and then moderates to $4.34\%$ by 2030. The market is likely assuming that the company returns to and sustains **high double-digit growth (15-20%)** for a longer period (2027-2030), believing the current large backlog ($3.0$ billion) and net new business awards will power growth past the conservative estimates.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate (WACC):** The market may be using a lower WACC (e.g., $9-10\%$) than our conservative **$12.0\%$**. A lower rate reflects confidence in the company's strong cash generation and lack of debt, viewing it as a significantly less risky investment than the model assumes.

**Reconciling the Valuation:**

To bridge the gap between the Fair Value ($236.56) and the Market Price ($428.03), we can calculate the Terminal Growth Rate ($g$) the market is implicitly using, assuming a constant WACC of $12.0\%$ and the same Net Income projections:

$$\text{Implied Market Equity Value} = \text{Current Price} \times \text{Shares Outstanding} = \$428.03 \times 29.2M = \$12,498.48 \text{ million}$$

$$\text{Implied Market NPV} = \text{Implied Market Equity Value} - \text{Net Cash} = \$12,498.48M - \$497.0M = \$12,001.48 \text{ million}$$

The market is implicitly assigning a Total NPV of approximately **$12.0$ billion**. The difference between our model's NPV ($6.41$ billion) and the market's NPV ($12.0$ billion) is primarily driven by the long-term growth assumption. The market is highly confident that Medpace's strategic position allows for exceptional cash flow and superior, sustainable growth.

**Our conservative model is based on:**
*   A cautious approach to long-term growth, as mandated by the valuation rules, especially in the volatile CRO/biotech sector.
*   The management's own caution about "elevated cancellations" and the business being a "wild card."
*   A conservative ROIC and Discount Rate.

The market is pricing MEDP as a **premium growth stock** in a specialized, high-demand industry segment, with high certainty that the historical growth will continue. Our valuation, while strictly adhering to conservative and management-guided metrics, fails to capture the market's belief in MEDP's long-term competitive moat and superior reinvestment returns.

## **Final Valuation**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **$236.56** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$428.03** |
| **Justification** | The market is valuing MEDP as a high-growth specialty CRO with a significantly higher long-term growth rate ($g > 4\%$) and/or a lower discount rate ($WACC < 10\%$) than used in this conservative DCF model. |
