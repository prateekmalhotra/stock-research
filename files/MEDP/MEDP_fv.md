### **Step 2: Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

Medpace's business engine is a "full-service CRO" model primarily focused on **small- to mid-sized biotech companies** (approx. 90% of clients). The revenue model is driven by converting a growing backlog into revenue.

**Justification for Revenue Growth Assumptions:**

1.  **Near-Term (2025):** The 2025 revenue is based on management's official guidance of \$2.48B - \$2.53B (midpoint **\$2.505B**), representing 17.6% to 20.0% growth over the 2024 revenue of \$2.11B. This is considered truth, as per the rules.
2.  **Key Driver: Net Book-to-Bill & Backlog Conversion:** The Q3 2025 Net Book-to-Bill ratio was a very strong **1.20**, and backlog conversion improved to 23.0%. A book-to-bill ratio > 1.0 ensures future growth. This performance is fueled by a strategic "therapeutic mix shift to **faster burning studies**" (e.g., metabolic studies) that convert backlog to revenue more quickly.
3.  **Conservative Long-Term Deceleration:**
    *   **2026:** Soft guidance from the Q3 2025 call suggested **low double-digit revenue growth**. I will use a conservative **11.0%** growth rate, slightly above the low-end, reflecting the strong Q3 2025 book-to-bill.
    *   **2027-2030:** Growth must decelerate as the company scales. The projection assumes annual growth rates slowly decline toward the assumed long-term maturity rate. This is conservative, despite the company's relatively small share of its total addressable market (~$29B).

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate (Conservative Assumption) | Projected Revenue (in millions USD) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 18.7% | \$2,505.0 | Management Guidance Midpoint |
| **2026** | 11.0% | \$2,780.6 | Conservative estimate based on "low double-digit" soft guidance |
| **2027** | 9.0% | \$3,030.9 | Deceleration, maintaining strong market position |
| **2028** | 7.0% | \$3,243.1 | Further market saturation/deceleration |
| **2029** | 5.0% | \$3,405.3 | Approaching industry average growth |
| **2030** | 4.0% | \$3,541.5 | Approaching terminal growth rate |

### **Step 3: Margin and ROIC Projections**

**Justification for Margin and ROIC Assumptions:**

1.  **Net Income Margin:** The full-year 2024 Net Income Margin was 19.16%. The 2025 guidance implies 17.36%. To maintain a **conservative** approach, I will use a fixed **17.0%** Net Income Margin from 2026 onward, reflecting potential operational cost inflation or competitive pricing pressures.
2.  **ROIC:** Medpace's historical ROIC has been exceptionally high, with a 5-year average of 30.2% and a TTM as high as 66.3%. This indicates a highly capital-efficient business. However, for a **conservative** model, I will use a modest **10.0% ROIC** on the prior year's accumulated Net Income (cash) to model the returns generated from internal reinvestment.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (Millions USD) | Prior Year Net Income (Accum. Cash) (Millions USD) | ROIC (10.0%) from Accum. Cash (Millions USD) | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income + ROIC Income) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$2,505.0 | 17.36% | **\$435.0** | - | - | \$435.0 |
| **2026** | \$2,780.6 | 17.0% | \$472.7 | \$435.0 | \$43.5 | **\$516.2** |
| **2027** | \$3,030.9 | 17.0% | \$515.2 | \$435.0 + \$516.2 = \$951.2 | \$95.1 | **\$610.3** |
| **2028** | \$3,243.1 | 17.0% | \$551.3 | \$951.2 + \$610.3 = \$1,561.5 | \$156.2 | **\$707.5** |
| **2029** | \$3,405.3 | 17.0% | \$578.9 | \$1,561.5 + \$707.5 = \$2,269.0 | \$226.9 | **\$805.8** |
| **2030** | \$3,541.5 | 17.0% | \$602.0 | \$2,269.0 + \$805.8 = \$3,074.8 | \$307.5 | **\$909.5** |

### **Step 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%**. A conservative and reasonable cost of capital for a high-growth, established CRO.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. A very conservative rate, slightly above the long-term US inflation target, assuming stable, moderate growth beyond 2030.

#### **I. Net Present Value (NPV) of Explicit Forecast Period (2025-2030)**

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 10.0%)^n) | Net Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$435.0 | 0.909 | \$395.4 |
| **2026** | \$516.2 | 0.826 | \$426.4 |
| **2027** | \$610.3 | 0.751 | \$458.3 |
| **2028** | \$707.5 | 0.683 | \$483.2 |
| **2029** | \$805.8 | 0.621 | \$500.6 |
| **2030** | \$909.5 | 0.564 | \$512.8 |
| **NPV of Explicit Forecast Period** | | | **\$2,776.7** |

#### **II. Terminal Value (TV)**

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030. We use the Gordon Growth Model based on the 2030 projected cash flow:

*   **Terminal Value (2030)** = [2030 Cash Flow \* (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
*   TV (2030) = [\$909.5M \* (1 + 0.025)] / (0.10 - 0.025)
*   TV (2030) = \$932.2M / 0.075 = **\$12,429.3 Million**

#### **III. Net Present Value of Terminal Value**

*   **NPV of TV** = Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^n
*   NPV of TV = \$12,429.3M / (1 + 0.10)^6
*   NPV of TV = \$12,429.3M \* 0.564 = **\$7,006.1 Million**

#### **IV. Total Enterprise Value (EV) & Equity Value**

*   **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** = NPV of Explicit Forecast Period + NPV of Terminal Value
*   EV = \$2,776.7 million + \$7,006.1 million = **\$9,782.8 Million**
*   **Total Equity Value** = EV + Total Cash - Total Debt
*   Total Equity Value = \$9,782.8 million + \$285.4 million - \$0.0 million = **\$10,068.2 Million**

### **Step 5: Fair Value Per Share and Conclusion**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (Calculated)** | \$10,068.2 Million |
| **Shares Outstanding (Basic)** | 28.168 Million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | \$10,068.2M / 28.168M = **\$357.43** |
| **Current Market Price (MEDP)** | **\$605.20** |

**Fair Value Conclusion:** The calculated **Fair Value is \$357.43 per share.**

---

### **Step 6: Justification for Market Discrepancy**

The calculated fair value of **\$357.43** is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$605.20**. This massive difference of over 69% suggests the market is making much more aggressive assumptions about Medpace's future growth and profitability than the conservative model employed here.

**Why is the Market's Assumption so Different from the Conservative Model?**

The market is likely betting on the continuation of exceptional, near-historical growth rates for a much longer period, driven by the unique dynamics of Medpace's focus on small- and mid-sized biotechs.

| Conservative Model Assumption | Market's Likely Implied Assumption | Justification for Market's View |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** slows sharply from 18.7% (2025) to **4.0%** by 2030. | Revenue Growth remains in the **mid-teens (14-16%)** for the next 5+ years. | The strong **1.20 Net Book-to-Bill** and the "faster burning studies" mix shift is seen as sustainable, allowing them to rapidly convert new awards and grow faster than the overall CRO industry for an extended period. |
| **Net Income Margin** is fixed conservatively at **17.0%**. | Net Income Margin will return to and sustain the **20%+** range. | Medpace's full-year 2024 Net Income Margin was 19.16%. The market believes operational leverage will increase, driving margins past the conservative 2025 guidance of 17.36%. |
| **ROIC** is a conservative **10.0%**. | The true reinvestment return is closer to the historical **30% - 66%** TTM figures. | The market recognizes MEDP as an *ultra-efficient* capital allocator, and its high returns on capital (ROIC > WACC) mean future growth adds significantly more value than assumed by the 10% rate. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC) is 10.0%**. | The market's required return (WACC) is lower, perhaps **8.0% - 9.0%**. | A lower WACC (e.g., 8.0%) would significantly increase the NPV of both the explicit and terminal periods. |

**Conclusion:**

The market is assigning a valuation of approximately \$17.03 Billion (\$605.20 \* 28.168M shares), which is **\$6.96 Billion** higher than the model's derived Equity Value. This premium is Medpace's "growth option."

The conservative nature of this DCF assumes that the current exceptional operational performance (high book-to-bill, high ROIC, fast backlog conversion) will fade quickly. The market is extrapolating that exceptional performance for much longer, which is a key risk factor for the current stock price. The valuation gap suggests the market has a high confidence in Medpace's **sustainable competitive advantage** and ability to execute its "high-science and disciplined operating approach".
