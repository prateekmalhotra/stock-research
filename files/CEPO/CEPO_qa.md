## Business Summary

Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. operates as a real estate investment company focused on acquiring, managing, and owning income-producing commercial properties, primarily in the United States. The company's core business model involves raising capital from individual and institutional investors to purchase assets such as office buildings, industrial facilities, and retail centers. CEPO generates its revenue predominantly through the collection of rental income from its tenants, which are typically established businesses occupying the properties under long-term leases. The company aims to provide returns to its own investors through this steady rental income and through potential profits when the underlying properties are eventually sold.

---

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk is tenant risk, where key businesses occupying CEPO’s properties might fail or vacate early, leading to a sudden loss of rental income. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of borrowing money for new purchases or refinancing existing debt, which immediately harms current earnings. A major long-term risk is the cyclical nature of the commercial real estate market; during economic recessions, property values can drop significantly, making it difficult to sell properties at a profit. Historically, severe downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis, illustrate how quickly liquidity can dry up and asset values can decline, directly impacting the ability to generate returns for investors. This concern is particularly relevant now as shifts toward remote work could permanently decrease the demand for office space, jeopardizing CEPO's long-term profitability and market position.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO), a company that took a specific path in the financial world.

### History of Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO)

1.  **Inception and Founding Purpose (2020):** Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. was officially formed in November 2020. It was established as a **Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)**, which is commonly known as a "blank check company." This means the company was created to raise money from investors and then, later on, use that money to buy or merge with an existing private business, thus bringing the private company public.

2.  **The Core Goal of the Business:** The entire purpose of CEPO's founding was to quickly find a suitable private company to merge with, a process called the "initial business combination." The leaders aimed to focus their search on companies in sectors where they had a lot of expertise, such as financial services, healthcare, real estate, technology, and software.

3.  **A Powerful Tailwind (The Sponsor):** A huge advantage (a *tailwind*) for CEPO was its backing by an affiliate of **Cantor Fitzgerald**, a well-known, large, and experienced global financial services firm. This backing gave the company significant credibility and access to a vast network of industry contacts, making it easier to find a strong acquisition target compared to a SPAC with no established sponsor.

4.  **Going Public and Raising Capital (2025):** The company officially launched its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in January 2025, raising \$200 million from investors by selling its shares on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker CEPO. This money was placed into a secure trust account and would be used only to fund the eventual merger or returned to shareholders if no deal was found.

5.  **The Inherent Headwind (The Clock and the Search):** As a SPAC, the main *headwind* (challenge) is the tight deadline, typically two years, to complete the merger. If they fail to find and complete a deal in time, the company must liquidate, and the investors get their money back, but the opportunity is lost for the management team. This puts immense pressure on the management to find the perfect match.

6.  **An Early Financial Problem (Pre-Deal Status):** Before a SPAC completes a merger, it has no actual business operations, which means its financial health can look complicated. For instance, CEPO was reported to have a negative financial standing in its shareholder equity, which, while a serious indicator for an operating company, is a typical, albeit challenging, reality for a pre-merger blank check company.

7.  **The Innovative Solution and Present Day (The BSTR Merger):** In a significant move in July 2025, CEPO announced it had found its target and entered into a definitive agreement to merge with **BSTR Holdings Inc.**, also known as the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company. This merger, if completed, represents the successful outcome of the company's blank-check mission and a strategic entry into the rapidly growing digital asset space.

8.  **The New Goal and Future:** The merger with BSTR is a major strategic pivot, capitalizing on the *tailwind* of growing institutional and public interest in Bitcoin and digital assets. Upon closing, the combined entity is expected to trade under the new ticker symbol "BSTR." CEPO's initial life as a shell company will end, and it will transform into an operating company focused on holding a large treasury of Bitcoin.

## Moat Analysis

Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) is a **Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)**, which is a "blank check" company created solely to raise capital through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and then use those funds to acquire or merge with an existing private company. Therefore, its "moat" is not based on traditional products or customer sales, but on its ability to successfully source and close a profitable acquisition (a "Business Combination").

### Analysis of the Moat for Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO)

#### **1. Core Moat: The Financial Sponsor's Network and Reputation**

*   **Affiliation with Cantor Fitzgerald:** The primary competitive advantage is its sponsorship by and affiliation with Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., a major global financial services firm. This relationship provides credibility, significant capital market expertise, and an extensive global network.
*   **Proprietary Deal Flow:** The parent company's vast network acts as a powerful source for finding and evaluating potential private companies for acquisition, giving CEPO access to deal opportunities that might not be available to other blank-check companies.
*   **Management Team Expertise:** The management team and affiliates bring deep experience in the target sectors (financial services, healthcare, technology), which is attractive to potential target companies seeking strategic guidance, not just capital.

#### **2. Differentiation and Special Market Position**

*   **Financial Service Niche Focus:** While the search is broad, CEPO focuses on areas where the sponsor has core expertise, such as financial services, real estate services, technology, and software, allowing it to differentiate itself by offering targeted, specialized support.
*   **Pricing Power is Transactional:** As a SPAC, it does not have traditional product pricing power. Its "special position" is its ability to negotiate favorable deal terms with a target company, often because the target values the public listing and the support of the established Cantor name.
*   **Reason for "Growth" (Fundraising):** The reason it successfully raised capital (the "growth") is entirely due to the reputation and successful track record of the Cantor Fitzgerald brand and its leaders, which gives investors confidence that a high-quality acquisition will eventually be made.

#### **3. Vulnerability and Customer Stickiness**

*   **High Risk of Displacement by Capital:** The SPAC market is highly competitive, and CEPO faces direct competition from many other SPACs and private equity entities. A competitor with more capital can easily outbid CEPO for a desirable target company.
*   **Customers/Contracts are One-Time:** CEPO's core "contract" is the one-time business combination agreement with a private company. It does not have recurring customer contracts in its current form. However, the company is looking to acquire a target business that ideally has **recurring revenue** streams to ensure long-term value post-merger.

#### **4. Efforts to Create a Moat and Network Effects**

*   **Leveraging Network Effects in Deal-Making:** The company's strongest "network effect" is an internal one, coming from the continuous deal flow and relationship-building of the parent company, Cantor Fitzgerald. Every successful deal strengthens the firm's reputation, making future deal-sourcing easier.
*   **No Traditional R&D or Innovation:** There is no investment in traditional research and development (R&D) or a need for product innovation. The "innovation" is in the financial structure and the ability to identify an undervalued or high-growth private company that can benefit from going public.
*   **Future Moat (Post-Acquisition):** The ultimate goal is to complete a merger with a company that *itself* has a strong, sustainable moat, such as the recently announced target, BSTR Holdings, a Bitcoin treasury and capital markets platform. This strategic choice is how CEPO aims to create a solid moat for the combined, long-term operating entity.

## Catalyst Analysis

Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), meaning it was formed specifically to merge with an existing private company to take it public. The company has already identified and announced its target, the **Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (BSTR Holdings, Inc.)**.

Therefore, the catalysts for CEPO's stock price are tied to the successful completion of this merger and the future performance of the combined entity, which will trade under the new ticker symbol **"BSTR."**

## Catalysts for Near-Term and Long-Term Stock Price Increase

### Near-Term Catalysts (The Merger Process)

1.  **Successful Closing of the Business Combination:** The primary near-term catalyst is the formal completion of the merger with Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (BSTR), which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. Stock prices of SPACs often increase when the deal closes and the combined company begins trading.
2.  **Shareholder Approval and Final SEC Filing:** The stock price is likely to react to key milestones like the filing of the definitive proxy statement and securing the required CEPO shareholder vote to approve the business combination.
3.  **Positive Momentum in PIPE Financing:** The merger includes up to **$1.5 billion** in Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) financing, which is a record amount for a Bitcoin treasury SPAC merger. The final, confirmed commitments of this large financing package will reinforce investor confidence in the new company's capital strength.

### Long-Term Catalysts (The Combined Company: BSTR)

4.  **Growth of the Bitcoin Treasury:** The combined company, BSTR, is launching with a substantial treasury of **30,021 Bitcoin**, which would position it as the fourth-largest publicly listed corporate Bitcoin treasury globally. As a **"pure-play bitcoin treasury firm,"** the stock price will be heavily correlated with the price of Bitcoin.
5.  **Acquisition of Additional Bitcoin and New Products:** The net proceeds from the merger will be used to acquire more Bitcoin and to build a suite of Bitcoin-native capital-markets products and advisory services. Success in expanding the Bitcoin holdings and launching profitable new products will drive long-term value.
6.  **Strong Management and Institutional Support:** BSTR will be led by CEO Dr. Adam Back (inventor of Hashcash, which influenced Bitcoin's proof-of-work) and CIO Sean Bill (experienced in institutional digital asset investment). The partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial firm, indicates strong institutional backing and expertise.

***

### Management Strategy and Commentary

*   **Explicit Strategy (Management's Mandate):** The core strategy of the combined entity, as stated by management, is to be a **Bitcoin-native capital markets platform** with a mandate to **accumulate Bitcoin, generate in-kind Bitcoin yield, and advise corporates and sovereigns on Bitcoin-based treasury strategies.**
*   **Vision on Integration:** Brandon Lutnick, CEO of CEPO and Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, said the transaction "marks another step towards the integration of the Bitcoin economy and traditional finance," highlighting the firm's focus on bridging these two markets.
*   **Focus on Measurement:** CEO Dr. Adam Back's strategy for the new company is centered on "measuring success in **Bitcoin per share**," indicating a focus on maximizing the underlying value of its primary asset for shareholders.

## Management Record

The analysis of Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) management, its track record, and future strategy is particularly relevant for investors, given its nature as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) and its announced merger.

### Management Team (Brandon Lutnick & Jane Novak)

1.  **Current Leadership:** The sponsor team is led by **Brandon Lutnick** as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and **Jane Novak** as Chief Financial Officer. Both executives are affiliates of the well-established financial services firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.
2.  **CEO Background and Experience:** Brandon Lutnick is a young executive (age 27) with a short professional track record, having graduated from Stanford in May 2021. His prior roles included working as a credit analyst at Oak Hill Advisors and in equity sales and trading at an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. before moving into executive roles in late 2024.
3.  **Extensive Affiliation:** Mr. Lutnick's leadership position extends across multiple Cantor Fitzgerald SPACs, serving as CEO and Chairman for Cantor Equity Partners I, II, III, IV, and V. This demonstrates a central role in Cantor's SPAC strategy.
4.  **CFO Expertise:** Jane Novak, the CFO, is also the Global Head of Accounting Policy at Cantor, suggesting a focus on financial control and compliance, leveraging the expertise of the broader Cantor Fitzgerald group.

### History and Previous Management Change

5.  **Previous CEO:** The former Chairman and CEO was **Howard W. Lutnick** (Brandon's father), a prominent and resilient figure in the financial services industry, known for his long tenure at Cantor Fitzgerald.
6.  **Reason for Change:** Howard W. Lutnick resigned from his role at CEPO effective December 26, 2024, to accept a nomination to serve as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, a management change unrelated to any company dispute or disagreement.
7.  **Founding/Structure:** CEPO launched its $200 million Initial Public Offering (IPO) in January 2025, operating as a "blank check company" (SPAC) to seek a business combination. The company initially set a generalist target focus across financial services, healthcare, real estate, technology, and software.

### Key Decisions, Future Strategy, and Value Delivery

8.  **Key Decision (Merger):** CEPO successfully delivered on its promise to find an acquisition target by entering a definitive business combination agreement on July 16, 2025, with **BSTR Holdings, Inc.**
9.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** The transaction re-orients the company's future focus, as BSTR Holdings is a **Bitcoin treasury and capital markets platform**. The combined entity will trade under the ticker "BSTR" and plans to use the proceeds to acquire more Bitcoin and develop Bitcoin-native financial products.
10. **Delivery on Promises/Track Record:** The management team successfully completed the IPO at the standard $10.00 per share and secured a merger target within months, fulfilling the SPAC's primary objective. The stock price performance since the IPO shows an overall increase of approximately 6%, although it experienced a temporary drop of nearly 9% following the merger announcement.
11. **Affiliate Track Record (Mixed):** While CEPO and a related SPAC (CEP) that also announced a Bitcoin merger are noted as having positive returns (+6% and +172% respectively), other recent Cantor-backed SPACs (CF Acquisition VIII and VI) have delivered poor shareholder value, showing significant declines from their offer prices.
12. **Value Proposition:** The core value delivery to date has been the successful IPO and the preservation of the initial $10.00 share value in the trust account, followed by the acquisition of a target in a high-growth sector (digital assets) that provides a pathway for long-term growth. Investors are explicitly advised not to rely on the historical performance of the broader Cantor management team as an indication of CEPO's future performance.

## Management Incentive

Based on the nature of Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), its management's incentives are structured primarily around the successful completion of an initial business combination (the "de-SPAC" process).

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO)**

#### **I. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **High Insider Ownership:** The Sponsor, Cantor EP Holdings I, LLC (which is affiliated with Cantor Fitzgerald and led by CEO Howard W. Lutnick), beneficially owns a significant block of the company’s stock. This includes 500,000 Class A and 5,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing approximately **21.6%** of the total outstanding ordinary shares.
2.  **Conversion-Contingent Equity (Founder Shares):** The core of the insider holding is the 5,000,000 Class B shares (Founder Shares), which convert to publicly tradable Class A shares only upon the *successful completion* of the initial business combination. The high percentage of ownership (higher the better) provides a substantial long-term incentive for management, as their wealth is tied to the post-merger equity value.
3.  **Incentive to Close a Deal:** Since the Founder Shares were typically acquired at a nominal price, they are essentially worthless if the company fails to complete an acquisition and liquidates the trust account. This structure powerfully incentivizes the management team to find and close a transaction within the required timeline.

#### **II. Compensation Structure**

1.  **Minimal Cash Compensation (Pre-Merger):** As a SPAC that has not yet completed a merger, the management's cash compensation is typically minimal, often covering only general and administrative costs and related-party administrative expenses.
2.  **Equity-Focused Structure:** The vast majority of the management's financial reward is in the form of the aforementioned Class B ordinary shares. This is an all-or-nothing incentive, meaning management is incentivized to ensure the initial business combination is not only completed but also creates a valuable public company.
3.  **Lack of Traditional Performance Metrics (Pre-Merger):** Prior to the business combination, the management does not have a traditional compensation structure (e.g., annual salary, cash bonuses) tied to operating company metrics like revenue or profit, as the company is a shell with no commercial operations.

#### **III. Conclusion on Incentives**

1.  **Strong Alignment with Shareholder Interests (Completion):** The structure is designed to **strongly incentivize** management to act in the interest of shareholders by finding a suitable target and completing a merger. If the management fails to complete a deal, they lose the significant value of their founder shares, while public shareholders receive their IPO investment back with interest.
2.  **Potential for Misaligned Incentive (Deal Quality):** The *primary* incentive is to *close a deal* before the deadline, which could potentially pressure management to pursue a lower-quality target just to monetize their Founder Shares. This risk is inherent in the SPAC model, though the long-term value of their 20%+ stake also pressures them to seek a good target.
3.  **Overall Conclusion:** The management's incentive model is highly **equity-aligned** with shareholders, as the value of their substantial ownership stake depends entirely on the company completing a transaction and the stock performing well afterward.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of the price history and technical indicators for Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), here is a summary.

### **CEPO Price History & Analysis**

1.  **Current Price vs. 52-Week Low:** Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) is currently trading very close to its 52-week low. Using the approximate last closing price of **$10.50** and a 52-week low of **$10.04**, the stock is approximately **4.58%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **52-Week Range Context (SPAC Floor):** The stock's 52-week low of $10.04 and its current price near $10.50 is typical for a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), which generally trades around the $10.00 IPO price, representing the cash value held in its trust account.

3.  **Analysis on Trading Low (Technical Analysis):** The technical analysis for CEPO presents mixed signals, indicating it is **not definitively trading low** in an oversold technical sense, though its price is near the floor. While some Moving Averages show a "Strong Buy" outlook, other indicators lead to a "Neutral" or even a "Sell" signal from other sources for short-term and one-month views.

4.  **Significant Price Volatility (Big Drop):** The stock experienced a major gain and subsequent drop over the last year, with a 52-week high of **$16.50** before falling back to the current price range. This dramatic volatility is characteristic of a SPAC's life cycle.

5.  **Reason for the Drop/Volatility (SPAC Merger News):** The "big gain" to $16.50 and subsequent "big drop" was likely driven by news of its potential business combination. In July 2025, CEPO announced a merger with **BSTR Holdings**, a Bitcoin treasury and capital markets platform, which caused the stock to jump (the *gain*), as is common for SPACs announcing deals. The subsequent drop from the high to near the $10.00 floor suggests a fading of investor enthusiasm for the deal or market skepticism typical in the De-SPAC process, bringing the price back toward the trust value.

***Note:** CEPO is a blank check company (SPAC), meaning it has no commercial operations and was formed solely to merge with another business. Its price action is therefore driven heavily by merger announcements and deadlines.

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO) relies entirely on its successful transformation into a major publicly traded Bitcoin company, which will be renamed BSTR. In the near term, the stock price should see a significant jump once the merger formally closes in late 2025, moving the price permanently above the cash value floor. This event transitions the company from an empty shell into an operating business positioned in a high-growth sector. Long term, the company’s value is directly tied to the rising price of Bitcoin. BSTR is launching with a large treasury of over 30,000 Bitcoin, meaning any increase in Bitcoin's price will automatically boost the company’s net worth. Furthermore, the company plans to use its substantial capital and the institutional credibility of the Cantor Fitzgerald backing to build a profitable business: it will acquire more Bitcoin, generate income from its existing holdings, and offer crucial Bitcoin financial advice to other large corporations and governments, creating a powerful, dual-engine growth model.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions for this bull case are: 1) The business combination (merger) with BSTR Holdings, Inc. successfully closes as planned in late 2025 without major delays or shareholder redemption issues. 2) The price of Bitcoin must experience significant long-term appreciation, as the company’s core asset and performance metric is measured in 'Bitcoin per share.' If the Bitcoin price stagnates or falls, the stock will struggle. 3) The management team must successfully execute its strategy of efficiently accumulating additional Bitcoin with the proceeds from the merger and must successfully launch profitable, high-demand Bitcoin-native financial products and advisory services.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for Cantor Equity Partners I, Inc. (CEPO)/BSTR contains several critical flaws and risks that form the basis of a strong bear case, particularly concerning its valuation, business model execution, and the structure of the SPAC merger.

### Bear Case Thesis: Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **The "Dual-Engine Growth Model" is Unproven and Overly Ambitious:** The long thesis assumes the new company can successfully execute a *two-part* strategy: a Bitcoin treasury and a profitable Bitcoin financial advisory business. However, the CEO, Dr. Adam Back, is a renowned cryptographer and co-founder of Blockstream, whose background is in blockchain infrastructure and technology, not in running a regulated, high-volume capital markets or institutional financial advisory firm for large corporations and governments. The ability to successfully launch this highly competitive and specialized secondary business is therefore a significant execution risk.

2.  **Valuation Risk from Treasury Saturation and Lack of Premium:** While the bull case touts a large treasury (over 30,000 Bitcoin), this only positions BSTR as the *fourth-largest* publicly listed corporate Bitcoin treasury, substantially behind the market leader (Strategy/MicroStrategy). As the market for Bitcoin treasury stocks matures, many companies in this sector are increasingly trading at or below the net asset value of their Bitcoin holdings, making the promised stock price premium over the "cash value floor" unlikely and subjecting BSTR to pure commodity-price volatility.

3.  **Significant Cash Reduction Risk from SPAC Redemptions:** The thesis relies on the merger closing "without major delays or shareholder redemption issues" to secure "substantial capital" for growth. As a SPAC, CEPO is exposed to high redemption rates, where current shareholders can choose to redeem their shares for the IPO price (the $10 cash floor). High redemptions would severely reduce the net cash proceeds available to BSTR to acquire *additional* Bitcoin or fund the expensive launch of the proposed capital-markets products and advisory services.

4.  **Institutional Credibility is an Association, Not a Guarantee of Business Success:** The bull case relies on the "institutional credibility of the Cantor Fitzgerald backing." While the SPAC sponsor is affiliated with Cantor Fitzgerald, that credibility does not translate into BSTR automatically capturing market share in institutional Bitcoin financial services, which is already fiercely contested by established firms and crypto-native asset managers. The new company still has to build its own profitable revenue streams in a volatile and competitive industry.

5.  **Direct Investment in Bitcoin or ETFs is a Less Risky Alternative:** The core value driver of BSTR is the rising price of Bitcoin. With the proliferation of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which offer liquid, regulated, and low-fee exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, BSTR's value proposition is diluted. The stock carries the operational, execution, and SPAC structure risk associated with BSTR's unproven second business model, all while its returns are still largely dictated by the price of its core asset, making direct exposure to Bitcoin or an ETF a simpler and less risky investment.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your extensive analysis and the current state of the CEPO/BSTR merger, the following steps are the most critical to investigate. These steps target the core financial uncertainty of the SPAC structure and the main execution risk of the combined company's "dual-engine" business model, which are the two largest points of contention between your Long and Bear theses.

### **Important Questions Still Left Unanswered**

#### **1. Quantify the SPAC Redemption Risk (The Financial Unknown)**

*   **Question:** What are the *current* expected net cash proceeds from the CEPO trust account, and what is the maximum or estimated shareholder redemption rate?
*   **Investigation:** Search the SEC EDGAR database for the most recent **Amendment to the Form S-4 Registration Statement (S-4/A)** or the **Preliminary Proxy Statement (PREM14A)** for CEPO/BSTR. This document should contain the latest financial tables that detail the minimum and maximum cash scenarios based on estimated shareholder redemptions.
*   **Why it matters:** The bear case hinges on "High redemptions... would severely reduce the net cash proceeds." Quantifying this risk (e.g., if redemptions are projected at 90%, only \$20 million of the \$200 million trust remains) is essential for calculating the final available capital for buying additional Bitcoin and launching new products.

#### **2. Validate the "Dual-Engine" Advisory Business (The Execution Unknown)**

*   **Question:** What concrete revenue model, organizational structure, or key personnel (beyond the CEO/CIO) have been announced to run the **Bitcoin-native advisory services for corporates and sovereigns**?
*   **Investigation:** Search specifically for BSTR's detailed **business plan, organizational chart,** or **hiring announcements** related to institutional sales, financial modeling, or compliance teams. While the CEO detailed the active treasury management (selling puts, revolvers), the revenue-generating advisory service is a separate, highly specialized business line that currently appears to be just a stated intention.
*   **Why it matters:** The bull case relies on a "powerful, dual-engine growth model," but the bear case dismisses the advisory services as "unproven and overly ambitious." Finding evidence of a dedicated team or a sales pipeline will determine if BSTR is a true financial services firm or simply a Bitcoin holding company with an advisory mandate.

#### **3. Analyze the Investor Class and Dilution (The Stock Performance Unknown)**

*   **Question:** Given the extreme dilution (e.g., the CEP/XXI SPAC had a public shareholder stake of only 2.7%), what is the projected **public shareholder equity percentage** and the **fully-diluted share count** for the CEPO/BSTR merger?
*   **Investigation:** This information should also be in the most recent S-4/A filing. Look for the "Pro Forma Unaudited Condensed Combined Financial Information" section. Compare the public shareholder's post-merger ownership percentage with the ownership of the founders/PIPE investors.
*   **Why it matters:** The extreme post-announcement jump in the sister SPAC (CEP) was quickly followed by a realization of massive public shareholder dilution. Understanding the final equity stake will directly determine the upside potential for a retail investor and the true *Bitcoin per share* value after all Founder Shares and Convertible Notes (with the \$13 conversion price) are factored in.
