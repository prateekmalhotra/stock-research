# FTAI Aviation Ltd. (FTAI) Stock Valuation

This valuation uses a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on management's reported financial results, strategic guidance from recent earnings calls, and conservative assumptions to project future free cash flow (proxied by Net Income).

## 1. Financial Data & Assumptions

### A. Core Financial Inputs (as of September 30, 2025)

| Metric | Value (USD) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$509.95 million | Consolidated Balance Sheet, Q3 2025 |
| **Total Debt (Long-term debt, net)** | \$3,446.73 million | Consolidated Balance Sheet, Q3 2025 |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | 103.97 million | Q3 2025 Diluted Weighted Average |
| **Current Stock Price** | \$275.50 | Recent Market Price |

### B. Business Engine & Financial Assumptions

FTAI's business engine is transitioning to an **asset-light, high-margin Maintenance, Repair, and Exchange (MRE) model** for CFM56 and V2500 jet engines, housed in the **Aerospace Products** segment. The engine for growth is proprietary technology (Module Factory, PMA parts) and the Strategic Capital Initiative (SCI).

*   **Aerospace Products (AP) Segment:** This is the primary value driver. Management's 2026 guidance implies a high-growth, high-margin business.
*   **Aviation Leasing (AL) Segment:** This segment is shrinking as assets are sold into the SCI partnerships, generating servicing fees and gains on sale, leading to an **asset-light** model where FTAI acts as an asset manager.

| Assumption | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AP EBITDA Margin** | 35.0% | Conservative use of reported Q3 2025 segment margin for the core growth business. |
| **AL EBITDA Margin** | 30.0% | Conservative margin assumption for the asset-light Leasing/Servicing model (lower than AP, but still high-margin). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 15.0% | Conservative use of the YTD Q3 2025 effective tax rate (14.2%), considering US/Foreign corporate subsidiaries tax exposure despite Cayman Islands domicile. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | 15.0% | Conservative rate to reflect the high-return nature of the proprietary MRE business and the efficient capital deployment via the SCI, which raises third-party capital for assets. This is lower than some reported figures but remains aggressive and reasonable. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy)** | 10.0% | Conservative but reasonable rate for an aerospace/leasing company with significant debt and high growth potential. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | 3.0% | Very conservative long-term growth rate, slightly above long-term inflation, representing the market saturation and stability post-2030. |

## 2. Revenue and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

### A. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

| Metric | 2025 (Est.) | 2026 (Guidance) | 2027 (Proj.) | 2028 (Proj.) | 2029 (Proj.) | 2030 (Proj.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AP Adj. EBITDA (M)** | \$710 | \$1,000 | \$1,150 | \$1,265 | \$1,392 | \$1,462 |
| *AP Revenue (M)* | *\$2,029* | *\$2,857* | *\$3,286* | *\$3,614* | *\$3,975* | *\$4,181* |
| **AL Adj. EBITDA (M)** | \$490 | \$525 | \$551 | \$578 | \$607 | \$620 |
| *AL Revenue (M)* | *\$1,633* | *\$1,750* | *\$1,838* | *\$1,930* | *\$2,027* | *\$2,070* |
| **Total Adj. EBITDA (M)** | **\$1,200** | **\$1,525** | **\$1,701** | **\$1,843** | **\$2,000** | **\$2,082** |
| **Total Revenue (M)** | **\$3,662** | **\$4,607** | **\$5,124** | **\$5,544** | **\$6,002** | **\$6,251** |
| **Revenue Growth Rate** | | 25.8% | 11.2% | 8.2% | 8.2% | 4.1% |

**Justification for Revenue Growth:**
*   **2025:** Based on a conservative run-rate of the Q3 2025 results (Adj. EBITDA: \$1,200M).
*   **2026:** Directly uses management's raised guidance for segment EBITDA of \$1.525 billion. Revenue is reverse-engineered using the conservative 35% AP margin and 30% AL margin assumptions.
*   **2027-2029:** The high growth continues, but conservatively decelerates:
    *   **AP:** Proj. growth of **15%** for 2027, followed by **10%** for 2028-2029, reflecting the rapid ramp-up of new capacity (e.g., IAG Engine Center Europe, new joint ventures) and increasing MRE market penetration, as the company targets a larger share of the $22 billion addressable market.
    *   **AL:** Proj. growth of **5%** for 2027-2029, reflecting stable, management-fee-like revenue from the fully deployed SCI vehicle.
*   **2030:** A conservative step-down to **4.1%** for both segments, anticipating market saturation of the proprietary MRE product lines and maturity of the SCI model.

### B. Net Income Calculation

We use the annualized D\&A and Interest Expense from Q3 2025 as a base, assuming a modest 5% annual increase for D\&A due to continued capital investment in the AP segment (Module Factory expansion) and constant Interest Expense, reflecting management's target of maintaining a steady, optimized debt profile.

*   **Annual D&A (Base):** \$272 million (Q3 2025 Quarterly D&A of \$67.9M * 4)
*   **Annual Interest Expense (Base):** \$243 million (Q3 2025 Quarterly Interest Exp. of \$60.8M * 4)

| Metric (USD M) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Adj. EBITDA** | 1,200 | 1,525 | 1,701 | 1,843 | 2,000 | 2,082 |
| *Less: Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)* | (272) | (286) | (300) | (315) | (331) | (348) |
| *Less: Interest Expense* | (243) | (243) | (243) | (243) | (243) | (243) |
| **EBT (Earnings Before Tax)** | **685** | **996** | **1,158** | **1,285** | **1,426** | **1,491** |
| *Less: Tax (15.0%)* | (103) | (149) | (174) | (193) | (214) | (224) |
| **Net Income (NI) (from Business)** | **582** | **847** | **984** | **1,092** | **1,212** | **1,267** |
| **NI from Reinvestment (ROIC * Prior NI)** | 0 | 87 | 132 | 167 | 196 | 219 |
| **Projected Net Income (Cash Flow)** | **582** | **934** | **1,116** | **1,259** | **1,408** | **1,486** |

**Justification for ROIC Impact:**
The valuation explicitly mandates a re-investment loop: Net Income for the next year is the projected business NI *plus* **ROIC * (Net Income from Previous Year)**. The conservative **15% ROIC** reflects the company's capital recycling and high-return business model (MRE/SCI).
*   **2026 NI from Reinvestment:** \$582M * 15.0% = \$87M.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year | Projected Net Income (M) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | \$582 | 0.909 | \$529.1 |
| 2026 | \$934 | 0.826 | \$771.5 |
| 2027 | \$1,116 | 0.751 | \$838.1 |
| 2028 | \$1,259 | 0.683 | \$859.9 |
| 2029 | \$1,408 | 0.621 | \$874.6 |
| 2030 | \$1,486 | 0.564 | \$838.0 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **\$4,711.2** |

### B. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value assumes the 2030 cash flow will grow perpetually at a conservative maturity rate of **3.0%**.

*   **Terminal Value (TV):** (2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   **TV:** (\$1,486M * 1.03) / (0.10 - 0.03) = \$1,530.58M / 0.07 = **\$21,865.4 million**

### C. NPV of Terminal Value

*   **NPV of TV (at 2030):** $21,865.4 million
*   **Discount Factor (for 2030):** 0.564
*   **NPV of TV (Today):** $21,865.4M * 0.564 = **\$12,336.9 million**

### D. Total Equity Value

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** NPV of Projected Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value
    *   TEV = \$4,711.2M + \$12,336.9M = **\$17,048.1 million**
*   **Equity Value:** TEV + Total Cash & Equivalents - Total Debt
    *   Equity Value = \$17,048.1M + \$509.95M - \$3,446.73M = **\$14,111.3 million**

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

*   **Fair Value Per Share:** Total Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   Fair Value Per Share = \$14,111.3 million / 103.97 million shares = **\$135.73**

## 5. Final Comparison and Justification

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Data | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$135.73** | **\$275.50** | **-50.7%** |

### Justification for Difference

The calculated fair value of **\$135.73** is less than half of the current market price of **\$275.50**. This indicates a significant difference in the market's assumptions compared to the conservative DCF model used here.

**Why the Market is $\gg$ Valuation (Market's Assumptions):**

1.  **Much Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** The market is likely pricing in a **significantly higher long-term growth rate** than the conservative 3.0% used here. If we back-solve for the terminal growth rate (g) that justifies the current price:
    *   The implied required perpetuity growth rate is approximately **6.6%**.
    *   This suggests the market believes FTAI's MRE business, which leverages proprietary technology to capture share of the engine aftermarket, is a multi-decade growth story that can sustain high growth *well beyond* the 2030 projection, possibly due to long-term high-demand for the CFM56 engine.

2.  **Higher ROIC / FCF Conversion:** The market may be assuming a much **higher Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** and/or a more aggressive FCF conversion. FTAI's pivot to the asset-light model via the SCI partnership suggests a future of high FCF generation with minimal need for large capital expenditures on assets (Leasing Segment), thereby increasing the cash flow available to shareholders. The market may be projecting an ROIC closer to the implied 20%+ or assuming all Net Income (or EBITDA) is convertible to FCF after 2030.

3.  **Future SCI Vehicles & Scale:** The market is factoring in the successful launch and scale-up of the initial SCI vehicle (\$6B deployment goal) and assuming **multiple successful future SCI partnerships** (SCI-2, SCI-3, etc.), creating a massive, long-term asset management fee stream (which is a very high-margin business).

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated fair value of **\$135.73** is highly sensitive to the **Terminal Growth Rate**. Given the unique, high-growth, high-margin, and asset-light nature of the core **Aerospace Products MRE business** and the revolutionary **Strategic Capital Initiative** model, it is likely that the market is justified in its more aggressive growth assumptions. The market is valuing FTAI as a high-growth *technology/asset management* company in the aerospace sector, not as a mature leasing company.

**Final Fair Value Per Share (based on conservative DCF):**
