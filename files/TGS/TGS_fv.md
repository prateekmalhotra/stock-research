## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projection

TGS's business engine is segmented: **Natural Gas Transportation** (Regulated), **Liquids Production and Commercialization** (Commercial/Export), and **Midstream/Other Services** (Vaca Muerta infrastructure).

The critical driver is the change in the regulatory environment:
*   **Regulatory Reset:** The Natural Gas Transportation segment, which typically relies on firm-contracted capacity (80-84% of segment revenues), experienced a massive **675% tariff increase** in April 2024 with subsequent monthly adjustments. This is the long-awaited tariff correction and regulatory reset, shifting the segment from perpetual operating losses to profitability. This stabilizes the core, low-risk revenue stream.
*   **Growth Engine (Vaca Muerta):** Strategic infrastructure investments in the Vaca Muerta shale basin position TGS as a major Midstream player in Argentina, which is the primary source of volume growth. This revenue is generally USD-linked.

**Revenue Projection Justification (in USD millions):**

| Year | Revenue Base | Annual Growth Rate | Revenue Projection | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $\$1,181.9$ | - | - | Baseline (Full Year of Tariff Reset Effect) |
| **2025** | $\$1,181.9$ | $10.0\%$ | $\$1,300.0$ | **Conservative Post-Reset Stabilization:** Reflects the first full year of stable (USD-linked) tariffs and continued ramp-up of Vaca Muerta midstream infrastructure. |
| **2026** | $\$1,300.0$ | $7.0\%$ | $\$1,391.0$ | **Accelerated Midstream Growth:** Continued monetization of Vaca Muerta investments and pipeline capacity expansion. |
| **2027** | $\$1,391.0$ | $7.0\%$ | $\$1,488.4$ | Continued Vaca Muerta ramp-up. |
| **2028** | $\$1,488.4$ | $4.0\%$ | $\$1,547.9$ | **Moderation:** Growth rate moderates as Vaca Muerta projects mature. |
| **2029** | $\$1,547.9$ | $4.0\%$ | $\$1,609.8$ | Steady growth. |
| **2030** | $\$1,609.8$ | $4.0\%$ | $\$1,674.2$ | Steady growth before terminal value. |

## 3. Margin, ROIC & Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-Term Net Income Margin** | $25.0\%$ | Conservative reduction from the 2024 margin (30.3\%) to account for macroeconomic and regulatory volatility in Argentina. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | $5.0\%$ | Conservative, positive ROIC, reflecting the stable, utility-like nature of the transportation business and management's ability to generate returns on retained earnings, which must be assumed to be positive for future income generation. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | $15.0\%$ | **Conservative but Reasonable:** Reflects the extremely high country-specific risk of Argentina (political instability, hyperinflation, regulatory risk). This is a punitive rate compared to a typical US utility (4-8\%). |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate** | $2.0\%$ | A conservative perpetual growth rate, slightly above long-term developed-market inflation but below the long-term potential of the Midstream segment. |

### Projected Net Income and NPV (USD in millions)

The Net Income for each year is calculated as:
**Net Income Year N = (Projected Revenue Year N * Margin) + (Net Income Year N-1 * ROIC)**

| Year | Projected Revenue (USD M) | Net Income Margin | NI from Operations (A) | NI from ROIC (B) | Total Net Income (A+B) | Discount Factor (15.0%) | NPV of Net Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $\$1,300.0$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$325.0$ | $\$17.9$ | $\$342.9$ | 0.870 | $\$298.3$ |
| **2026** | $\$1,391.0$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$347.8$ | $\$17.1$ | $\$364.8$ | 0.756 | $\$275.6$ |
| **2027** | $\$1,488.4$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$372.1$ | $\$18.2$ | $\$390.3$ | 0.658 | $\$256.9$ |
| **2028** | $\$1,547.9$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$387.0$ | $\$19.5$ | $\$406.4$ | 0.572 | $\$232.5$ |
| **2029** | $\$1,609.8$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$402.5$ | $\$20.3$ | $\$422.8$ | 0.497 | $\$210.0$ |
| **2030** | $\$1,674.2$ | $25.0\%$ | $\$418.6$ | $\$21.1$ | $\$439.7$ | 0.432 | $\$190.1$ |
| **Sum of NPV of Net Income** | | | | | | | **$\$1,463.4$** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of End of 2030)

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all future cash flows beyond 2030.

*   Terminal Value (TV) = [Net Income Year 2030 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
*   TV = [$\$439.7 \text{ M} * (1 + 0.02)] / (0.15 - 0.02)$
*   TV = $\$448.5 \text{ M} / 0.13 = \$3,449.9 \text{ million}$

### Terminal Value Discounted to Present Day (Today)

*   NPV of Terminal Value = TV / $(1 + \text{WACC})^\text{Years to Maturity}$
*   NPV of TV = $\$3,449.9 \text{ M} / (1.15)^{6} = \$3,449.9 \text{ M} / 2.313 = **\$1,491.5 \text{ million}$**

### Total Equity Value Calculation

*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** = NPV of Net Income (2025-2030) + NPV of Terminal Value
*   TEV = $\$1,463.4 \text{ M} + \$1,491.5 \text{ M} = **\$2,954.9 \text{ million}$**

*   **Fair Equity Value** = TEV + Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
*   Fair Equity Value = $\$2,954.9 \text{ M} + \$40.8 \text{ M} - \$591.8 \text{ M} = **\$2,403.9 \text{ million}$**

---

## 4. Fair Value Conclusion

*   **Fair Value per Share** = Fair Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value per Share = $\$2,403.9 \text{ million} / 752,761,058 \text{ shares} = **\$3.19$**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$\$3.19$** |
| **Current Market Value per Share** | **$\$31.53$** |

---

## 5. Justification and Market Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **\$3.19** is significantly lower than the current market price of **\$31.53**.

### Justification of Assumptions

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC of 15.0%):** This is a high and conservative rate, appropriate for an Argentine-domiciled utility. Any reduction in this rate (i.e., less perceived risk) would drastically increase the fair value.
2.  **Perpetual Growth Rate (2.0%):** This is conservative for a growth-oriented Midstream business (Vaca Muerta) but appropriate for the long-term outlook of a highly regulated utility in a volatile economy.
3.  **Net Income Margin (25.0%):** This is a conservative reduction from the 2024 figure of 30.3\%, reflecting anticipated pressure in a volatile market.
4.  **Revenue Growth (4.0% - 10.0%):** This assumes a successful but conservative ramp-up of the Vaca Muerta infrastructure (Midstream) and stable performance in the regulated segment due to the recent tariff reset.

### Market Assumptions Justification

The significant market premium suggests investors are making *much more aggressive* assumptions about TGS's future, likely driven by a view that the company is effectively a dollar-linked play on the future of the Vaca Muerta shale basin, and that the regulatory risk is largely over.

The market is likely assuming the following:

1.  **Significantly Lower Discount Rate:** The market is likely pricing TGS closer to a US/international energy midstream company due to the USD-linked nature of the Liquids and Midstream businesses. A WACC closer to **9.0%** to **10.0%** would be necessary to bridge the gap.
2.  **Higher Perpetual Growth:** The market assumes the Vaca Muerta development will drive a much higher long-term perpetual growth rate, perhaps **4.0%** to **5.0%**, as the Argentine energy sector liberalizes and exports increase.
3.  **Sustained Higher Margins:** The market assumes the new regulatory framework will hold, allowing for sustained Net Income Margins near or above the 2024 result of **30.0\%+**.

**Why the Valuation is Different:**

The vast difference is due to the mandatory *conservative* approach applied to the DCF model, primarily via the **15.0% discount rate**. This rate strictly accounts for the extreme sovereign and regulatory risk of the Republic of Argentina, which the market appears to be *discounting* (i.e., ignoring) in favor of the highly optimistic long-term growth potential of Vaca Muerta and the implied **dollar-linked value** of its infrastructure. The valuation suggests the market is pricing TGS as an **unregulated, low-risk, international midstream growth story**, whereas a conservative DCF must price it as a **high-risk, regulated Argentine utility** with a volatile growth engine.
