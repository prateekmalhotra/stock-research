The valuation of Pets at Home Group Plc (PAHGF) is conducted using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, which projects the company's unlevered cash flow (using Net Income as a proxy, as per the rules) from 2026 to 2030 and its terminal value, discounted back to the present. All figures are in millions of British Pounds (£m) unless otherwise noted.

The valuation is based on the latest available financial data from the FY25 Preliminary Results (for the period ended March 2025).

## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections

Pets at Home operates a two-part business engine:
1.  **Vet Group:** The high-growth, high-margin, capital-light Joint Venture (JV) model, which increasingly underpins the predictability of profits. In FY25, Vet Group consumer revenue grew 13.0%.
2.  **Retail Group:** The core pet care centers and online business, which experienced a subdued year (FY25 consumer revenue down 1.8%) due to macro factors and a platform transition, but is built on a "platform that is fit for the future".

The management's medium-term ambition is for **Consumer Revenue Growth of 7%**. I will use a conservative model that sees total revenue growth trend towards this ambition as the new platform is fully operational and the Vet Group continues its strong outperformance. The statutory revenue breakdown is not explicitly given, so I will model a blend of the underlying consumer revenue growth and apply it to the statutory base.

| Year (FY ending March) | **2025** (Actual) | **2026** (Proj.) | **2027** (Proj.) | **2028** (Proj.) | **2029** (Proj.) | **2030** (Proj.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statutory Revenue (£m)** | 1,482.1 | 1,570.8 | 1,664.6 | 1,760.4 | 1,858.9 | 1,960.6 |
| **Growth Rate (Total)** | 0.1% | **5.0%** | **6.0%** | **5.7%** | **5.6%** | **5.5%** |
| *Vet Group Consumer Revenue Growth* | 13.0% | **11.0%** | **10.0%** | **9.0%** | **8.0%** | **7.0%** |
| *Retail Consumer Revenue Growth* | -1.8% | **2.0%** | **3.0%** | **4.0%** | **5.0%** | **5.0%** |

***Justification for Revenue Growth:***
*   The high-growth Vet Group is conservatively stepped down from its FY25 actual of 13.0%, moving towards a long-term, high-single-digit growth rate, reflecting a conservative view on the "strong sales growth" and the **unique joint venture model**.
*   The Retail Group is conservatively assumed to recover from its FY25 decline of 1.8% to a modest $2.0\%$ in FY26, and gradually increase to $5.0\%$ by FY29, leveraging the newly built "platform" and improved digital capability, but remaining conservative against the overall market.
*   The resulting total revenue growth for the Group is conservative, reaching a maximum of 6.0% in 2027 before gradually settling, staying safely below the 7% medium-term ambition.

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

The Net Income margin is expected to expand due to the faster growth of the higher-margin Vet Group business.

*   **Initial Net Income Margin (FY25):** 5.9% (as calculated above).
*   **Target Terminal Net Income Margin (Post-2030):** 7.0%. This is a conservative assumption, reflecting an increase of $\sim$110 basis points over six years, driven by the structural shift towards high-margin services.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative but reasonable **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 15.0%** is used. This is less than the Group's underlying Cash Return on Invested Capital (CROIC) of 20.1% reported in H1 FY24 [cite: 2 (from step 1)].

| Year (FY ending March) | **2025** (Actual) | **2026** (Proj.) | **2027** (Proj.) | **2028** (Proj.) | **2029** (Proj.) | **2030** (Proj.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statutory Revenue (£m)** | 1,482.1 | 1,570.8 | 1,664.6 | 1,760.4 | 1,858.9 | 1,960.6 |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 5.9% | 6.1% | 6.3% | 6.6% | 6.8% | 7.0% |
| **Base Net Income (£m)** | 87.4 | 95.8 | 104.9 | 116.2 | 126.4 | 137.2 |
| **Income from Prior NI ROIC ($\text{£m}$)** | - | 13.1 | 14.4 | 15.7 | 17.4 | 18.9 |
| **Total Projected Net Income ($\text{£m}$)** | - | **108.9** | **119.3** | **131.9** | **143.8** | **156.1** |

*(Calculation: Total Projected Net Income for next year = Base Net Income from that year + Prior Year's Net Income $\times$ ROIC (15.0%))*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** **8.0%**. This is a reasonable mid-range WACC for a company in the UK retail/services sector with modest debt, balancing the lower risk of the Vet Group with the higher volatility of Retail.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate, g):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative long-term growth assumption, slightly above long-term UK GDP/inflation projections.

### NPV Calculation

The terminal value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:
$$\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{FY31}}}{(\text{WACC} - \text{g})}$$

| Year (FY ending March) | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) (£m)** | 108.9 | 119.3 | 131.9 | 143.8 | 156.1 |
| **Discount Factor ($1 / (1 + 0.08)^t$)** | 0.9259 | 0.8573 | 0.7938 | 0.7350 | 0.6806 |
| **Net Present Value (NPV) of Cash Flow (£m)** | **100.8** | **102.3** | **104.7** | **105.7** | **106.2** |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | **£519.7m** |

### Terminal Value Calculation
1.  **FY31 Projected Cash Flow:** $\text{FY30 Net Income} \times (1 + \text{g}) = \text{£156.1m} \times (1 + 0.02) = \text{£159.2m}$
2.  **Terminal Value (2030):** $\frac{\text{£159.2m}}{(0.08 - 0.02)} = \text{£2,653.3m}$
3.  **NPV of Terminal Value (Discounted to 2025):** $\text{£2,653.3m} \times \text{0.6806} = \text{£1,805.8m}$

### Total Equity Value (Fair Value of Company)
| Metric | Value ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2026-2030)** | 519.7 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | 1,805.8 |
| **Less: Total Debt (Non-Lease Liabilities)** | (33.3) |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | 39.5 |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **2,331.7** |

---

## 5. Fair Value Per Share

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\text{£2,331.7m}}{448.28\text{m}} = \text{£5.20}$$

---

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **£5.20** |
| **Current Stock Price (PAHGF/PETS)** | **£2.14** |
| **Difference** | **143.0% Higher** |

### Justification for Divergence

The calculated Fair Value of **£5.20** is significantly higher than the current market price of $\text{£2.14}$. This large divergence indicates that the market is making much more conservative assumptions about the company's future cash flows than the base case presented here, or is pricing in significant near-term risks.

**The market is likely pricing in the following conservative/negative factors:**

1.  **Regulatory Risk (CMA Investigation):** The ongoing investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the UK veterinary sector introduces a material, unquantifiable risk to the Vet Group's profitability, which is the company's key growth engine. The market may be assuming a worst-case scenario where fee caps or mandatory divestments severely restrict the high margins and growth of the Vet Group.
2.  **Retail Headwinds:** The market is likely giving much less credit to the Retail business recovery. Retail consumer revenue was down 1.8% in FY25. The conservative recovery I project (moving from 2.0% to 5.0% growth) may be seen by the market as overly optimistic given the "subdued market" and "soft UK consumer backdrop".
3.  **Platform Investment Payback:** The valuation assumes a relatively smooth realization of benefits from the platform investment, driving margin expansion. The market might be assuming that the benefits are further off, or that the cost headwinds in FY26 will completely negate profit growth in the short term, despite management confidence.
4.  **Discount Rate/Risk Premium:** The market's effective discount rate (WACC) for Pets at Home is likely significantly higher than my conservative $\text{8.0\%}$ assumption, factoring in the UK macro-economic uncertainty and specific regulatory risks. For the market price of $\text{£2.14}$ to be the fair value, using the same growth/margin assumptions, the implied WACC would be significantly higher (approaching 12-15%).

**Conclusion on Valuation:**

The DCF value of $\text{£5.20}$ represents a valuation where the company successfully executes its strategy: the new platform delivers the expected synergy and growth in Retail, and the high-growth, high-margin Vet Group continues its trajectory without being materially impaired by regulatory intervention. The market is overwhelmingly focused on the current economic headwinds and regulatory risks, applying a massive discount to future cash flows. This valuation suggests the stock is **significantly undervalued** if the regulatory risk proves manageable and the business successfully translates its strategic investments into sustained revenue and margin growth.
