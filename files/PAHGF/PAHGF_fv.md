### **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections**

Pets at Home's engine is built on two primary, distinct, and high-quality revenue streams: **Retail** and the **Vet Group**. Management's strategy is to grow the high-margin **Vet Group** faster and drive "share of wallet" from its loyal, growing $\mathbf{8.2m}$ Pets Club members through subscriptions, which grew $\mathbf{30\%}$ YoY in FY25.

*   **Management Guidance:** "Grow consumer revenue at mid-single digit rate per year, outperforming the UK pet care market." The Vet Group now contributes $\mathbf{>50\%}$ of Group profits and cash flow and is described as "fundamentally more cash generative".

The revenue model is split into its two core segments, with the Vet Group providing an increasingly favorable mix shift.

| Segment | FY25 Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | 2026 Growth Rate | 2027 Growth Rate | 2028 Growth Rate | 2029 Growth Rate | 2030 Growth Rate | Justification (Conservative Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vet Group** | $\text{£}655.1\text{m}$ | $11.0\%$ | $10.0\%$ | $9.0\%$ | $8.0\%$ | $7.0\%$ | Step-down from FY25's $\mathbf{13.0\%}$ growth to reflect conservatism and market maturity, but remains high due to its unique JV model, strong Care Plan subscriptions (over half of vet consumers), and high average spend. |
| **Retail Group** | $\text{£}1,306.8\text{m}$ | $2.5\%$ | $3.0\%$ | $3.5\%$ | $3.5\%$ | $3.0\%$ | Conservative recovery from FY25's $\mathbf{-1.8\%}$ decline, reflecting stable food/consumables and a moderate recovery in accessories due to full benefits of the new DC and digital platform. This is conservative vs. the mid-single-digit *Consumer Revenue* target. |

#### **Projected Revenue Table ($\text{£m}$)**

| Year (FY ending March) | Vet Group Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | Retail Group Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | Total Projected Revenue ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25 (Actual)** | $\text{£}655.1\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,306.8\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}1,961.9\text{m}}$ |
| **FY26** | $\text{£}727.1\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,339.5\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,066.6\text{m}}$ |
| **FY27** | $\text{£}800.0\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,379.7\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,179.7\text{m}}$ |
| **FY28** | $\text{£}872.0\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,428.1\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,300.1\text{m}}$ |
| **FY29** | $\text{£}941.8\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,478.0\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,419.8\text{m}}$ |
| **FY30** | $\text{£}1,008.7\text{m}$ | $\text{£}1,522.3\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,531.0\text{m}}$ |

### **3. Margin and Net Income Projections**

The Net Income Margin (Statutory Net Income / Statutory Revenue) for FY25 is $\approx 6.1\%$ ($\text{£}90.45\text{m} / \text{£}1,482.1\text{m}$). Management commentary highlights the increasing contribution of the higher-margin Vet Group to profits. Therefore, a gradual, conservative improvement in the Net Income Margin is projected due to this favorable mix shift.

The Net Income for the following year includes an additional income component derived from the previous year's accumulated Net Income (now considered cash) invested at the conservative ROIC of $\mathbf{7.5\%}$.

**Net Income (t) = (Projected Revenue (t) * Net Margin (t)) + (Net Income (t-1) * 7.5\%)**

| Year (FY ending March) | Projected Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | Net Income Margin ($\%$) | Net Income from Operations ($\text{£m}$) | ROIC Income ($\text{£m}$) | Total Net Income ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25 (Base)** | $\text{£}1,482.1\text{m}$ | $6.1\%$ | $\text{£}90.45\text{m}$ | N/A | $\mathbf{\text{£}90.45\text{m}}$ |
| **FY26** | $\text{£}2,066.6\text{m}$ | $6.2\%$ | $\text{£}128.13\text{m}$ | $\text{£}6.78\text{m}$ ($\text{£}90.45\text{m} \times 7.5\% \text{ excl } \text{NI}_{25}$) | $\mathbf{\text{£}134.91\text{m}}$ |
| **FY27** | $\text{£}2,179.7\text{m}$ | $6.3\%$ | $\text{£}137.32\text{m}$ | $\text{£}10.12\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}147.44\text{m}}$ |
| **FY28** | $\text{£}2,300.1\text{m}$ | $6.4\%$ | $\text{£}147.21\text{m}$ | $\text{£}11.06\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}158.27\text{m}}$ |
| **FY29** | $\text{£}2,419.8\text{m}$ | $6.5\%$ | $\text{£}157.29\text{m}$ | $\text{£}11.87\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}169.16\text{m}}$ |
| **FY30** | $\text{£}2,531.0\text{m}$ | $6.6\%$ | $\text{£}166.80\text{m}$ | $\text{£}12.69\text{m}$ | $\mathbf{\text{£}179.49\text{m}}$ |

*Note: For the ROIC calculation, the starting Net Income is adjusted for cash from the previous year's calculation to avoid double counting and to reflect new income from accumulated past profits.*

### **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

A conservative Discount Rate ($\mathbf{9.0\%}$) and a low Maturity Rate ($\mathbf{2.0\%}$) are used to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of future cash flows.

#### **NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030)**

| Year | Total Net Income ($\text{£m}$) | Discount Factor ($\frac{1}{(1+0.09)^{t}}$) | Net Present Value ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (t=1)** | $\text{£}134.91\text{m}$ | $0.9174$ | $\text{£}123.77\text{m}$ |
| **2027 (t=2)** | $\text{£}147.44\text{m}$ | $0.8417$ | $\text{£}124.08\text{m}$ |
| **2028 (t=3)** | $\text{£}158.27\text{m}$ | $0.7722$ | $\text{£}122.21\text{m}$ |
| **2029 (t=4)** | $\text{£}169.16\text{m}$ | $0.7084$ | $\text{£}119.84\text{m}$ |
| **2030 (t=5)** | $\text{£}179.49\text{m}$ | $0.6499$ | $\text{£}116.65\text{m}$ |
| **Total NPV of Project Period** | | | $\mathbf{\text{£}606.55\text{m}}$ |

#### **Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after 2030.

$\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$

$\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\text{£}179.49\text{m} \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.09 - 0.02)} = \frac{\text{£}183.08\text{m}}{0.07} = \text{£}2,615.43\text{m}$

**NPV of Terminal Value**

$\text{NPV}(\text{TV}) = \text{TV}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{t=5}$

$\text{NPV}(\text{TV}) = \text{£}2,615.43\text{m} \times 0.6499 = \mathbf{\text{£}1,700.08\text{m}}$

#### **Total Equity Value**

| Component | Value ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Project Period (2026-2030) | $\text{£}606.55\text{m}$ |
| NPV of Terminal Value | $\text{£}1,700.08\text{m}$ |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,306.63\text{m}}$ |
| *Add: Current Total Cash* | $+\text{£}39.5\text{m}$ |
| *Subtract: Total Debt (Non-Lease)* | $-\text{£}33.3\text{m}$ |
| **Fair Equity Value** | $\mathbf{\text{£}2,312.83\text{m}}$ |

---

### **5. Fair Value Per Share**

**Fair Value Per Share** = $\frac{\text{Fair Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$

$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{£}2,312.83\text{m}}{454.93\text{m} \text{ shares}} = \mathbf{\text{£}5.08} \text{ per share}$

### **Fair Value of Pets at Home Group Plc (PAHGF) Stock**

The calculated **Fair Value** for Pets at Home Group Plc (PAHGF) stock is **$\text{£}5.08$** per share (or **508 pence**).

The **Current Market Value** of the stock is approximately **$\text{£}2.15$** per share (or **215 pence**).

---

### **6. Justification and Market Assumptions**

The calculated fair value of $\mathbf{\text{£}5.08}$ is significantly higher than the current market value of $\mathbf{\text{£}2.15}$.

**Justification for the Fair Value Discrepancy (Why my assumption is different from the market):**

1.  **Market Pessimism on Retail & Macro Headwinds:** The market is heavily discounting the company due to short-term issues and macro uncertainty.
    *   **FY25 Retail Decline:** The $1.8\%$ decline in retail revenue in FY25 and the one-off costs from the distribution center transition created a negative narrative, causing the stock to trade more like a struggling retailer rather than an integrated, high-growth pet care platform.
    *   **CMA Investigation:** Uncertainty around the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into the Vet Group is a major overhang, which the market is likely pricing in as a risk of forced structural change or lower profitability in the high-growth segment. Management, however, has highlighted the unique and differentiated nature of their joint venture model as a source of confidence.

2.  **Undervaluation of the Vet Group's Quality:** My model, based on management's commentary, assumes the high-growth, high-margin, and **"fundamentally more cash generative"** Vet Group will continue to be the primary value driver, steadily increasing its profit mix.
    *   The Vet Group grew consumer revenue by $\mathbf{13.0\%}$ in FY25 and is described as contributing **over half** the Group's profit and cash flow. The market appears to be assigning a much lower blended multiple, treating the entire group as a low-margin retailer.

3.  **Conservative Platform Payoff Assumptions:** My long-term growth assumptions are based on a conservative payoff from the "profound transformation" of the business, including the new digital platform, unified branding, and successful DC transition, all of which are now complete.
    *   The model assumes a moderate mid-to-high single-digit growth for the Vet business and a slow recovery for the Retail business. The strong growth in Pets Club members ($\mathbf{5\%}$ YoY to $\mathbf{8.2m}$) and subscriptions ($\mathbf{30\%}$ YoY) suggests a clear runway for "share of wallet" gains, which the market does not seem to fully acknowledge.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions:**
The market is likely assuming:
*   A **significantly lower terminal growth rate** (potentially closer to $0\% - 1\%$) or a **much higher discount rate** (reflecting high macro risk).
*   A **permanent compression of margins** due to higher costs or competitive pricing, invalidating the projected margin expansion from the mix shift.
*   A **negative outcome from the CMA investigation** that stifles the growth engine of the high-margin Vet Group.

**Conclusion:**
The calculated fair value of $\text{£}5.08$ is a strong indicator of $\text{PAHGF}$'s intrinsic value, assuming the company can execute on its stated strategy of leveraging its Vet Group and digital platform to drive sustained, profitable growth. The $\mathbf{136\%}$ difference between the fair value and the market price represents a clear case of market pessimism and undervaluation of the company's defensive, structural growth in the high-quality pet care sector and the long-term payoff from its strategic investments.
