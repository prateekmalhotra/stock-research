## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The business of Darling Ingredients is a dual engine:

1.  **Core Ingredients (Feed & Food):** This segment leverages its global scale, repurposing $\approx15\%$ of the world's meat industry waste streams. It is a stable, high-margin, defensive business with low cyclicality, driven by volume and value-added products like collagen and pet food ingredients.
2.  **Fuel Segment (Diamond Green Diesel - DGD):** A 50/50 joint venture, DGD has a large capacity of $\approx1.2$ billion gallons per year and is positioned in the high-growth renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) markets. However, its profitability is highly volatile and dependent on public policy, as seen by its recent negative EBITDA per gallon in Q3 2025.

### Revenue Assumptions (Millions USD)

| Year | Core Ingredients Growth | DGD Recovery | Total Revenue | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | 4.4% (vs 2024E) | Stabilization | **\$6,000** | Q1-Q3 2025 Revenue was \$4.4B. We assume a conservative Q4 (approx. \$1.6B) similar to Q3 2025 to reach a full-year \$6.0B. Management guided 2025 Core EBITDA (ex-DGD) to \$875-\$900M, confirming core stability. |
| **2026E** | 4.0% | Policy Recovery & DGD Normalization | **\$6,480** | **Core:** Conservative 4.0% growth driven by volume and expansion into high-margin nutrition markets (e.g., NexTIDA in 2026). **DGD:** Assumes regulatory and policy environment stabilizes, allowing DGD's $1.2B$ gallon capacity to monetize closer to its long-term potential. |
| **2027E** | 3.5% | SAF Ramp-up & Scale | **\$6,804** | **DGD:** Port Arthur SAF project comes fully online (50% of its 470M gal capacity can be SAF). The shift to higher-value SAF provides a revenue uplift and margin protection, justifying the growth despite core business growth slowing slightly. |
| **2028E** | 3.0% | Steady State | **\$7,008** | Both segments enter a normalized steady-state, with overall growth driven by the DGD capacity being fully utilized and the core business growing modestly. |
| **2029E** | 2.5% | Steady State | **\$7,183** | Conservative deceleration in overall revenue growth. |
| **2030E** | 2.0% | Steady State | **\$7,327** | Conservative, long-term, mature growth rate before terminal value. |

## 3. Margin and ROIC Projections

### Margin Projections

The Net Income Margin has been highly volatile due to DGD. To be **conservative** as per the rules, we must use an achievable, normalized margin, not the peak of the DGD boom years nor the current depressed margin (Q1-Q3 2025 Net Income Margin was $\approx 0.13\%$).

*   **Assumption:** We project a normalized, long-term Net Income Margin of **4.5\%**. This is conservative, as the company achieved significantly higher margins during profitable periods and a **24.7\% Gross Margin** in Q3 2025, which supports a higher long-term Net Income margin once DGD recovers.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | **Net Income** (B = A * Margin) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | \$6,000 | 2.5% | **\$150.0** |
| **2026E** | \$6,480 | 3.5% | **\$226.8** |
| **2027E** | \$6,804 | 4.0% | **\$272.2** |
| **2028E** | \$7,008 | 4.5% | **\$315.4** |
| **2029E** | \$7,183 | 4.5% | **\$323.2** |
| **2030E** | \$7,327 | 4.5% | **\$329.7** |

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Projection

The rule is: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.* This models a cash compounding effect.

*   **Assumption:** Given the strong fundamentals of the Core Ingredients business (high barriers to entry, integrated supply chain) and the capital discipline mentioned by management, a conservative, but positive, long-term ROIC of **4.0\%** is assumed for the cash generated and reinvested.

| Year | Net Income (B) | **Previous Year's Cash** (C) | ROIC (4.0%) (D = C * 4.0%) | **Adjusted Net Income (Cash Flow)** (B + D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025E** | \$150.0 | N/A | N/A | **\$150.0** |
| **2026E** | \$226.8 | \$150.0 | \$6.0 | **\$232.8** |
| **2027E** | \$272.2 | \$232.8 | \$9.3 | **\$281.5** |
| **2028E** | \$315.4 | \$281.5 | \$11.3 | **\$326.7** |
| **2029E** | \$323.2 | \$326.7 | \$13.1 | **\$336.3** |
| **2030E** | \$329.7 | \$336.3 | \$13.5 | **\$343.2** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### Conservative Discount & Terminal Rates

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0\%**. This reflects a moderate cost of equity/WACC, appropriate for a company with a stable core business but significant regulatory and commodity risk in its major growth driver (DGD).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate) (Very Conservative):** **2.0\%**. This is lower than the long-term expected global GDP growth and reflects the company's mature rendering operations while incorporating some future growth from the value-added products and SAF.

### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

$$
TV = \frac{\text{2030E Cash Flow} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}
$$

$$
TV = \frac{\$343.2 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$350.1}{0.07} = \$5,001.4 \text{ million}
$$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (CFt) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 9.0%)^t) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$150.0 | $0.9174$ | \$137.6 |
| **2026** | \$232.8 | $0.8417$ | \$196.0 |
| **2027** | \$281.5 | $0.7722$ | \$217.3 |
| **2028** | \$326.7 | $0.7084$ | \$231.4 |
| **2029** | \$336.3 | $0.6499$ | \$218.6 |
| **2030** | \$343.2 + \$5,001.4 (TV) | $0.5963$ | \$3,186.0 |
| **Sum of PV (NPV)** | | | **\$4,186.9** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value of Equity

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows** | \$4,186.9 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$91.5 |
| **Less: Total Debt (Gross)** | (\$4,101.5) |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **\$176.9** |

### Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$176.9 \text{ million}}{161.67 \text{ million}} = \mathbf{\$1.09}
$$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification of Disparity

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$1.09** |
| **Current Market Price (Approx.)** | **\$34.55** |

### Justification of Disparity: Why the Valuation is so Low

My calculated fair value of **\$1.09** per share is drastically lower than the current market price of **\$34.55**. This significant difference points to a massive disconnect between my conservative, historical-net-income-based DCF model and the market's assumptions.

The market is making a critical assumption that my model explicitly *does not* make: **The market is valuing the company based on a normalized, very high-margin, and high-growth Fuel Segment (DGD) business, likely projecting a quick and massive recovery.**

The key drivers of the market's much higher valuation are almost certainly:

1.  **High Multiple on Core EBITDA:** The market is likely applying a very high valuation multiple (e.g., $10-12\times$) to the stable Core Ingredients EBITDA (\$875-\$900M). This Core Business value alone could be $\approx\$9.0$ billion, which after subtracting debt, still results in a significantly higher share price.
2.  **Optimistic DGD/SAF Recovery:** The market is discounting the current volatility and pricing in a rapid recovery of the Renewable Fuel market, fueled by:
    *   **Full Utilization and High Margins on $1.2 Billion$ Gallons:** Assuming DGD's $1.2$ billion gallon capacity quickly returns to historical high-margin performance (driven by federal/state credits like RINs and LCFS).
    *   **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Premium:** The new SAF capability at Port Arthur is seen as a key, immediate, high-margin catalyst for future profits, not a slow-burn growth opportunity.
3.  **The Flaw in the "Net Income to Cash" DCF for a Volatile Company:** The primary reason for the low calculated value is the strict application of the rule: **"Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."** For a company whose net income is currently suppressed by regulatory uncertainty (DGD), its **current Net Income is not reflective of its true long-term free cash flow potential.** A more traditional Free Cash Flow (FCF) valuation, which would add back non-cash expenses like depreciation/amortization and subtract CapEx, would yield a much higher FCF figure and thus a much higher valuation. The FCF would likely be closer to the high end of their core EBITDA guidance of **\$875-\$900 million**, which would sustain the market price.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

My conservative, rules-based DCF is a severe undervaluation because the required use of suppressed **Net Income** as the sole cash flow proxy fails to capture the significant, high-margin, non-cash earnings from the **Diamond Green Diesel (DGD)** joint venture (which is accounted for on an equity method) and the robust, stable **EBITDA** of the core ingredients business.

The market is implicitly assuming a normalized annual FCF in the range of **\$500-\$600 million** (or higher) to justify the current stock price, driven by the massive underlying EBITDA of the combined business. My valuation, therefore, represents a **worst-case scenario** where DGD's short-term woes persist indefinitely and the company is only valued on its currently depressed bottom line.
