## 2. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

Darling Ingredients operates on three main segments: **Feed Ingredients**, **Food Ingredients** (notably the high-value collagen/gelatin business via Gelnex), and **Fuel Ingredients** (primarily the Diamond Green Diesel - DGD joint venture, which also produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel - SAF).

### A. Revenue (Net Sales) Engine Justification (2025 - 2030)

The key driver for future growth is the recovery and expansion of the **Fuel Ingredients** segment:
1.  **Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) Rebound:** The DGD joint venture experienced a difficult 2024 due to commodity volatility and policy uncertainty. Management, however, has expressed confidence in realizing the value of the **45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit** and expects a much stronger 2025 performance as DGD turnarounds are completed and SAF sales command a larger percentage of the mix. The new SAF unit started up in Q4 2024 and is expected to drive higher-value sales.
2.  **Core Ingredients Stability:** The core Feed and Food businesses are reported as stable, with steady raw material volumes. The Food segment's growth from the Gelnex acquisition adds a steady, high-margin component.

**Projection Methodology (Conservative):**
*   **2025:** I use a conservative **5.0%** growth rate, primarily driven by the full-year operation of the new SAF capacity and the expected rebound in DGD's performance and commodity pricing, as guided by management's optimistic 2025 outlook.
*   **2026 - 2030:** I model a declining Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from **5.0%** to **1.0%** by 2030. This is a conservative approach that assumes the high-growth cycle from the DGD/SAF capacity expansion matures, and the company reverts to a growth rate slightly above the expected long-term inflation rate. The CAGR for the entire period is approximately 3.9%.

| Year | 2024 (Base) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales (Billions)** | \$5.700 | \$5.985 | \$6.284 | \$6.535 | \$6.731 | \$6.866 | \$6.935 |
| **Annual Growth** | N/A | 5.0% | 5.0% | 4.0% | 3.0% | 2.0% | 1.0% |

### B. Net Income Margin Justification (2025 - 2030)

*   **2024 Margin:** 4.89% (Abnormally low, primarily due to DGD weakness)
*   **Projection:** I project a moderate, stable Net Income Margin of **5.5%** from 2025 onwards. This is a conservative figure, only a 61 basis point increase from the weak 2024 margin. It accounts for the anticipated higher-margin DGD/SAF segment rebound, combined with the stable, accretive margins from the Feed and Food businesses. The assumption of a flat 5.5% margin for all future years is conservative, as it ignores the potential for long-term margin expansion from debt paydown (reducing interest expense) and better operating leverage on the mature DGD/SAF assets.

### C. Financial Metric Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | **4.0%** | A conservative, reasonable positive ROIC is chosen to generate returns on retained earnings, as historical ROIC may be skewed by acquisition/project ramp-up and commodity volatility. |
| **Conservative Discount Rate (r)** | **9.0%** | A conservative rate chosen to represent the required return, acting as a proxy for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). |
| **Conservative Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **1.5%** | A very conservative rate, slightly above zero, well below expected long-term global GDP/inflation to represent a mature, steady-state growth rate. |

## 3. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow)

The projected Net Income for each year is calculated as:
**Projected Net Income = (Projected Net Sales * Net Income Margin) + (Prior Year's Retained Cash * ROIC)**

| Year | Net Sales (Millions) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) (Millions) | Prior Cash (B) (Millions) | ROIC (4.0%) on Prior Cash (C) | Projected Cash Flow (A+C) (Millions) | Cumulative Cash (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$5,700.0 | 4.89% | \$278.90 | N/A | N/A | N/A | \$278.90 |
| **2025** | \$5,985.0 | 5.5% | \$329.18 | \$278.90 | \$11.16 | **\$340.34** | \$619.24 |
| **2026** | \$6,284.2 | 5.5% | \$345.63 | \$619.24 | \$24.77 | **\$370.40** | \$989.64 |
| **2027** | \$6,537.6 | 5.5% | \$359.57 | \$989.64 | \$39.59 | **\$399.16** | \$1,388.80 |
| **2028** | \$6,733.7 | 5.5% | \$370.35 | \$1,388.80 | \$55.55 | **\$425.90** | \$1,814.70 |
| **2029** | \$6,868.4 | 5.5% | \$377.76 | \$1,814.70 | \$72.59 | **\$450.35** | \$2,265.05 |
| **2030** | \$6,937.1 | 5.5% | \$381.54 | \$2,265.05 | \$90.60 | **\$472.14** | \$2,737.19 |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated for the explicit period (2025-2030) and the Terminal Value (TV).

### A. Discounted Projected Cash Flow (2025 - 2030)

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$340.34 | 0.9174 | \$312.27 |
| **2026** | \$370.40 | 0.8417 | \$311.75 |
| **2027** | \$399.16 | 0.7722 | \$308.20 |
| **2028** | \$425.90 | 0.7084 | \$301.62 |
| **2029** | \$450.35 | 0.6499 | \$292.68 |
| **2030** | \$472.14 | 0.5963 | \$281.44 |
| **NPV of Explicit Cash Flow** | | | **\$1,807.96** |

### B. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The cash flow for the terminal year (2030) is the base for the TV calculation.

*   Terminal Value (TV) Formula: TV = [Cash Flow (2030) * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
*   TV = [\$472.14 Million * (1 + 0.015)] / (0.09 - 0.015)
*   TV = [\$479.22 Million] / 0.075
*   **Terminal Value = \$6,389.60 Million**

### C. Discounted Terminal Value (DTV)

The Terminal Value is discounted back to the present using the 2030 discount factor.

*   DTV = TV * Discount Factor (2030)
*   DTV = \$6,389.60 Million * 0.5963
*   **Discounted Terminal Value = \$3,809.84 Million**

### D. Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Firm

*   Total NPV = NPV of Explicit Cash Flow + Discounted Terminal Value
*   Total NPV = \$1,807.96 Million + \$3,809.84 Million
*   **Total NPV (Equity Value) = \$5,617.80 Million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The final fair value of the stock is calculated using the standard DCF formula:

| Metric | Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV (Equity Value)** | \$5,617.80 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$76.0 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt Outstanding** | \$4,000.0 |
| **Net Equity Value** | **\$1,693.80 Million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 159.05 Million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$10.65** |

***

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Calculated Fair Value | Current Market Context (Illustrative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DAR)** | **\$10.65** | Market Price (Example: \$40.00 - Placeholder for justification) |

The calculated fair value of **\$10.65** per share is significantly lower than the current market price (which, for the purpose of a theoretical comparison to justify the assumptions, is typically around the \$40-\$50 range for DAR).

### Justification for the Difference

The market is making significantly more optimistic assumptions about Darling Ingredients' future earnings power, specifically related to the high-growth, high-margin Fuel Ingredients segment, which forms the majority of the valuation difference.

| My Conservative Assumption | Market Assumption (Implied) | Impact on Valuation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin: 5.5% (Flat)** | **Net Income Margin: 9% - 12% (Expanding)** | My valuation assumes a modest rebound from a poor year, while the market is likely pricing in a return to historical high-margin performance seen during peak renewable diesel cycles (2022-2023) and substantial future margin accretion from the new SAF business and lower interest expense via aggressive debt reduction. |
| **Revenue Growth: Declining CAGR (5.0% -> 1.0%)** | **Revenue/EBITDA Growth: Higher, Sustained Growth (5%+ CAGR)** | The market is likely modeling a higher sustained growth rate due to the long-term, high-growth nature of the **Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)** market and the company's leading position as a feedstock supplier. The company's recent CapEx on SAF implies a large capacity addition that will fuel higher revenue growth for longer than my conservative 1% terminal growth. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g): 1.5%** | **Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% - 3.0%** | The market's high valuation is highly sensitive to the Terminal Value. A slightly higher terminal growth rate dramatically increases the NPV. A major, global, "circular economy" play like DAR is likely being given a higher terminal growth assumption than my conservative 1.5% (e.g., closer to long-term global economic growth of 3%). |

**Conclusion:**

My valuation is purely conservative, strictly adhering to the mandated low growth and margin assumptions. The difference between the calculated fair value of **\$10.65** and the market price can be justified by the market's much more aggressive expectation of Darling Ingredients realizing high-margin, stable cash flows from its strategic position in the rapidly expanding **Renewable Diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)** markets, specifically the full realization of policy benefits like the 45Z credit, which would substantially increase the Net Income margin and justify a much higher valuation. My model is a floor value based on minimal future margin and growth expansion.
