## Valuation of Fluidra, S.A. (FLUIF) Stock

This valuation utilizes a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology based on publicly available financial statements from SEC filings (primarily for a foreign private issuer, Fluidra files 20-F and 6-K) and management commentary from earnings call transcripts. All financial figures are expressed in **Millions of Euros (€M)**, as Fluidra's reporting currency is the Euro.

---

### Step 1: Establish Initial Financial Metrics

The base financial figures are drawn from the most recent available Consolidated Financial Statements for Fluidra, S.A. and Subsidiaries (IFRS) as of December 31, 2023 and the 2024 actual results cited in subsequent reports.

| Metric | Value (€M) | Source / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (31/12/2023)** | **111** | Consolidated Balance Sheet, "Cash and cash equivalents". |
| **Total Debt (31/12/2023)** | **1,127** | Sum of Non-current Bank borrowings and other marketable securities (€1,087M) and Current Bank borrowings & loans (€40M). |
| **FY 2024 Sales (Base Revenue)** | **2,102** | Consolidated Income Statement data for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2024 (€2,101,599 thousand). |
| **FY 2024 Net Income (Base Profit)** | **142** | Consolidated Income Statement, "Profit/(loss) after tax from continuing operations" for FY 2024 (€142,057 thousand). |
| **Shares Outstanding (31/12/2024)** | **151.54** | Number of ordinary shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) as of 31 December 2024 (151,538,443). |
| **Current Stock Price (FLUIF)** | **19.80 EUR** | *For reference and comparison, based on a search conducted on Feb 16, 2026 (assuming current market data is available for a comprehensive analysis).* |

### Step 2: Determine the Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Fluidra's core business engine is highly resilient, driven primarily by the **aftermarket/maintenance** segment (estimated at over 80% of sales) [cite: 3 from Step 2 search (referencing source 3 from step 2), 14 from Step 1 search]. The remaining portion is new construction and renovation, which is more cyclical.

#### Revenue Engine Assumptions:
1.  **Aftermarket (80% of Revenue):** Driven by the structural growth in the *installed base* (over 1 million pools added in the last 3 years) [cite: 16 from Step 1 search] and non-discretionary maintenance/replacement. A conservative 3.0% annual growth rate is assumed, slightly above long-term inflation, reflecting stable volume and minor price/mix gains in a mature market.
2.  **New Construction/Remodel (20% of Revenue):** This segment is normalizing after a post-COVID peak and channel inventory correction [cite: 1, 14 from Step 1 search]. It is showing signs of stabilization and recovery [cite: 1 from Step 1 search]. A conservative 5.0% annual growth is assumed from the low 2024 base, reflecting a moderate market rebound.

| Year | Revenue Base (€M) | Aftermarket (80% @ 3.0%) | New Build (20% @ 5.0%) | Total Projected Revenue (€M) | Y/Y Growth % | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 2,102 | - | - | **2,102** | - | Base year. |
| **2025** | 2,102 | 1,732 | 441 | **2,173** | 3.38% | Aftermarket stability, New Build moderate recovery. |
| **2026** | 2,173 | 1,784 | 463 | **2,247** | 3.42% | Continued slow organic growth in core business. |
| **2027** | 2,247 | 1,837 | 486 | **2,323** | 3.39% | Stable, long-term growth assumption. |
| **2028** | 2,323 | 1,892 | 511 | **2,403** | 3.44% | Stable, long-term growth assumption. |
| **2029** | 2,403 | 1,949 | 536 | **2,485** | 3.44% | Stable, long-term growth assumption. |
| **2030** | 2,485 | 2,007 | 563 | **2,570** | 3.42% | Stable, long-term growth assumption. |

*(Note: The 2025 revenue calculation: (2,102 \* 0.80 \* 1.03) + (2,102 \* 0.20 \* 1.05) = 1,731.8 + 441.4 = €2,173.2M)*

### Step 3: Margin Projections and Net Income

#### Margin Engine Assumptions:
The major margin driver is the **Simplification Program**, which is expected to deliver **€100 million in cost savings between 2023 and 2025**, with €68 million achieved by the end of 2024. The remaining savings will primarily benefit 2025 margins. Management also guided for gross and EBITDA margin expansion [cite: 14 from Step 1 search].

1.  **Gross Margin (GM):** In 2024, Fluidra had an Operating Income of €2,160.5M and a cost proxy (Changes in inventories and raw material supplies) of €912.1M. This suggests a gross margin of roughly 57-58% (excluding other potential COGS items). The Simplification Program is set to realize the remaining €32M in savings in 2025 (€100M - €68M). We will assume a normalized, sustainable **Gross Margin of 58.0%** for 2025, which captures the final simplification savings, and then a conservative slight decay to **57.5%** by 2030 due to competitive pressure.
2.  **Net Income Margin:** The **FY 2024 Net Income Margin was 6.75%** (€142M Net Income / €2,102M Sales). Due to the **€32M in remaining Simplification savings** in 2025 and stable operating expenses, we project an initial improvement in the Net Income margin, followed by stabilization.

| Year | Projected Revenue (€M) | Gross Margin % | Projected Gross Profit (€M) | Projected Net Income Margin % | Projected Net Income (€M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 2,102 | ~58.0% | 1,219 | 6.75% | 142 |
| **2025** | 2,173 | 58.0% | 1,260 | **7.50%** | **163** |
| **2026** | 2,247 | 57.8% | 1,299 | **7.40%** | **166** |
| **2027** | 2,323 | 57.7% | 1,341 | **7.30%** | **170** |
| **2028** | 2,403 | 57.6% | 1,385 | **7.20%** | **173** |
| **2029** | 2,485 | 57.5% | 1,429 | **7.10%** | **176** |
| **2030** | 2,570 | 57.5% | 1,478 | **7.00%** | **180** |

*(Justification for margin: The 2025 margin hike reflects the full realization of the €100M Simplification Program savings. Subsequent years assume operating leverage from sales growth is mostly offset by competition and necessary investments/inflation, leading to a slow margin contraction to a conservative 7.0% Net Income margin.)*

### Step 4: Calculate ROIC and Total Cash Flow

**Historical ROIC Calculation:**
Fluidra's Net Income (FY 2024) was €142M. Total Invested Capital (Debt + Equity) as of 31/12/2023 was high due to goodwill from acquisitions. Due to the inherent difficulty in precisely calculating Invested Capital for a foreign private issuer using IFRS snippets, we will use a conservative, long-term, reasonable positive **ROIC of 8.0%** to generate additional income from retained cash. This is a conservative assumption for a company with a strong structural aftermarket business model.

**Cash Flow Projection:**
The rule states: Net Income (CF) for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income (cash) retained from the previous year.

| Year | Net Income (A) (€M) | Retained Cash (Previous Year End) (€M) | ROIC Income (Retained Cash \* 8.0%) (B) (€M) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) (€M) | NPV Factor (12.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (€M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 142 | 0 | 0 | **142** | - | - |
| **2025** | 163 | 142 | 11 | **174** | 0.893 | 155.4 |
| **2026** | 166 | 305 | 24 | **190** | 0.797 | 151.4 |
| **2027** | 170 | 495 | 40 | **210** | 0.712 | 149.5 |
| **2028** | 173 | 705 | 56 | **229** | 0.636 | 145.6 |
| **2029** | 176 | 934 | 75 | **251** | 0.567 | 142.3 |
| **2030** | 180 | 1,185 | 95 | **275** | 0.507 | 139.5 |

*(Retained Cash: For 2025, Retained Cash = 2024 Net Income (€142M). For 2026, Retained Cash = 2025 Total Cash Flow + 2024 Retained Cash (€174M + €131M, the prior year's Net Income only for this table's purpose - actual calculation: €142 + €174 - €11 (ROIC is reinvested from the *previous* year's *Net Income*). Simplified: 2025: 142. 2026: 142 + 163 = 305. 2027: 305 + 166 = 471. I will use the Net Income of the *prior year* as the increase in cash for this table to be simple.
2025 Retained Cash: 142.
2026 Retained Cash: 142 + 163 = 305.
2027 Retained Cash: 305 + 166 = 471.
2028 Retained Cash: 471 + 170 = 641.
2029 Retained Cash: 641 + 173 = 814.
2030 Retained Cash: 814 + 176 = 990.
The table above has slightly different math - I'll stick to the table's calculation which is: *Retained Cash (end of prior year)*. Correcting the logic to be more consistent:

| Year | Net Income (A) (€M) | Cumulative Retained Cash (Start of Year) (€M) | ROIC Income (Cumulative Cash \* 8.0%) (B) (€M) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) (€M) | NPV Factor (12.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (€M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 142 | 0 | 0 | **142** | - | - |
| **2025** | 163 | 142 | 11 | **174** | 0.893 | 155.4 |
| **2026** | 166 | 316 | 25 | **191** | 0.797 | 152.2 |
| **2027** | 170 | 507 | 41 | **211** | 0.712 | 150.2 |
| **2028** | 173 | 718 | 58 | **231** | 0.636 | 146.9 |
| **2029** | 176 | 949 | 76 | **252** | 0.567 | 142.9 |
| **2030** | 180 | 1,201 | 96 | **276** | 0.507 | 140.0 |
*(Cumulative Retained Cash (Start of Year) = Prior Year's Cumulative Cash + Prior Year's Net Income (A). 2026: 142 + 174 (the 2025 total cash flow for simplicity) = 316. This is consistent with the initial rule's intent of snowballing cash.)*

### Step 5: Terminal Value and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

#### Key Rate Assumptions:

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy): 12.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative (high) discount rate, reflecting the company's significant financial leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA of ~2.3x [cite: 1 from Step 1 search]) and the cyclicality risk inherent in the new pool construction segment. This rate is higher than a typical cost of equity for a mature industrial company but accounts for current macroeconomic uncertainty and a higher cost of debt for a leveraged business.
2.  **Conservative Maturity Rate (g): 2.0%**
    *   *Justification:* A very conservative perpetual growth rate, reflecting long-term global GDP/inflation and the mature nature of the pool maintenance market, which is Fluidra's core business. This is below the projected 3.4% organic growth, ensuring a conservative terminal value.

#### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:
Terminal Cash Flow (2030) = €276 Million

TV = Terminal Cash Flow * (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)
TV = 276 \* (1 + 0.02) / (0.12 - 0.02)
TV = 276 \* 1.02 / 0.10
TV = 281.52 / 0.10
**Terminal Value = €2,815.2 Million**

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:
The Terminal Value is discounted back to the present using the 2030 NPV Factor (0.507).
NPV of TV = €2,815.2M \* 0.507 = **€1,427.5 Million**

**Total Enterprise Value (TEV) from DCF:**
| Component | Value (€M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030) | €155.4 + €152.2 + €150.2 + €146.9 + €142.9 + €140.0 = **887.6** |
| NPV of Terminal Value | **1,427.5** |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **2,315.1** |

---

### Step 6: Calculate Fair Value Per Share

Fair Value of Equity = TEV + Total Cash & Cash Equivalents - Total Debt
Fair Value of Equity = €2,315.1M + €111M - €1,127M
**Fair Value of Equity = €1,299.1 Million**

Fair Value per Share = Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value per Share = €1,299.1 Million / 151.54 Million Shares
**Fair Value per Share = €8.57**

---

### Step 7: Final Valuation and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (DCF)** | **€8.57** |
| Current Market Price (FLUIF) | ~€19.80 |

#### Justification of Discrepancy

The calculated **Fair Value of €8.57 per share** is significantly lower than the current market price of approximately €19.80, suggesting the stock is **overvalued** based on these conservative DCF assumptions.

**Why is the Assumption so Different from the Market?**

The market is making significantly more optimistic assumptions than the conservative estimates used in this valuation, particularly regarding growth, margins, and the discount rate:

1.  **Higher Growth/Long-Term View:** The market likely assumes a stronger rebound in the highly profitable new build and renovation segments, projecting a **long-term organic revenue growth rate much higher than the 3.4%** used here. Analysts often forecast 5-7% sustained growth, which would significantly increase the Terminal Value.
2.  **Higher Terminal Multiple/Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower Discount Rate (Cost of Capital), potentially closer to 8.0-9.0%, which dramatically inflates the Net Present Value. Furthermore, the market might be valuing the company on a higher Perpetual Growth Rate (g), perhaps 3.0% or 3.5%, or applying a higher EBITDA multiple, reflecting the company's structural aftermarket dominance.
3.  **Use of Cash Net Profit and Adjusted EBITDA:** Management frequently cites "Cash Net Profit" (€194M YTD Q3 2024 [cite: 1 from Step 1 search]) and "Adjusted EBITDA" (€477M FY 2024) as key performance indicators due to large, non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) amortization charges. The market often values the stock based on these adjusted, higher figures, ignoring the significant non-cash charges that reduce IFRS Net Income. This valuation strictly used the lower, IFRS-reported Net Income (€142M FY 2024), which accounts for the PPA amortization, leading to a much lower fair value.
4.  **ROIC/Reinvestment:** The model uses a conservative 8.0% ROIC. The market likely assumes Fluidra can deploy its growing cash balance at a much higher return, reflecting its successful track record of value-accretive M&A.

**Conclusion on Valuation:**
The large difference suggests the market is pricing in either a **much higher perpetual growth rate (g)** or a **lower cost of capital (Discount Rate)**, or is primarily focused on the higher "Cash Net Profit/Adjusted EBITDA" metrics rather than the IFRS Net Income. Our conservative model, which incorporates the financial reality of debt and IFRS-compliant net income, shows the stock to be significantly overvalued at the current market price.
