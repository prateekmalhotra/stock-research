## 2. Business Engine and Future Assumptions

The Formula One Group's revenue is driven by three main streams: Race Promotion (Hosting Fees), Media Rights, and Sponsorship/Advertising. The business engine is powered by the long-term, contractual nature of these revenues and the recent high-growth strategy under Liberty Media, now significantly augmented by the **MotoGP (Dorna) acquisition**.

### A. Revenue Engine Assumptions (2025-2030)

| Revenue Driver | Base Value | 2025-2026 Assumption | 2027-2030 Assumption (Tapering) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core F1 Revenue** (LTM $3.87B - US Media Rights) | ~$3.81 Billion | **7.0%** annual growth | Tapers to **5.0%** by 2030 | Driven by contractual escalation in race promotion (e.g., Miami through 2041, Mexico through 2028) and sponsorship deals [cite: 4 in step 2]. The initial 7% reflects momentum, tapering to a conservative 5% for the mature asset. |
| **US Media Rights Uplift** | ~$0.09 Billion (Current) | Jumps to **$0.15 Billion** in 2026 | **5.0%** annual growth (Post-Renewal) | Current deal is $75M-$90M. F1 is seeking $150M-$180M for the post-2025 renewal [cite: 2, 3, 11 in step 3]. A conservative **$150 Million** starting in 2026 is modeled. |
| **MotoGP (Dorna) Revenue** | $0.0 Billion (Pre-Acq) | **$0.28B** (Half-Year 2025), **$0.56B** (Full-Year 2026) | **10.0%** annual growth, tapers to **5.0%** by 2030 | Dorna targets €520M (~$0.56B) for 2025 [cite: 9, 14 in step 3]. The acquisition was finalized July 3, 2025, so half-year revenue is assumed for 2025. Liberty is targeting a $400M US market by 2027 [cite: 9 in step 3], justifying the high initial growth before tapering. |

### B. Margin Assumptions

The new **2026 Concorde Agreement** is signed and is "financially attractive," implying improved long-term operating leverage [cite: 4 in step 2]. However, the MotoGP acquisition introduces initial integration costs and a less profitable asset (Dorna had a loss in 2024) [cite: 14 in step 3].

| Metric | LTM (7.06%) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 7.06% | 7.5% | 8.5% | 9.0% | 9.5% | 10.0% | 10.5% | Conservative start to account for MotoGP integration and initial costs, followed by gradual operating leverage from new F1 media deals and F1's stable cost base (other costs 31% of revenue, SG&A 8% of revenue) [cite: 4 in step 1]. |

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

### A. Net Income Projection (Cash Flow)

The rule states: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

$ROIC = 2.73\%$ (Historical) [cite: 2 in step 2].

| Year | Core F1 Revenue | MotoGP Revenue | Total Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC Return (B) | Total Cash Flow (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LTM** | 3.87 | 0.00 | 3.87 | 7.06% | 0.273 | 0.000 | **0.273** |
| **2025** | 4.07 | 0.28 | **4.35** | 7.5% | 0.326 | 0.007 | **0.333** |
| **2026** | 4.41 | 0.56 | **4.97** | 8.5% | 0.422 | 0.009 | **0.431** |
| **2027** | 4.63 | 0.62 | **5.25** | 9.0% | 0.473 | 0.012 | **0.485** |
| **2028** | 4.86 | 0.65 | **5.51** | 9.5% | 0.523 | 0.013 | **0.536** |
| **2029** | 5.10 | 0.69 | **5.79** | 10.0% | 0.579 | 0.015 | **0.594** |
| **2030** | 5.36 | 0.72 | **6.08** | 10.5% | 0.638 | 0.016 | **0.654** |

***Note on ROIC Return (B):*** *ROIC Return is calculated as (Net Income from Previous Year + Previous Year's ROIC Return) \* 2.73%. For 2025, it is 0.273 \* 2.73% = $0.007B. The total net income for 2025 is $0.326B. The cash balance for the next year is $0.273B (2024 total) + $0.333B (2025 total cash flow).*

### B. Discounted Cash Flow Calculation

**Assumptions:**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** 9.0% (Conservative, reflecting a stable, contractual revenue base with M&A risk)
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** 3.0% (Conservative, in line with long-term global growth/inflation)

| Year | Total Cash Flow | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 0.333 | 0.9174 | 0.306 |
| **2026** | 0.431 | 0.8417 | 0.363 |
| **2027** | 0.485 | 0.7722 | 0.375 |
| **2028** | 0.536 | 0.7084 | 0.380 |
| **2029** | 0.594 | 0.6499 | 0.386 |
| **2030** | 0.654 | 0.5963 | 0.390 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | **$2.20 Billion** |

### C. Terminal Value

The terminal value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows beyond the forecast period (2030) using the Gordon Growth Model:

$TV_{2030} = (CashFlow_{2030} * (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$

$TV_{2030} = (0.654 * (1 + 0.03)) / (0.09 - 0.03) = 0.674 / 0.06 = \$11.23 \text{ Billion}$

Discount the Terminal Value back to present day (2024):

$NPV(\text{TV}) = TV_{2030} * \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$

$NPV(\text{TV}) = \$11.23 \text{ Billion} * 0.5963 = \mathbf{\$6.70 \text{ Billion}}$

### D. Enterprise Value Calculation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | $2.20 Billion |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | $6.70 Billion |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$8.90 Billion** |

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $8.90 Billion |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** (C) | $3.14 Billion |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** (D) | $3.03 Billion |
| **Total Equity Value** (TEV + C - D) | $9.01 Billion |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** (S) | 250.05 Million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$36.03** |

---

## 5. Justification and Market Comparison

### Fair Value per Share: **$36.03**
### Current Market Price (FWONA): **~$89.89**

My conservative DCF model results in a fair value that is **-59.8%** lower than the current market price. This significant difference requires a detailed justification of the assumptions.

### Justification of the Discrepancy

The market is making a vastly more optimistic set of assumptions than my conservative model, which I will now detail:

1.  **Market Assumes an Aggressive Terminal Growth Rate:**
    *   My model uses a conservative 3.0% maturity rate. For the market to justify a nearly **$90** stock price, the implied terminal growth rate would need to be in the range of **5.5% to 6.5%**, assuming the same discount rate and current cash flows. This implies F1 will grow well above global GDP/inflation for the foreseeable future, which is a very aggressive long-term assumption for a mature sporting league.

2.  **Market Assumes a Much Higher Long-Term Margin:**
    *   My model projects Net Income Margin peaking at **10.5%** by 2030, a 50% improvement on LTM 7.06%.
    *   To reach a ~$90 valuation, the market is likely factoring in Net Income Margins of **15% to 20%** by 2030. This assumes massive operating leverage from the new Concorde Agreement and a seamless, highly profitable integration of the MotoGP acquisition, with little long-term increase in team payments or other costs.

3.  **Market is Pricing in a Premium for Unidentified Assets and Synergies:**
    *   The market is likely applying a significant premium for the **Dorna (MotoGP) acquisition** and its future synergies, which my conservative model may be understating. The market is likely fully pricing in the Dorna revenue target of $400M in the US by 2027 and a successful "Drive to Survive" playbook application to MotoGP, leading to a much higher-margin business much sooner than my model assumes.
    *   The market may also be factoring in the value of the **Live Nation (LYV) stake**, which is an attributed asset to the Formula One Group, but not a direct cash generator for the F1 operations. The fair value of the Live Nation investment was **$9.1 billion** as of March 31, 2025 [cite: 4 in step 2].
        *   **If we add the $9.1B Live Nation stake to my Total Equity Value ($9.01B):** $9.01B + $9.1B = $18.11B Equity Value.
        *   **Fair Value per Share (with LYV stake):** $18.11 \text{ Billion} / 250.05 \text{ Million Shares} = \mathbf{\$72.43}$

### Final Conclusion

The stock's current market value of **$89.89** is primarily justified by the market’s implicit valuation of the **$9.1 billion Live Nation stake**. My **$36.03** Fair Value (for the core F1 business) plus the **$72.43** Fair Value (F1 business + Live Nation Stake) still results in a **-19.4%** discount to the current market price.

The remaining difference is attributable to the market's aggressive assumptions on the future growth and profitability of the *core* F1 and MotoGP business: **significantly higher long-term operating margins and a much higher terminal growth rate (5.5%+).** My model remains conservative by assuming a **3.0%** terminal growth rate and modest margin expansion to **10.5%** for the combined entities, which suggests that the market is overpaying for the expected growth of the F1/MotoGP business relative to a conservative DCF.
