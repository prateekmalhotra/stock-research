### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The Formula One Group's business engine has three primary revenue streams: **Race Promotion**, **Media Rights**, and **Sponsorship**. Growth is driven by contractual escalators on multi-year agreements and the fixed/maximized number of races (24). The projection also incorporates the **MotoGP acquisition (Dorna Sports)**, expected to close mid-2025.

**Assumptions & Business Engine Justification:**

1.  **Race Count:** Management has stated a comfortable near-term max of 24 races. I assume 24 races annually for the entire projection period.
2.  **F1 Core Organic Growth (Conservative):**
    *   **Race Promotion:** Contractual escalators for existing races and increasing demand for hosting fees are assumed. Projection uses a conservative **4.0% CAGR** for existing contracts.
    *   **Media Rights:** Multi-year contracts provide revenue stability. The projection uses a conservative **5.0% CAGR**, reflecting the benefit of increasing viewership and the potential for new, more lucrative US/international deals, partially offset by potential fragmentation.
    *   **Sponsorship:** Driven by F1's increasing global popularity. Projection uses a conservative **4.5% CAGR**, lower than the 10% YOY increase seen in 2024, to reflect a cautious long-term view.
3.  **MotoGP Acquisition (Dorna Sports):**
    *   **Contribution:** Assumed to close mid-2025, contributing for 6 months in FY 2025, and a full 12 months from FY 2026 onwards.
    *   **Growth:** MotoGP's revenue is conservatively projected to grow at **4.0% CAGR** from its 2023 Revenue base of $525M, leveraging Liberty's F1 expertise in media, marketing, and the Americas.
4.  **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** Management guides F1 operating CapEx to historically trend at 1% to 2% of total F1 revenue. I will use **1.5% of total revenue** as a conservative, non-FCF factor.

### 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

Net Income is projected based on conservative assumptions for Cost of Revenue (COR) and Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A).

**Margin Assumptions:**

1.  **Team Payments (Major COR):** Management expects incremental operating leverage through the 2025 Concorde Agreement.
    *   F1 Team Payments: Start at **61.5%** of pre-team Adjusted OIBDA in 2024. I assume a slight, conservative leverage improvement of **-0.5% per year** until 2027 (before the 2026 Concorde Agreement details become more significant), then flat at 60.0%.
    *   MotoGP Team Payments: Assumed to be lower than F1, at **55.0%** of pre-team Adjusted OIBDA.
2.  **Other COR (excluding Team Payments):** Assumed to remain constant at **31.0%** of total F1 revenue. Applied to the MotoGP revenue as well.
3.  **SG&A:** Assumed constant at **8.0%** of total revenue, in line with historical averages.
4.  **Tax Rate:** Formula One estimates a cash tax rate in 2025 to be a **low double-digit percent of Adjusted OIBDA, increasing modestly**. I will use a conservative effective tax rate of **20.0%** for the projected years.

### 4. ROIC and Final Net Income Calculation

**Historical Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
Formula One Group is a relatively low-capital-intensive business, resulting in a high ROIC. Based on general figures from the industry and the nature of the business, a reasonable, conservative estimate for long-term sustainable ROIC is required. A search result (not an SEC filing) mentioned a TTM ROIC of 2.59% [cite: 1 (from step 2)]. Given the projected increase in profitability, a conservative, yet positive ROIC of **5.0%** will be used, starting from 2026, as the acquisition and full-year operating leverage start to kick in.

**Net Income Rule:** Net Income\_year N = NI\_P\_year N + ROIC * (Net Income\_year N-1)

| Metric | Base FY 2024 (E) | FY 2025 (E) | FY 2026 (E) | FY 2027 (E) | FY 2028 (E) | FY 2029 (E) | FY 2030 (E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NI (Projected)** | $202$ | $235$ | $318$ | $330$ | $337$ | $346$ | $358$ |
| **ROIC $\times$ Previous NI** | - | - | $12$ | $16$ | $17$ | $17$ | $18$ |
| **Total Net Income (NI)** | **$202** | **$235** | **$330** | **$346** | **$354** | **$363** | **$376** |

*Note: ROIC is applied starting in 2026 (0.05 $\times$ 235 = 11.75 $\approx$ 12).*

### 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

Net Income (NI) is used as a conservative proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) as requested.

**Discount Rate Assumptions (Conservative):**

*   **Discount Rate (r):** A conservative but reasonable rate of **8.0%** is used as a proxy for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), reflecting the stable, defensive, and high-margin nature of a premium sports media asset.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** A very conservative maturity rate of **2.0%** is used, reflecting long-term global GDP growth and the fact that a premium, mature sport cannot grow indefinitely at high rates.

#### DCF Table (Millions USD)

| Year | Projected NI (FCF Proxy) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $235$ | $0.9259$ | $217$ |
| **2026** | $330$ | $0.8573$ | $283$ |
| **2027** | $346$ | $0.7938$ | $275$ |
| **2028** | $354$ | $0.7350$ | $260$ |
| **2029** | $363$ | $0.6806$ | $247$ |
| **2030** | $376$ | $0.6302$ | $237$ |
| **Total NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **$1,519$** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
TV\_2030 = (NI\_2030 $\times$ (1 + g)) / (r - g)
TV\_2030 = ($376 \times (1 + 0.02))$ / $(0.08 - 0.02)$
TV\_2030 = $\$383.52 / 0.06 = \$6,392$ million

**Net Present Value of Terminal Value (NPV\_TV):**
NPV\_TV = TV\_2030 $\times$ Discount Factor\_2030
NPV\_TV = $\$6,392 \times 0.6302 = \$4,028$ million

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
Total NPV = NPV\_Explicit Period + NPV\_TV
Total NPV = $\$1,519 + \$4,028 = \$5,547$ million

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV** | $5,547$ |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents (C)** | $2,600$ |
| **Subtract: Total Attributed Debt (D)** | $2,900$ |
| **Equity Value** | **$5,247$** |
| **Total Shares Outstanding (S)** | $234.91$ |
| **Fair Value per Share (Equity Value / S)** | **$22.33** |

### 7. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value per Share (FWONA): $22.33**

**Current Stock Price (FWONA): $77.72**

#### Justification for the Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **$22.33** is significantly lower than the Current Stock Price of **$77.72**. This massive difference indicates that the market is operating on drastically different assumptions than the conservative DCF model presented.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. Model's Conservative Assumptions:**

| Feature | Model's Conservative Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cash Flow Proxy** | Net Income (Very conservative) | Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is typically much higher than Net Income due to non-cash charges like depreciation/amortization. |
| **Growth Rate (F1 Core)** | **5.0% CAGR** through 2030. | **8-10% CAGR** for core F1, based on the tailwinds of media rights and brand expansion (e.g., Netflix's *Drive to Survive* effect). |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** (Conservative maturity rate). | **3.0% - 4.0%** or higher, assuming Formula 1 is an unreplaceable global sports/media monopoly with decades of runway for new markets (e.g., Africa, Asia) and media/sponsorship contracts. |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **8.0%** (Conservative WACC proxy). | **6.0% - 7.0%**, reflecting the perceived lower risk due to long-term, inflation-linked, highly-contracted revenue streams (over \$12 billion in future contracts) [cite: 1 (from step 1)]. |
| **MotoGP/Quint** | Minimal organic growth (4.0%) on the acquired assets. | Significant, double-digit growth potential from applying the 'Liberty Media playbook' to MotoGP and leveraging Quint for higher margin experiences. |

**Primary Reason for Discrepancy:**

The most significant factors are the use of **Net Income as a proxy for FCF** and the **Terminal Growth Rate** used in the model.

1.  **Net Income vs. FCF:** The Formula One Group has high non-cash amortization expense related to the commercial rights acquisition. **Net Income is severely penalizing the valuation** compared to an FCF model. In an FCF model, this amortization is added back, drastically increasing the FCF and, consequently, the Equity Value.
2.  **Market Hype/Scarcity Value:** The market assigns a significant **scarcity premium** to F1 as a globally dominant, irreplaceable, and non-cyclical sports monopoly. This premium justifies a higher multiple and, therefore, a much higher intrinsic value in the market's eyes.

To match the current market price, the market is likely using an FCF model with a higher Terminal Value assumption, which, with F1's stable, contracted revenue, disproportionately increases the NPV. **The market is valuing FWONA as a global media rights monopoly with cash flow stability and a significant scarcity premium, far exceeding the value implied by my conservative Net Income DCF model.**
