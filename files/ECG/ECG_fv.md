## **Part 2: Business Engine & Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)**

### **Business Engine Analysis**

ECG's business is fundamentally driven by **specialty contracting services** across two segments:
1.  **Electrical & Mechanical (E&M):** Driven by high-growth, high-value markets.
2.  **Transmission & Distribution (T&D):** Driven by steady, government/utility-backed infrastructure spending.

The core revenue engine is the conversion of its **Backlog** into revenue, supplemented by new project wins. The key drivers are:

*   **Secular Growth Tailwind:** The E&M segment, the largest portion of revenue (approx. 71% in 2024), is experiencing explosive growth, particularly in the **Data Center/Cloud/AI submarket**. This is cited multiple times by management as a key driver.
*   **Infrastructure Spending:** The T&D segment benefits from national trends in **utility grid modernization, undergrounding, and high-tech reshoring**.
*   **Backlog Visibility:** As of Q2 2025, the backlog stood at **\$3.0 billion** (up 24% YoY), which is a significant multiple of the trailing 12-month revenue and gives management high visibility into future revenue.
*   **Efficiency:** The strategic focus on **off-site manufacturing and prefabrication** is expected to bolster its competitive edge and operational efficiency, leading to margin resilience.

### **Revenue Assumptions and Projections**

The valuation will be conservative by using the low end of management's guidance and then moderating the high growth rates, assuming increased competition and a natural slowing of growth for a larger company.

| Year | Revenue Projection (Millions) | Justification/Growth Rate (YoY) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | **\$2,850** | FY 2024 Revenue (Benchmark). |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | **\$3,300** | **15.8% Growth.** Uses the *low end* of the raised management guidance of \$3.3-\$3.4 billion. This growth is directly supported by the Q2 backlog of \$3.0B and Q1/Q2 2025 performance. |
| **2026** | **\$3,800** | **15.2% Growth.** Assuming continued strong backlog conversion and new wins in the Data Center/Utility market, but a slight moderation from 2025. This is backed by the \$3.0B multi-year backlog, with projects just starting. |
| **2027** | **\$4,294** | **13.0% Growth.** Further moderation as the largest data center build cycle matures, but still high double-digit growth driven by infrastructure tailwinds and strategic M&A (company goal). |
| **2028** | **\$4,723** | **10.0% Growth.** A shift to solid double-digit growth, consistent with a construction leader capturing market share and benefiting from long-term trends (electrification, grid hardening). |
| **2029** | **\$5,195** | **10.0% Growth.** Maintaining a conservative, but high, long-term growth rate for the high-growth E&M and steady T&D segments. |
| **2030** | **\$5,611** | **8.0% Growth.** Final projection year, slowing to a high single-digit rate for conservatism before calculating the terminal value. |

## **Part 3: Net Income Projection and ROIC**

### **Margin Assumptions**

Management noted that 2025 margins would be negatively impacted by approximately **\$28 million** of stand-alone/dis-synergy costs.

*   **Conservative Net Income Margin (2025-2026):** We will project Net Income Margin to be **5.0%** in 2025 (consistent with FY 2024 actual) and 2026, absorbing the temporary stand-up costs. This is conservative as the Q2 2025 Net Income Margin was already 5.7%.
*   **Normalized/Expansion Net Income Margin (2027-2030):** Assuming stand-alone costs are fully absorbed and the focus on high-margin data center work and prefabrication pays off, we project margin expansion to a conservative **5.5%** by 2027 and **6.0%** by 2030.

### **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation**

ROIC is used to project additional income generated from retained earnings (the prior year's Net Income).

*   **Invested Capital (FY 2024):** Total Debt (\$292.5M) + Total Equity (\$514.4M from an external source estimate, which is appropriate for ROIC calculation) = **\$806.9 million** (Using the latest debt and an estimate of equity).
*   **ROIC (Trailing 12 Months):** Net Income (TTM $\sim$\$165.75M) / Invested Capital $(\sim$\$806.9M) $\approx$ **20.5%**.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** We will assume a highly conservative and sustainable **10.0% ROIC** for the valuation, significantly lower than the company's estimated TTM ROIC to account for cyclicality and high capital-intensive nature of the construction business.

### **Net Income Projection**

| Year | Revenue | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) | ROIC on Previous Year's Cash (B) | Total Net Income (A) + (B) | Cumulative Cash/Net Income (to be discounted) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 2,850 | 5.03% | 143.4 | N/A | N/A | 143.4 (Base) |
| **2025** | 3,300 | 5.0% | 165.0 | 14.3 | 179.3 | 322.7 |
| **2026** | 3,800 | 5.0% | 190.0 | 32.3 | 222.3 | 545.0 |
| **2027** | 4,294 | 5.5% | 236.2 | 54.5 | 290.7 | 835.7 |
| **2028** | 4,723 | 5.5% | 259.8 | 83.6 | 343.4 | 1,179.1 |
| **2029** | 5,195 | 5.8% | 301.3 | 117.9 | 419.2 | 1,598.3 |
| **2030** | 5,611 | 6.0% | 336.7 | 159.8 | 496.5 | 2,094.8 |

*   **ROIC on Previous Year's Cash (B):** Calculated as (Cumulative Cash/Net Income from Previous Year * 10.0% ROIC).
*   **Assumption:** Net Income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year.

## **Part 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

### **Discount Rate Assumptions**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC proxy):** **9.5%**. This is a conservative yet reasonable rate for a construction/specialty contractor with high growth (15-20% near term, moderating to 8-10% long term) and a good balance sheet (Net Leverage 0.8x).
*   **Conservative Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate:** **3.0%**. This is a conservative assumption, slightly above long-term inflation/GDP growth, reflecting the company's strong positioning in secularly growing markets (e.g., data centers, utility infrastructure).

### **Terminal Value Calculation (2030)**

The cash flow in 2030 ($\text{CF}_{2030}$) is the Total Net Income projected for 2030: \$496.5 million.

Terminal Value in 2030 ($\text{TV}_{2030}$) = $\text{CF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Growth Rate})$

$\text{TV}_{2030}$ = $\$496.5 \times (1 + 0.03) / (0.095 - 0.03)$
$\text{TV}_{2030}$ = $\$496.5 \times 1.03 / 0.065$
$\text{TV}_{2030}$ = $\mathbf{\$7,858.9}$ **million**

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

The total cash flow to be discounted for each year is the **Total Net Income** for that year.

| Year (t) | Total Net Income ($\text{CF}_t$) | Discount Factor ($\frac{1}{(1 + 0.095)^t}$) | Present Value of Cash Flow (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$179.3 | 0.920 | \$164.9 |
| **2026** | \$222.3 | 0.840 | \$186.7 |
| **2027** | \$290.7 | 0.767 | \$223.7 |
| **2028** | \$343.4 | 0.700 | \$240.4 |
| **2029** | \$419.2 | 0.639 | \$267.9 |
| **2030 (Operating)** | \$496.5 | 0.584 | \$289.5 |
| **2030 (Terminal)** | \$7,858.9 | 0.584 | \$4,588.6 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$5,961.7 million** |

## **Part 5: Fair Value Calculation and Justification**

### **Fair Value of Stock**

| Metric | Value (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$5,961.7 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$292.5) |
| **Add: Initial Cash & Equivalents** | \$64.5 |
| **Implied Equity Value** | **\$5,733.7 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Diluted)** | 51.094 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$112.23** |

### **Fair Value Per Share: \$112.23**

---

## **Part 6: Conclusion and Market Analysis**

**Calculated Fair Value:** **\$112.23 per share**

**Current Market Price:** **\$91.00 per share**

### **Justification for Difference**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$112.23** is approximately **23.3% higher** than the current market price of \$91.00.

The market is making a few conservative assumptions that differ from the base case model, primarily related to:

1.  **Slower Backlog Conversion/Sustainability of High Growth:** The market may be discounting the sustainability of the 15%+ growth rate in 2025 and 2026. While the \$3.0B backlog is strong, a slower conversion cycle due to the complex, multi-year nature of new projects (as mentioned in commentary) may be anticipated by investors.
2.  **Margin Normalization:** The model assumes an ultimate margin expansion to 6.0% net income by 2030, driven by operational efficiencies (pre-fabrication) and the favorable project mix (data centers). The market, observing the initial drag from public company stand-up costs (\$28M) and historical volatility in construction margins, may be baking in a more modest long-term net income margin (e.g., closer to 5.0% - 5.5%).
3.  **Conservative Terminal Value:** A slight downward adjustment in the market's perceived Terminal Growth Rate (e.g., 2.5% instead of 3.0%) or a higher long-term WACC (e.g., 10% instead of 9.5%) could easily bridge this valuation gap.

**Why the Model's Assumption is Justified:**

The model’s higher valuation is justifiable based on the strong, structural tailwinds and management's guidance:

*   **Secular Data Center/AI Demand:** ECG is an established, major player in a market experiencing unprecedented demand (data centers, cloud/AI infrastructure). The long-term nature of this trend, coupled with the company's strong, increasing backlog and strategic focus on prefabrication, justifies the 10.0% conservative ROIC and the 3.0% Terminal Growth Rate.
*   **Strong Financial Position:** The company's low net leverage ratio of **0.8x** as of Q2 2025 is well below its long-term target, providing significant financial flexibility for strategic, accretive M&A, which is a key part of management's strategy and a further growth driver.
*   **Conclusion:** The market appears to be underestimating the long-term, secular demand drivers and the company's ability to maintain a premium growth and margin profile relative to its industry peers, resulting in the calculated fair value being above the current market price.
