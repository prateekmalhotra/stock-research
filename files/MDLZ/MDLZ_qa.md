## Business Summary

Mondelez International operates as a global leader in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector, primarily focused on manufacturing and selling popular snack foods like biscuits, chocolate, and candy. The company's core business model relies on maintaining massive brand recognition—such as Oreo and Cadbury—which encourages consumers to frequently purchase these products, often impulsively. Geographically, Mondelez operates globally, deriving substantial revenue from both developed markets, like Europe and North America, and high-growth emerging economies across Asia and Latin America. The business distributes its products through vast retail networks, including large supermarkets, convenience stores, and increasingly, online channels. The majority of their revenue comes from their high-volume biscuit and chocolate categories, leveraging their strong global portfolio to capture everyday consumer spending.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk for Mondelez involves the volatile cost of essential raw materials, particularly cocoa, sugar, and wheat. If the costs for these ingredients rise sharply, as they have many times in the past, the company must either absorb the extra expense, which lowers profits, or risk losing customers by raising their snack prices. Additionally, high inflation globally poses a threat because customers often reduce impulse purchases or switch to less expensive, store-owned (private label) snack brands, directly harming Mondelez’s sales volumes and market position. Long-term risks center on shifting consumer preferences regarding health and wellness. As governments and consumers increasingly focus on sugar intake and obesity, Mondelez faces pressure to reformulate popular products, which is costly and risky if the new taste is rejected. Historically, some nations have implemented 'sugar taxes,' which raises the final price of the product, severely limiting demand. Failure to adapt to these evolving health trends could significantly harm the company's brand image and future earnings potential.

## Company History

This history lesson will focus on Mondelēz International, Inc. (MDLZ), a company that grew out of a giant food conglomerate to become a global snacking leader.

### **The Inception: A Tale of Two Companies Merged and Separated**

1.  **Early Roots in Cheese and Dairy (1903-1930):** The company’s deep history traces back to James L. Kraft, who started a wholesale cheese business in Chicago in 1903. This business later merged with others, including the National Dairy Products Corporation, to form a massive food company through a series of acquisitions.
2.  **The Rise of a Food Giant:** Over the decades, the merged company, through its various forms like National Dairy and later Kraft, grew by acquiring many famous food brands. A major acquisition was Nabisco, which added iconic snacks like **Oreo** and **Ritz** to its portfolio.
3.  **The Founding of Mondelēz International (2012): The Spin-Off:** The modern company, Mondelēz International, Inc., was formally founded on October 1, 2012, when **Kraft Foods Inc. split into two separate publicly traded companies.**
4.  **Why the Business Was Founded (The Core Goal):** The spin-off was a major strategic decision to create a company entirely focused on the **global snacking market**, which was seen as offering higher growth potential. The goal was to unlock the value of its international chocolate, biscuit, and candy brands.
5.  **The Name's Meaning:** The new name, **Mondelēz**, was chosen by combining two words. "Monde" is a variation of the Latin word for "world," and "delēz" is a creative shortening of the word "delicious," reflecting the company’s vision of creating a "**delicious world**" of snacks.

***

### **The Challenges (Headwinds) Mondelēz Has Faced**

1.  **Navigating Global Uncertainty (Geopolitical Risk):** Because Mondelēz operates in over 150 countries, it constantly deals with geopolitical conflicts and global tensions. These events can disrupt its supply chain, increase manufacturing costs, and complicate selling products in various regions.
2.  **Volatile Ingredient Costs (Commodity Headwinds):** A significant ongoing challenge is the unpredictable price changes for essential raw materials like **cocoa, dairy, and wheat**. These fluctuating commodity prices make it difficult to manage production costs and profit margins.
3.  **Adapting to Changing Consumer Tastes:** The company operates in a competitive industry where consumers are increasingly looking for **healthier snack options**, transparency in ingredients, and less sugar. Mondelēz must constantly adapt its large portfolio to meet these evolving preferences.
4.  **The Complexity of Global Operations (ERP System Issues):** Managing a business of this size requires vast, complex internal computer systems (like Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP). Integrating and updating these systems across many countries can be challenging and costly, sometimes impacting financial results.
5.  **Currency Fluctuations:** Since most of the company's revenue (about 74%) comes from outside the United States, its financial performance is regularly impacted by how the U.S. dollar performs against other world currencies.

***

### **Innovative Solutions and Fortunate Factors (Tailwinds)**

1.  **Strategic Focus on "Power Brands" (Core Tailwind):** The company’s main advantage is its portfolio of **iconic "billion-dollar brands"** like **Oreo, Cadbury, Milka, and Ritz**. Mondelēz focuses its marketing and innovation investments on these popular, high-value names to ensure sustained global growth.
2.  **Geographic Advantage (Emerging Markets Tailwind):** Mondelēz has a massive international footprint, and a large portion of its revenue comes from fast-growing areas known as **emerging markets** (like parts of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa). This exposure to rapidly expanding economies provides a strong tailwind for sales growth.
3.  **"Snacking Made Right" Strategy (Addressing Headwinds):** To address the consumer trend toward healthier choices, Mondelēz launched a strategy focused on **"well-being snacks."** This includes developing new products, reducing sugar content, introducing smaller-portion packs, and ensuring more sustainable sourcing of ingredients.
4.  **Strategic Acquisitions and Innovation:** The company has used strategic buying (acquisitions) to quickly enter new, high-growth categories, such as acquiring premium cookie brands or expanding its baked snacks business in Europe. It also uses a "fast test and learn" approach to innovation, launching new products quicker in smaller markets before scaling them globally.
5.  **Leveraging Digital Technology:** Mondelēz uses technology like **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and advanced data analysis to understand exactly what, where, and why consumers are snacking. This data-driven approach helps them make smarter decisions on product development, pricing, and distribution to remain competitive.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," of Mondelez International (MDLZ) is primarily built on its portfolio of iconic, globally recognized brands and its enormous scale in manufacturing and distribution.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat, differentiation, and growth drivers.

### **The Moat of Mondelez International**

1.  **Iconic, Highly Loyal Brands:** The company owns many iconic, century-old "Power Brands" like *Oreo*, *Cadbury*, *Milka*, and *Ritz*, which are intangible assets that take decades and massive investment to build and maintain. This strong brand recognition creates deep customer loyalty, leading to repeat purchases and giving the products an emotional connection that generic store brands cannot easily replicate.

2.  **Economies of Scale and Cost Advantage:** As one of the world's largest snack companies, Mondelez benefits from massive scale in production, ingredient procurement, and advertising. This allows them to achieve a significant cost advantage over smaller competitors, helping them maintain higher profit margins than the industry average.

3.  **Superior Global Distribution Network:** Mondelez has an extensive and sophisticated global distribution system, including a vast direct-store-delivery network in key markets. This network ensures their products are readily available in over 150 countries, which is a massive logistical and financial barrier for any new entrant to overcome.

---

### **Differentiation and Market Position**

1.  **Special Pricing Power:** Mondelez holds strong pricing power, a core differentiator from competitors. Because their well-loved branded snacks are relatively inexpensive comfort items, demand tends to be less sensitive to price increases than many other products, allowing the company to successfully raise prices to offset rising costs without a significant drop in sales volume.

2.  **Market Leadership in Core Categories:** The company holds dominant #1 and #2 market share positions in its core categories of biscuits and chocolate globally. This position of strength allows them to negotiate favorable terms, including better shelf allocation, with major retail partners worldwide.

3.  **The Advantage of Shelf Space ("Network Effect"):** The company’s large-scale presence, with products on shelves in nearly every retail outlet globally, creates a de facto advantage. The ubiquity of brands like *Oreo* makes them a must-stock item for retailers, which is a strong barrier to entry that acts similarly to a network effect in traditional retail.

---

### **Growth, Stickiness, and Displacement Risk**

1.  **The Reason for Growth:** Mondelez grew into its current form by inheriting a portfolio of world-class brands from the split of Kraft Foods in 2012, and then strengthening its focus exclusively on the high-growth global snacking market. The growth driver has been a clear strategy of extending these iconic brands globally, particularly into emerging markets, and continuous strategic acquisitions in high-growth areas.

2.  **Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The snack food business is based on high-frequency, recurring purchases, driven by consumer habit and the emotional pull of familiar comfort brands. The deep customer loyalty ensures consumers often choose a trusted *Cadbury* or *Oreo* over a generic alternative.

3.  **Resistance to Displacement by Capital:** It would be extremely difficult for a new competitor, even one with a lot of capital, to displace Mondelez quickly. A new entrant would have to spend billions over decades to build the same level of brand trust, customer habits, manufacturing scale, and global distribution network that Mondelez has accumulated.

---

### **Sustaining the Moat (R&D and Innovation)**

1.  **Investment in R&D and Innovation:** While the company's edge is not purely technological, it does invest significantly in Research & Development (R&D) to keep its products relevant. This includes multi-million dollar investments in state-of-the-art Global Innovation Centers to pioneer new products, packaging, and production processes.

2.  **Innovation is Constant:** The company must constantly innovate to maintain its edge and adapt to new consumer trends. This includes introducing new product forms, flavors (e.g., *Oreo* cakes), and formats (e.g., localized pack sizes for emerging markets), as well as strategically acquiring premium or healthier brands like *Clif Bar* to keep the portfolio modern and aligned with evolving tastes.

3.  **Digital and Marketing Strategy:** Mondelez is proactively securing its future moat by shifting to a "digital-first" strategy, aiming to generate 20% of its revenue from digital commerce by 2030 through a $1 billion investment. They also heavily invest in advertising and marketing to continuously strengthen the intangible value of their core brands.

## Catalyst Analysis

Mondelez International (MDLZ) is a global snacking company. The stock's catalysts are driven by its ability to successfully manage commodity costs, maintain pricing power for its popular brands, and grow in key international markets.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Successful Pricing and Cost Management:** The company continues to implement selective price increases to offset high input costs, which is a major driver of profit growth. Management's strategy is to focus on "strategic pricing" and cost control to improve profitability, particularly in regions like North America.

2.  **Stabilization of Developed Markets:** The stock could see a lift if the current soft consumer demand in the U.S. biscuit category and high-price sensitivity in Europe stabilize or improve faster than expected. Management is actively addressing this by planning operational improvements and strategic price adjustments in North America.

3.  **Potential Relief in Cocoa Prices:** Cocoa prices are a major headwind, but the company remains optimistic about a potential drop with the next crop data. If cocoa prices rapidly decrease, it would significantly boost profit margins and create a favorable stock reaction.

4.  **Strong Capital Return:** A recent increase in the quarterly dividend demonstrates management's confidence in strong cash flow generation and commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 1 Year)

1.  **Emerging Markets-Led Growth:** Continued, robust growth in emerging markets, such as Brazil, India, and Mexico, is a core part of the long-term strategy and a key growth driver. The goal is to capture significant market share as global economies expand.

2.  **Focus on Core Snacking Categories:** Management is strategically focusing its business on its most popular and profitable categories, like biscuits and chocolate, with the long-term goal of generating 90% of revenue from these core areas by 2030. This focus helps streamline operations and concentrate investment on powerhouse brands like Oreo and Cadbury.

3.  **Strategic Brand Investment and Acquisitions:** The company is investing in brands and capabilities for long-term growth and is using strategic partnerships, such as with Lotus Bakeries, to expand its biscuit business into new markets.

4.  **Operational Excellence and Efficiency:** An ongoing, multi-year transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and continued execution of cost savings programs are expected to drive better productivity and margin expansion over the long run.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Mondelez International, Inc.'s (MDLZ) recent proxy statements (DEF 14A), the following points detail the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive & Compensation Analysis (MDLZ)**

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Direct Insider Ownership:** The percentage of MDLZ stock owned by corporate insiders (managers and directors) is relatively low, reported between 0.18% and 0.94% of the total shares outstanding. While "higher is better" for direct alignment, this level is typical for large, widely held public companies.
2.  **High Stock Ownership Requirements:** To enforce an ownership culture, the CEO is required to hold company stock equivalent to **8 times their base salary**, while other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) must hold 4 times their fixed income. This substantial requirement mandates a long-term, personal financial commitment to the stock's value, which strongly aligns with shareholder interests.
3.  **Anti-Hedging/Short-Selling Policy:** The company prohibits executives and directors from engaging in hedging, short-selling, or trading derivative securities related to MDLZ stock. This policy prevents management from making a profit if the stock declines, ensuring their only financial benefit from the stock is through its appreciation (i.e., acting as a true shareholder).

#### **Compensation Structure & Performance Metrics**

4.  **Performance-Based Pay Mix:** The compensation structure for the CEO is heavily weighted toward "at-risk," performance-based pay, with only approximately **10%** being a fixed base salary and **90%** being at-risk (Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentives). This design directly links the majority of executive pay to the achievement of specific financial and stock performance goals.
5.  **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Focus:** The largest component of executive pay is the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) program, which makes up about **72%** of total target compensation and consists of **75% Performance Share Units (PSUs)** and **25% Stock Options**. Stock options only gain value if the stock price rises over the vesting period, reinforcing a long-term focus on stock appreciation.
6.  **LTI Performance Metrics Align with Shareholder Value:** The PSUs vest over a three-year period based on a blend of three key metrics, with a strong focus on shareholder returns:
    *   **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR): 50% weighting**, which directly measures MDLZ's stock performance against its peers.
    *   **Organic Net Revenue Growth (25%)** and **Adjusted EPS Growth (25%)**, which incentivize profitable, sustainable operational growth.
7.  **TSR Payout Safeguard:** A critical safeguard is that the Relative TSR metric's payout is **capped at target** if the company's absolute TSR is negative, even if the company performs well against its peer group. This prevents executives from being overly rewarded when shareholders experience a decline in the stock's value.

### **Conclusion**

Mondelez International's management is **well-incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**. The structure is heavily weighted (90%) toward performance-based and long-term equity awards, which only pay out if the company achieves specific, shareholder-aligned financial and stock performance targets over a multi-year period. Furthermore, the mandatory high stock ownership requirements and the strict anti-hedging policy ensure that a substantial portion of the executives' personal wealth is directly tied to the sustained, long-term appreciation of MDLZ's stock price.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of its price history and technical indicators, here is a summary of the current state of Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) stock.

### Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) Stock Analysis

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low**
    *   The current stock price of $62.67 is approximately **16.16%** above its 52-week low of $53.95.
    *   This places the stock in the middle range of its 52-week trading history, as the 52-week high is $72.70.

2.  **Technical Analysis and "Trading Low" Assessment**
    *   Technically, the stock is not trading at its 52-week low, but is generally showing signs of weakness or a sell signal based on some short-term indicators.
    *   Some analyses indicate a "Strong Sell" or "Sell" signal from key indicators, such as the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) being low at 37.239, suggesting the stock is trading below its 200-day moving average.
    *   However, other technical forecasts are mixed, noting some short and long-term moving average buy signals and that the stock holds a support level at around the $62.63 price.

3.  **Recent Price Drops and Causes**
    *   The stock experienced a significant drop, slumping over **18%** in a recent three-month period.
    *   The primary reason for this decline was the **skyrocketing price of cocoa**, a critical commodity for Mondelez's chocolate and snack products, which has pressured the company's gross profit margins.
    *   Additional headwinds include a decline in volume/mix in key emerging markets due to consumer boycotts of Western brands in certain EMEA markets and volume weaknesses in Mexico.

4.  **Analyst Consensus and Future Outlook**
    *   Despite the recent weakness, the stock holds a consensus rating of **Moderate Buy** or **Strong Buy** from a majority of Wall Street analysts.
    *   The average analyst price target is significantly higher than the current price, indicating an expectation for the stock to recover and move toward its 52-week high.

## Long Thesis

Mondelez’s future looks bright because it controls the global market for highly popular, habit-forming snacks like Oreo and Cadbury. This advantage allows the company to act as a powerful price setter: they can raise product prices to offset increases in ingredient costs (like cocoa) without losing many customers, securing high profits. The company is actively shedding less profitable product lines to focus 90% of its business on these core, high-margin biscuits and chocolate categories. This streamlined approach, combined with massive cost-cutting efforts and operational improvements, will drive profitability. Long-term sales growth is guaranteed by aggressively expanding sales into rapidly growing economies across Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where new middle-class consumers are eager for global snack brands. Management has a strong track record of hitting and raising profit targets, leading to consistent shareholder returns via dividends and stock buybacks.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that consumer loyalty to iconic brands (Oreo, Cadbury) remains high, allowing Mondelez to maintain superior pricing power even amid high inflation and rising ingredient costs. Additionally, the planned operational efficiencies and cost-saving initiatives must successfully translate into higher profit margins over the next few years. Finally, sustained economic expansion in emerging markets must deliver the high sales volume growth needed to offset softer consumer demand experienced in developed markets.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies key holes and faults in the long thesis for Mondelez International (MDLZ) by incorporating current financial realities and market dynamics.

## Bear Case Critique: Flaws in the Mondelez Bull Thesis

The long thesis overestimates the company's pricing power and underestimates the acute impact of commodity inflation, while also glossing over the volatile nature of key growth markets.

### I. Flaws in the "Powerful Price Setter" and "Secure High Profits" Claims

1.  **Pricing Power is Not Absolute (Volume/Mix Decline):** While the company has successfully raised prices, this has come at the expense of unit demand. The organic net revenue growth in recent periods has been primarily driven by pricing, masking a persistent decline in volume/mix (the amount of product sold or consumer-preferred mix) which suggests consumers are buying less or trading down.

2.  **Ingredient Inflation Overwhelms Cost-Cutting:** The core assumption that Mondelez can offset ingredient costs is directly contradicted by management's 2025 guidance. Due to **"unprecedented cocoa cost inflation,"** the company has forecast an approximate **10% decline in adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025**, indicating that current pricing, hedging, and operational efficiencies are insufficient to secure high profits against this massive commodity headwind.

3.  **Growing Private Label Threat Challenges Brand Loyalty:** The thesis assumes consumer loyalty remains high, but private label snacks are aggressively gaining market share, forcing Mondelez to litigate against retailers like Aldi over alleged copycat packaging. The success of cheaper, look-alike alternatives directly erodes the perceived 'premium' moat and superior pricing power of iconic brands like Oreo and Cadbury.

### II. Flaws in the "Guaranteed Long-Term Sales Growth" Claim

4.  **Emerging Market Volatility and Risk are Underscored:** While emerging markets (Asia, Latin America, Africa) show good organic growth overall, these regions carry significant geopolitical, currency, and macroeconomic risks, which are ignored in the bull case's "guaranteed" growth claim. Management has specifically noted "soft" consumer confidence in key growth markets like Brazil, Mexico, and China due to economic uncertainty, and one emerging market region, Latin America, saw a reported net revenue decline in the fourth quarter of 2024.

5.  **Negative Currency Translation:** Global expansion means greater exposure to unfavorable currency fluctuations. In recent periods, "unfavorable currency-related items" have partially offset positive organic net revenue growth, cutting into reported top-line results and highlighting a significant drag on reported growth that is outside of management's operational control.

### III. Flaws in the "Streamlined Approach" and "Management Track Record" Claims

6.  **Operational Efficiencies are Necessary, Not a Differentiator:** While slimming down the portfolio (e.g., shedding gum) and implementing cost-saving measures is prudent, it is largely considered standard practice for CPG companies, not a unique growth driver. The cost savings are merely a defense mechanism to manage inflation, as demonstrated by the fact that even with these efforts, the unprecedented cocoa costs are expected to cause a significant drop in adjusted EPS.

7.  **Future EPS Track Record is in Doubt:** The claim of a "strong track record of hitting and raising profit targets" is challenged by the current outlook for a double-digit decline in adjusted EPS for 2025, which reflects the difficulty of executing the strategy in a hyper-inflationary environment for a core product ingredient like cocoa.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ)

**The belief that Mondelez International is an unstoppable price setter whose profits are insulated by brand loyalty is a dangerous oversimplification of a business facing unprecedented commodity inflation and rising competitive pressure.**

1.  **Commodity Headwind will Crush Near-Term Earnings:** Unprecedented cocoa cost inflation, which is expected to severely hit the chocolate portfolio (30% of revenue), is forecast to cause an approximately **10% decline in adjusted EPS for fiscal 2025**. This demonstrates a severe limit to the company's pricing and hedging power, making the near-term profit outlook significantly negative.

2.  **Pricing Is Driving Volume Loss:** Aggressive price hikes are already causing a negative volume/mix, indicating consumers are resisting by buying fewer items or switching to cheaper alternatives. The need for continuous, substantial price increases risks an "elasticity cliff" where core brand loyalty finally breaks, leading to permanent market share loss to private label and low-cost competitors.

3.  **Emerging Market Growth is Volatile and Currency-Exposed:** The high-growth promise of emerging markets is mitigated by significant volatility, foreign exchange headwinds, and soft consumer confidence in key countries like China and Brazil, leading to unreliable, lumpy top-line growth that is significantly discounted upon translation back to US Dollars.

4.  **Premium Brands Are Under Attack:** The fundamental value proposition of 'iconic' brands is being challenged by discounters leveraging private label products that mimic popular packaging, forcing the company to spend capital on expensive legal battles to defend their trade dress rather than investing fully in organic growth.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive analysis, the primary question has shifted from *what is the bear case* to *how successfully is management mitigating the established bear case risks*. The most significant open items relate to the execution of the management's cost-saving and growth strategies (operational excellence and health adaptation).

Here are the important questions and next steps you should investigate further:

### **I. Critical Unanswered Questions on Operations & Risk Mitigation**

1.  **Operational Excellence (ERP System Impact):**
    *   What is the most recent update on the "multi-year transition to a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system"? Is this transition on schedule, and what is its current financial impact (e.g., one-time costs, temporary disruption to supply chain/reporting)?
    *   *The analysis cites ERP as a long-term catalyst, but large system migrations are notorious for short-term operational disruption, which could worsen current volume/mix issues.*

2.  **The True Cost of 'Snacking Made Right' (Health and Wellness):**
    *   What percentage of MDLZ's total Research & Development (R&D) budget is specifically dedicated to sugar reduction and product reformulation?
    *   What are the recent sales performance and organic net revenue growth numbers for the *well-being/healthier* segment (like Clif Bar, smaller portions) compared to the core indulgent brands (Oreo, Cadbury) to see if this strategy is successfully capturing new growth?

3.  **Pricing Power vs. Volume (The Elasticity Cliff):**
    *   Are analysts or management providing specific data on the "elasticity" of demand—meaning, for every percentage price increase, what is the resulting percentage drop in sales volume—in key categories like European chocolate and US biscuits?
    *   *You know pricing is driving revenue, but volume is declining. The critical point is *at what price* will core brand loyalty (the moat) finally break, leading to permanent trade-down.*

### **II. Deep Dive on Geographic and Competitive Threats**

4.  **Emerging Market Volatility (Geopolitical and Currency):**
    *   Which specific emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, India, Mexico, or specific EMEA countries) are exhibiting the *worst* volume/mix performance, and what are the explicitly stated reasons (e.g., boycotts, political instability, or just soft consumer confidence)?
    *   *The analysis mentions volume declines due to "consumer boycotts" in certain EMEA markets; this specific geopolitical risk needs to be quantified.*

5.  **Private Label Market Share Acceleration:**
    *   Search for recent data (within the last 6-12 months) that quantifies the unit sales growth of private label brands versus MDLZ's brands in key categories like cookies and chocolate in Europe, which is a key developed market for MDLZ.
    *   *The US data is compelling, but a European perspective is critical, as MDLZ's chocolate exposure is higher there.*

### **III. Capital Allocation and Commodity Hedge Effectiveness**

6.  **Cocoa Hedging Strategy and 2026 Outlook:**
    *   What percentage of MDLZ's 2025 and 2026 cocoa needs are currently hedged (locked in at a price)?
    *   What is the specific *reported* 2026 Adjusted EPS growth target or initial guidance?
    *   *The analysis suggests a severe 2025 hit. The speed and certainty of a 2026 profit recovery depend heavily on hedge coverage and management's forward-looking statements.*
