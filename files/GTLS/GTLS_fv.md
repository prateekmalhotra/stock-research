### II. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The revenue engine is built on Chart's strategic position in high-growth, long-cycle energy and industrial markets, its substantial backlog, and management's past guidance on growth and synergy realization.

**Key Business Drivers & Assumptions:**

1.  **Massive Backlog & Order Growth:** The Q3 2025 record orders of \$1.68 billion and remaining performance obligations of over \$6.0 billion provide strong revenue visibility through 2026.
2.  **Megatrends:** The core growth is driven by the global build-out of LNG, the transition to cleaner energy (Hydrogen, Carbon Capture, Use and Storage - CCUS), and industrial demand (Data Centers, Nuclear).
3.  **High-Margin Aftermarket:** The Repair, Service & Leasing (RSL) segment is a high-margin component, accounting for approximately one-third of revenue, which provides stability and margin expansion potential.
4.  **Conservatism:** Despite a 3-year CAGR of over 40%, the growth rate is conservatively tapered after 2026 to reflect market maturity and execution risk.

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** (Actual) | \$4,160.0 | - | Q4 2024 Filings |
| **2025** | \$4,750.0 | 14.2% | Midpoint of management's initial 2025 guidance (\$4.65B - \$4.85B), which was later suspended due to the merger. |
| **2026** | \$5,272.5 | 11.0% | Supported by the \$6.0 Billion+ backlog and record Q3 2025 orders, translating orders to sales. |
| **2027** | \$5,747.0 | 9.0% | Reflects continued strong demand in LNG, Data Centers, and Hydrogen/CCUS, but a conservative taper from the high-growth phase. |
| **2028** | \$6,159.3 | 7.0% | Maturation of major LNG projects; sustained but slower growth from RSL and general industrial markets. |
| **2029** | \$6,467.3 | 5.0% | Approaching long-term growth rate; new energy markets are more mature. |
| **2030** | \$6,661.3 | 3.0% | Conservative growth rate as the business stabilizes after the major build-out cycle. |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

**Margin Assumptions:**

*   **Gross Margin:** Management has a medium-term target of "mid-30s gross margin". Q3 2025 saw a 34.1% Gross Margin. A conservative long-term Gross Margin of **34.0%** is used for all years.
*   **Net Income Margin:** Q3 2025 Adjusted Operating Income Margin was 22.9%. A conservative long-term Net Income Margin of **10.0%** is assumed. This is significantly below the implied adjusted NI margin from Q3 (approx. 17%) to account for high interest expenses, non-cash charges, and general operating conservatism for a capital goods company.
*   **ROIC:** A positive Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **10.0%** is assumed, reflecting the company's strong position in capital-intensive, high-barrier-to-entry markets and its operational improvements from the Howden integration.

#### Projected Net Income Calculation

Net Income (t) = (Revenue (t) \* Net Income Margin) + (Cash from NI (t-1) \* ROIC)

| Year | Revenue (Millions) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (from Revenue) | Cash from NI (Previous Year) | ROIC (10.0%) | Net Income (Total) | Cash from NI (Next Year) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$4,160.0 | 10.0% | \$416.0 | - | - | \$416.0 | \$416.0 |
| **2025** | \$4,750.0 | 10.0% | \$475.0 | \$416.0 | \$41.6 | **\$516.6** | \$516.6 |
| **2026** | \$5,272.5 | 10.0% | \$527.3 | \$516.6 | \$51.7 | **\$579.0** | \$579.0 |
| **2027** | \$5,747.0 | 10.0% | \$574.7 | \$579.0 | \$57.9 | **\$632.6** | \$632.6 |
| **2028** | \$6,159.3 | 10.0% | \$615.9 | \$632.6 | \$63.3 | **\$679.2** | \$679.2 |
| **2029** | \$6,467.3 | 10.0% | \$646.7 | \$679.2 | \$67.9 | **\$714.6** | \$714.6 |
| **2030** | \$6,661.3 | 10.0% | \$666.1 | \$714.6 | \$71.5 | **\$737.6** | \$737.6 |

*Note: For 2024, the \$416M is an estimation based on the assumed 10% Net Income Margin for the sake of the model's starting point, applied to the 2024 actual revenue of $4.16B.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income figures are treated as the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE).

**Valuation Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **9.0%**. This is a conservative yet reasonable rate for a high-beta (volatility) industrial growth company in a high-interest-rate environment.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%**. A very conservative rate for a mature industrial company.

#### NPV of Free Cash Flows (Net Income)

| Year | Cash Flow (FCFE) (Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$516.6 | 0.917 | \$474.0 |
| **2026** | \$579.0 | 0.842 | \$487.8 |
| **2027** | \$632.6 | 0.772 | \$488.4 |
| **2028** | \$679.2 | 0.708 | \$481.0 |
| **2029** | \$714.6 | 0.650 | \$464.4 |
| **2030** | \$737.6 | 0.596 | \$439.7 |
| **Sum of Projected FCF NPV** | - | - | **\$2,835.3** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) = FCF (2030) \* (1 + g) / (Discount Rate - g)
TV = \$737.6 \* (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02)
TV = \$752.35 / 0.07 = **\$10,747.8 Million**

#### Net Present Value of Terminal Value

NPV of TV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Years to Terminal)
NPV of TV = \$10,747.8 / (1.09)^(6)
NPV of TV = \$10,747.8 / 1.677 = **\$6,409.1 Million**

## VI. Final Justification and Market Analysis

**Calculated Fair Value Per Share (DCF): \$133.35**

**Current Market Price (Approximate): $\sim\$200.00$**

**Acquisition Price (Baker Hughes): \$210.00 per Share**

### Discrepancy Justification

The calculated DCF fair value of **\$133.35** is significantly lower than the current market price of $\sim\$200.00$ and the all-cash acquisition price of \$210.00. This massive discrepancy is due to the market's primary assumption: **the acquisition by Baker Hughes will close at \$210.00 per share in cash.**

The DCF valuation performed here is a valuation of *Chart Industries as a stand-alone, going concern* based on fundamental business projections. The market, however, is not pricing GTLS as a stand-alone company, but rather as a *deal spread* for a near-certain corporate action.

#### Why the DCF is Lower than the Acquisition Price:

1.  **Conservative DCF Assumptions:**
    *   **Net Income Margin (10.0%):** This is a very conservative assumption for a company with an Adjusted Operating Margin of nearly 23% in Q3 2025 and significant backlog. A buyer (like Baker Hughes) likely modeled a much higher Net Income Margin over the next 5-10 years based on full synergy realization, cost of capital reduction, and further RSL/aftermarket growth. Baker Hughes sees the value of Chart's technology and market position integrated into its own, which may allow for higher margins than Chart could achieve alone.
    *   **Discount Rate (9.0%):** A 9.0% discount rate is aggressive for a company with such high-visibility growth and market leadership. The buyer's cost of capital and synergy value would lower the effective discount rate for the combined entity, which significantly increases the DCF value.

2.  **Lack of Synergy Value:** The DCF model does not account for the significant operational and financial synergies that Baker Hughes expects to realize from the acquisition. These synergies are a major component of the acquisition value.

3.  **Terminal Value Understatement:** The 2.0% terminal growth rate is a *very conservative* maturity rate. Baker Hughes is buying Chart to participate in the long-term, secular growth of the global energy transition (LNG, Hydrogen, CCUS). The actual long-term strategic value to a large energy conglomerate is likely priced on a higher terminal growth rate for their consolidated business.

**The Market's Assumption:**

The current market price of $\sim\$200.00$ reflects a **95% confidence** that the \$210.00 cash deal will close by mid-2026. The difference of $\sim\$10.00$ is the market's pricing of:
*   The small regulatory risk that the deal may fall apart.
*   The Time Value of Money (TVM) for receiving \$210.00 in mid-2026 instead of today.

**Conclusion:**

The fundamental "Fair Value" of Chart Industries on a stand-alone, going concern basis is **\$133.35** per share. The market price is ignoring this fundamental value because the company is in the process of a confirmed acquisition. The current price is an arbitrage play, reflecting the certainty and imminence of the **\$210.00** acquisition payment.
