## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Projection Assumptions

Eastman Chemical operates an innovation-driven model, transitioning from a commodity-like chemical company to a specialty materials company. The key value drivers (the "business engine") are **innovation-led volume growth** (especially the Circular Economy platform) and **aggressive cost reduction**.

### Management Guidance & Engine Metrics:

1.  **Innovation Growth (Circular Economy):** The Kingsport methanolysis facility (part of the Circular Economy platform) is a significant driver, expected to yield incremental earnings (EBIT) and drive a **4-5% revenue increase in the Advanced Materials segment** in 2026. The company secured key contracts (e.g., rPET) that are already beginning to ramp up.
2.  **Cost Reduction:** Management targeted and achieved $\sim\$100$ million in cost savings in 2025, and is targeting another **\$125 million to \$150 million** in structural cost reduction in 2026. We will use the conservative low-end of **\$125 million** for 2026.
3.  **Macroeconomic Environment:** Management is *not* assuming an economic recovery for 2026 and is basing its planning on a macro environment that is **"relatively stable"** to 2025, with continued weakness in discretionary markets.
4.  **Key Financial Metrics:**
    *   2026 Interest Expense: **\$215 million**
    *   2026 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: **15%**

### Conservative Financial Projections (2026 - 2030)

The base case for all projections assumes that the cost-reduction program drives margin improvement, but overall revenue growth is kept modest to account for continued macro weakness, as guided by management.

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate Assumption | Revenue (Million USD) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (Million USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2025 (Actual)** | N/A | \$8,752 | 5.42% (Actual NI/\$8,752M) **\*1** | \$474 |
| **FY 2026** | **2.0%** (Below AM segment guidance) | **\$8,927** | **8.16%** **\*2** | **\$729** |
| **FY 2027** | **3.0%** (Modest organic recovery & innovation ramp) | **\$9,195** | **8.25%** **\*3** | **\$758** |
| **FY 2028** | **3.0%** | **\$9,471** | **8.50%** **\*3** | **\$805** |
| **FY 2029** | **2.5%** | **\$9,708** | **8.50%** | **\$825** |
| **FY 2030** | **2.0%** (Long-term maturity rate) | **\$9,902** | **8.50%** | **\$842** |

*   **\*1 FY 2025 Net Income:** The TTM Net Income of $\$474M$ is used for the starting point of the DCF.
*   **\*2 FY 2026 Net Income Calculation:**
    *   2025 Adj. EBIT: \$930M
    *   Revenue Growth EBIT Impact: $(\$8,927M - \$8,752M) \times 10.63\%$ (2025 Adj. EBIT Margin) $\approx \$18.6M$
    *   Cost Reduction Impact: $+\$125M$
    *   Estimated 2026 EBIT: $\$930M + \$18.6M + \$125M = \$1,073.6M$
    *   2026 Net Income: $(\$1,073.6M - \$215M \text{ Interest}) \times (1 - 0.15 \text{ Tax Rate}) = \$858.6M \times 0.85 = \mathbf{\$729.8M}$ (Rounded to \$729M)
*   **\*3 Net Income Margin Improvement:** From 2026 to 2028, a gradual margin improvement is projected (8.16% to 8.50%) to reflect the compounding effect of the $>\$225M$ in cost savings and operational leverage from the specialty volume ramp (Circular Economy) which has a high-value product mix. The 8.50% terminal margin is still highly conservative, below the 9.71% GAAP Net Income Margin for 2023.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for each year is treated as the cash flow for the valuation, as per the instruction.

### ROIC & Cash Flow Reinvestment Model

The model assumes all Net Income flows to cash. Cash from the previous year is invested at a conservative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and that return is added to the next year's Net Income.

*   **Conservative ROIC:** **7.0%**. This is a conservative yet positive figure, given the historical TTM ROIC has been near $7.58\%$ to $9.01\%$.

| Year | Beginning Cash (NI from P.Y.) | ROIC (7.0%) on Beginning Cash | Projected NI from Operations | Total Net Income / Cash Flow (CFi) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of CFi |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$474 | \$33.18 | \$729 | **\$762** | 0.9174 | \$699 |
| **2027** | \$762 | \$53.34 | \$758 | **\$811** | 0.8417 | \$683 |
| **2028** | \$811 | \$56.77 | \$805 | **\$862** | 0.7722 | \$665 |
| **2029** | \$862 | \$60.34 | \$825 | **\$885** | 0.7084 | \$627 |
| **2030** | \$885 | \$61.95 | \$842 | **\$904** | 0.6499 | \$588 |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030):** | | | | | | **\$3,262** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

The cash flow for 2030 ($\text{CF}_{2030}$) is used to calculate the Terminal Value ($\text{TV}$) using a conservative perpetuity growth model.

*   **Conservative Maturity (Terminal Growth) Rate ($g$):** $\mathbf{2.0\%}$
*   **Conservative Discount Rate ($r$):** $\mathbf{9.0\%}$

$$\text{TV} = \frac{\text{CF}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{\$904 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02}$$

$$\text{TV} = \frac{\$922.08}{0.07} = \$13,172.57 \text{ Million}$$

### Net Present Value (NPV) of Terminal Value

The Terminal Value is discounted back to the present (end of 2025 is considered year 0, so discounted by 5 years).

$$\text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$13,172.57 \times 0.6499$$

$$\text{NPV of TV} = \mathbf{\$8,561} \text{ Million}$$

### Total Equity Value

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \text{Total NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030)} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \$3,262 + \$8,561 + \$837 - \$5,010$$

$$\text{Total Equity Value} = \mathbf{\$7,650} \text{ Million}$$

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### Fair Value Per Share

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Total Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$7,650 \text{ Million}}{117.65 \text{ Million Shares}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \mathbf{\$65.02}$$

---

### Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Market Data (Approx.) | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$65.02** | **\$68.25** | **-4.73%** |

The calculated Fair Value of **\$65.02** is very close to the market price of \$68.25 (a difference of less than 5%).

**Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions:**

*   **Market Assumption:** The market is implicitly assuming a slightly higher future growth rate, a slightly higher long-term margin, or a lower discount rate than the conservative assumptions used in this DCF. The market value suggests an approximate **\$3.8B** terminal value to equity is expected.
*   **Valuation Justification:** The valuation is highly justified by the direct use of management's conservative commentary from the Q4 2025 earnings call.
    *   **Revenue:** The projection for 2026 uses a very modest 2.0% growth on total revenue, even as the high-growth segment (Advanced Materials - Circular Economy) is guided for 4-5% growth. This conservatively assumes continued weakness in commodity segments (Chemical Intermediates and Fibers) will offset the specialty growth.
    *   **Margins:** The projected Net Income Margin (terminal 8.50%) is conservative, only slightly higher than the 2026 calculation (8.16%), suggesting the cost-cutting and innovation is just enough to counter inflationary and cyclical headwinds, but not enough to reach historical peaks.
    *   **ROIC:** A modest 7.0% ROIC for future cash reinvestment is conservative for a specialty chemicals company focused on high-value products.
    *   **Discount Rate/Terminal Growth:** The $9.0\%$ discount rate and $2.0\%$ terminal growth are conservative choices for an established, investment-grade specialty materials company.

The negligible difference (less than 5%) indicates that the market is largely aligning its expectations with the growth and margin improvement narrative being driven by the circular economy platform and structural cost reduction, but also recognizing the persistent macroeconomic and cyclical headwinds in the broader chemical industry, exactly as outlined by management. The market is giving management credit for its articulated, actionable levers (cost cuts, circular economy) for 2026.
