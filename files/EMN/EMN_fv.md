## Eastman Chemical Company (EMN) Stock Valuation

This valuation is based on a conservative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, projecting cash flows (Net Income is used as a conservative proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity) from 2025 to 2030 and incorporating management's guidance on growth drivers, cost reductions, and market outlook.

All financial data for the base case is drawn from the most recent SEC filings (2024 10-K and 2025 10-Q) as cited in the data-gathering process.

### I. Financial Data from SEC Filings (Base Case)

The following financial figures are used as the starting point for the valuation:

| Metric | Value (Millions of USD) | Source/Period | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $423 | Q2 2025 Update | Conservative figure for cash and short-term investments. |
| **Total Debt** | $5,350 | Q2 2025 Update | Conservative, more recent total debt figure. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 114.782 | Q2 2025 | Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2025. |
| **Last Full Year Revenue (2024)** | $9,382 | Full Year 2024 | Starting point for revenue projections. |
| **Last Full Year Net Income (2024)** | $905 | Full Year 2024 | Starting point for margin analysis. |
| **Historical Net Income Margin (2024)** | 9.65% | $905M / $9,382M | Used for the first-year projection. |
| **Long-Term ROIC (Approximation)** | 8.0% | Conservative Estimate | Used for incremental cash flow generation (see ROIC Justification). |

**ROIC Justification:**
The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for new cash deployment is estimated conservatively at **8.0%**. This is slightly below the approximate 2024 ROIC (NOPAT of $\approx$ $1,038M$ / Invested Capital of $\approx$ $11,260M$ = $\approx$ $9.22\%$) and below what a specialty chemical company in a growth/recovery phase would typically target, adhering to the rule of using a conservative, but reasonable, positive ROIC when projecting positive Net Income.

### II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Eastman Chemical’s business engine is transitioning from a commodity-exposed chemical manufacturer to a **specialty materials and sustainable innovation company**, with a key focus on the **molecular recycling platform**. The core drivers for the next few years are:

1.  **Kingsport Methanolysis Facility Ramp-up:** This facility is expected to be a significant driver of **strong earnings growth** and **increased revenue** starting in 2025.
2.  **Cost Reduction and Cash Generation:** Management is focused on **\$75 million to \$100 million in cost reductions** to mitigate macroeconomic headwinds.
3.  **Market Stabilization and Volume/Mix Recovery:** Management anticipates **market stabilization** and **improved earnings** in 2026 as inventory destocking ends and end markets (automotive, durables) recover from macroeconomic challenges.
4.  **Specialty Focus:** Continued volume/mix growth in the Advanced Materials and Additives & Functional Products segments.

**Revenue Projections (Justification):**

| Year | Growth Rate | Revenue (Millions of USD) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | N/A | $9,382 | Base Year. |
| **2025 (Recovery)** | +2.0% | $9,570 | **Conservative/Stagnation:** Assumes only a slight rebound from the challenging Q2/Q3 2025 environment (mid-single-digit volume decline in Q3 was anticipated [cite: 7 in Step 1]) is offset by the methanolysis ramp-up and initial cost-saving benefits. This is a very modest recovery year. |
| **2026 (Stabilization/Growth)** | +4.5% | $10,001 | **Moderate Growth:** Incorporates management's anticipation of "market stabilization and improved earnings in 2026". This relies on end-market recovery and stronger full-year contribution from the methanolysis facility. |
| **2027** | +5.0% | $10,501 | **Innovation Acceleration:** Assumes the full impact of the first methanolysis facility is realized and the company begins to see early benefits of a "second capital-efficient" facility (mentioned in Q2 2025 commentary) or continued high-value innovation adoption. |
| **2028** | +4.0% | $10,921 | **Sustained Growth:** A more conservative, yet healthy, growth rate for a mature specialty chemical company, reflecting market penetration of new circular products. |
| **2029** | +3.5% | $11,303 | **Maturing Growth:** A slight deceleration as the large one-time investments are fully absorbed, settling toward a long-term specialty chemical growth rate. |
| **2030** | +3.0% | $11,642 | **Pre-Terminal:** Final projection year, approaching the conservative long-term maturity rate. |

### III. Margin Projections and Net Income

**Net Income Margin Justification:**

*   **2025:** Margin is expected to be suppressed due to the inventory reduction actions causing a \$75M-\$100M utilization headwind in the back half of the year. The $905M Net Income for 2024 was a 9.65% margin. I will be conservative and hold the 2025 margin at the 2024 level, assuming the new cost cuts ($75M - $100M) just offset the utilization headwind and lower-priced volume. **(9.65%)**
*   **2026 - 2030:** As the utilization headwind dissipates, the market stabilizes, and the high-margin methanolysis platform fully ramps up, I project a gradual, conservative margin expansion to reflect the company's shift toward being a *specialty* and *sustainable* materials company. I cap the margin at **12.0%** by 2030. This is conservative, as pre-2022 margins were higher, and the shift to high-value circular economy products should allow for significant margin leverage.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B = A * Margin) | Prior NI ROIC ($) (C) | ROIC % | Total Net Income (B + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $9,382 | 9.65% | $905 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **2025** | $9,570 | 9.65% | $923 | N/A | N/A | **$923** |
| **2026** | $10,001 | 10.00% | $1,000 | $923 | 8.0% | $1,000 + ($923 * 0.08) = **$1,074** |
| **2027** | $10,501 | 10.50% | $1,103 | $1,074 | 8.0% | $1,103 + ($1,074 * 0.08) = **$1,189** |
| **2028** | $10,921 | 11.00% | $1,201 | $1,189 | 8.0% | $1,201 + ($1,189 * 0.08) = **$1,296** |
| **2029** | $11,303 | 11.50% | $1,300 | $1,296 | 8.0% | $1,300 + ($1,296 * 0.08) = **$1,404** |
| **2030** | $11,642 | 12.00% | $1,397 | $1,404 | 8.0% | $1,397 + ($1,404 * 0.08) = **$1,510** |

*Note: The net income from the previous year is assumed to go straight to cash and be deployed at the ROIC rate in the next year. The table above shows the *Net Income for the next year* (B) + *Additional Income from prior cash deployment* (C).*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

**Discount Rate & Maturity Rate Justification:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy): 10.0%**
    *   This is a conservative (high) discount rate for a stable, investment-grade specialty chemical company. It represents a high hurdle rate, building in a safety margin.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate): 1.5%**
    *   This is a very conservative growth rate, significantly below the projected 3.0% growth in 2030. It is a reasonable, long-term rate for a mature chemical company, slightly above the long-term US inflation forecast, adhering to the "very conservative maturity rate" rule.

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $923 | 0.909 | $839 |
| **2026** | $1,074 | 0.826 | $887 |
| **2027** | $1,189 | 0.751 | $893 |
| **2028** | $1,296 | 0.683 | $885 |
| **2029** | $1,404 | 0.621 | $872 |
| **2030** | $1,510 | 0.564 | $852 |
| **Sum of NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **$5,228** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030):**

*   Terminal Cash Flow (2031) = 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate)
    *   $1,510 M * (1 + 0.015) = $1,532.65 million
*   Terminal Value (2030) = Terminal Cash Flow / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    *   $1,532.65 M / (0.10 - 0.015) = $18,031.18 million
*   NPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value (2030) * Discount Factor (2030)
    *   $18,031.18 M * 0.564 = **$10,165 million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV):**

*   NPV of Projected Cash Flows ($5,228 M) + NPV of Terminal Value ($10,165 M) = **$15,393 million**

| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $423 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $5,350 |
| **Equity Value** | **$10,466** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $114.782$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$91.18** |

### VI. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (DCF)** | **$91.18** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **$63.47** (As of the last closing price mentioned in the search data) [cite: 13 in Step 1, Note: Assuming this is the current price for comparison] |

**Market Discrepancy Justification:**

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share of \$91.18** is significantly higher (approximately 44% higher) than the current market price of $\approx$ \$63.47. This large discrepancy suggests the market is making more pessimistic assumptions than those used in this conservative DCF model.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. DCF Assumptions:**

| DCF Assumption (Optimistic but Management-Guided) | Market's Implicit Assumption (Pessimistic) | Why the difference? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Future Margin:** Gradually improves from 9.65% to a conservative 12.0% by 2030, driven by the shift to high-margin specialty/circular products. | **Future Margin:** Margins will remain at the low-to-mid single-digit level (9-10%), stuck in the cyclicality of the Chemical Intermediates segment, and the new specialty projects (like methanolysis) will face significant execution risk or margin compression. | The market is skeptical that the methanolysis facility will reach its earnings potential as fast as management predicts, or it fears the next facility may be delayed or cancelled, leading to sustained low-cycle margins. |
| **Revenue Growth:** Ramps from 2.0% (2025) to 5.0% (2027) before moderating, driven by market stabilization and new specialty capacity. | **Revenue Growth:** Volume growth will be flat or near-zero for multiple years due to continued global macroeconomic weakness, geopolitical tariff risks, and oversupply in certain chemical markets. | Persistent trade tensions and the ongoing global industrial slowdown are weighing heavily on the stock, leading to a focus on the short-term negative volume/utilization headwinds rather than the long-term growth story [cite: 7 in Step 1]. |
| **ROIC/Reinvestment:** All cash is reinvested at a positive **8.0%** ROIC. | **ROIC/Reinvestment:** The company will continue to deploy capital at low or negative returns (which has been the case for some commodity-exposed chemical firms during downturns), or excess cash will be used for debt service and slow-growth dividends instead of high-ROIC internal projects. | The market is demanding a higher risk premium (implied in the lower price) because EMN’s core segments are tied to cyclical industries, making the stability of the high-margin specialty business suspect during a downturn. |

**Justification for DCF Value:**
The DCF value of **\$91.18** represents the *long-term value* of Eastman Chemical as a specialty chemical company successfully executing its transition and innovation strategy (molecular recycling). The current market price of $\approx$ \$63.47 is pricing the stock as if the company were still largely a commodity-cyclical player *that will fail to capture the full, high-margin value of its innovation investments*.

**The fair value is justified because it is fundamentally backed by the management's own commentary and plans:**
1.  **\$75M - \$100M cost reduction** is a real-dollar impact that should drive higher margins [cite: 7 in Step 1].
2.  **Methanolysis ramp-up** is a high-value, differentiated product that is already setting production records and should provide a material earnings uplift in 2026/2027.
3.  The valuation uses a **conservative 10.0% discount rate** and a **very conservative 1.5% terminal growth rate**, suggesting the final valuation is robust even against cautious macro expectations.
