## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection (2025 - 2030)

Scholastic's business engine is driven by its irreplaceable access to schools through **Book Fairs** and **Book Clubs** (Children's Book Group), complemented by high-value, durable **Intellectual Property (IP)** (Dog Man, Harry Potter, Hunger Games) and the expansion of its **Entertainment** (9 Story Media Group) and **International** segments. The main drag is the volatile **Education Solutions** segment.

### Business Engine Assumptions

| Segment | Driver & Management Commentary | Conservative Growth Rate Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Children's Book Publishing & Distribution (CBPD)** | Strong IP cycle (new *Dog Man* and *Hunger Games* releases). Fall Book Fair bookings are encouraging. New integrated **Children's Book Group** expected to drive efficiencies and long-term growth. | **3.0%** (FY2027-2028), **2.5%** (FY2029-2030) |
| **Education Solutions** | Significant headwinds in supplemental curriculum (28% decline in Q1 FY2026) due to volatile federal/state funding. Company is "repositioning" for long-term growth. | **-5.0%** (FY2027-2028: Assume continued pressure and a slow turnaround), **1.0%** (FY2029-2030: Assume modest rebound after repositioning) |
| **Entertainment** | Acquisition of **9 Story Media Group** for 360-degree IP strategy (digital/streaming/licensing). Management targets high-margin digital/licensing revenue streams. | **10.0%** (FY2027-2029: Driven by IP monetization), **8.0%** (FY2030: Growth moderates) |
| **International** | Steady growth (4% in Q1 FY2026) in key markets (Australia, U.K., Asia) and operational efficiencies. | **4.0%** (FY2027-2030: Modest, steady global expansion) |

### Revenue Projection Table

The starting point for **FY2025 (Actual)** is $1,625.5 million. The **FY2026 (Projected)** revenue is a **3.0%** increase on FY2025, per management's midpoint guidance ($1,625.5 * 1.03 = $1,674.3M).

| Year (Fiscal Year Ending May 31) | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 | FY2028 | FY2029 | FY2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth Rate** | 2.3% | **3.0%** (Guidance) | 3.0% | 3.0% | 2.5% | 2.5% |
| **Total Revenue** | **1,625.5** | **1,674.3** | **1,724.5** | **1,776.2** | **1,820.6** | **1,866.1** |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projection

The valuation will use Net Income as a proxy for Cash Flow to Equity, as per the rules.

### Margin Assumptions

1.  **FY2026 Net Income Margin:** Calculate a target Net Income based on the Adj. EBITDA guidance to establish a conservative baseline for profitability.
    *   *Adj. EBITDA (Midpoint)*: $165.0 million.
    *   *Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):* Assuming a conservative $50M - $60M, based on past filings (non-search data). Using **$55.0M**.
    *   *Interest Expense (Net):* Assuming modest expense given net debt position and average interest rates. Using **$10.0M**.
    *   *Tax Rate:* Scholastic is often close to zero tax due to tax credits/losses but we will use a conservative **21%** statutory rate for long-term taxable income.

    *   *Adj. Operating Income (EBIT):* $165.0 - $55.0 = $110.0
    *   *Pre-Tax Income:* $110.0 - $10.0 = $100.0
    *   *Tax (21%):* $21.0
    *   *Net Income (FY2026 Target):* **$79.0M** (or a 4.7% Net Income Margin).

2.  **Long-Term Margin (FY2027-2030):** Assume the Net Income Margin expands slowly due to cost-saving initiatives, the new Children's Book Group's efficiencies, and the shift to higher-margin digital/licensing revenue in the Entertainment segment. The conservative margin increase is **0.25% per year**.

### ROIC & Net Income Calculation

The rule is: **Net Income for next year = (Net Income from that year based on reasonable assumptions) + (ROIC from net income got from previous year)**. This treats the entire Net Income from the prior year as cash that generates an ROIC-based return in the subsequent year, which is then added to the organic Net Income of that subsequent year.

*   **Historical ROIC (FY2025):** The company had a Net Loss of -$1.9M in FY2025 [cite: 7 (from Step 3)].
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** Given the past volatility and the turn toward profitability, we must select a *conservative but reasonable positive ROIC %*. A conservative, low-growth ROIC for a publishing/media company is **3.0%**.

| Year (FY Ended May 31) | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 | FY2028 | FY2029 | FY2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | 1,625.5 | 1,674.3 | 1,724.5 | 1,776.2 | 1,820.6 | 1,866.1 |
| **Net Income Margin** | -0.1% | 4.7% | 4.95% | 5.20% | 5.45% | 5.70% |
| **A: Organic Net Income (NI)** | -1.9 | **79.0** | 85.3 | 92.4 | 99.2 | 106.4 |
| **B: ROIC from Prior NI** | N/A | $0.0 ($0 NI from FY25 to be conservative) | 2.4 | 2.6 | 2.8 | 3.0 |
| **Total Net Income (A+B)** | **-1.9** | **79.0** | **87.7** | **95.0** | **102.0** | **109.4** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### DCF Assumptions

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a WACC of **8.0%**. This is a reasonable but conservative rate for a mature company with low-to-moderate growth expectations in a stable, established industry.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** We will use a long-term growth rate of **1.0%**. This assumes that Scholastic's growth will eventually stabilize below the long-term GDP growth rate, reflecting the conservative nature of the publishing industry.
*   **Terminal Year Cash Flow:** We will use the FY2030 *Total Net Income* as the final cash flow for the terminal value calculation.

### Present Value Calculation

| Year (n) | FY (End of Year) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) (A+B) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 8.0%)^n) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2026 | $79.0 | 0.9259 | $73.15 |
| 2 | 2027 | $87.7 | 0.8573 | $75.28 |
| 3 | 2028 | $95.0 | 0.7938 | $75.40 |
| 4 | 2029 | $102.0 | 0.7350 | $74.97 |
| 5 | 2030 | $109.4 | 0.6806 | $74.46 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026-2030)** | | | | **$373.26** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of End of FY2030)

$$
\text{Terminal Value (TV)} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{\text{FY2030}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}}
$$

$$
\text{TV} = \frac{\$109.4 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.08 - 0.01} = \frac{\$110.5}{0.07} = \$1,578.57 \text{ million}
$$

### Terminal Value Net Present Value

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \text{TV} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{Year 5}}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of TV} = \$1,578.57 \times 0.6806 = \$1,074.37 \text{ million}
$$

### Net Present Value of Firm

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \text{Sum of NPV (2026-2030)} + \text{NPV of TV}
$$

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \$373.26 + \$1,074.37 = \mathbf{\$1,447.63} \text{ million}
$$

***

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Current Cash} - \text{Total Debt}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$1,447.63 + \$94.3 - \$345.9 = \mathbf{\$1,196.03} \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}
$$

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$1,196.03 \text{ million}}{25.14 \text{ million shares}} = \mathbf{\$47.57} \text{ per share}
$$

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share (SCHL)** | **$47.57** |
| **Current Market Price (SCHL)** | **$29.24** [cite: 2, 4 (from Step 4)] |
| **Valuation Discrepancy** | **62.7% higher** |

### Justification for Discrepancy

My fair value of **$47.57** is significantly higher (62.7%) than the current market price of $29.24. This large discrepancy suggests the market is making much more conservative assumptions about the company's future profitability and growth than my model, which is already built on conservative principles.

**Why the Market is Conservative (The Bear Case):**

1.  **Education Solutions Headwinds:** The market is heavily discounting the value due to the $41.4 million revenue decline in the Education Solutions segment in FY2025 [cite: 7 (from Step 3)] and the further 28% decline in Q1 FY2026 [cite: 5 (from Step 3)]. This segment is seen as a black box of uncertainty due to volatile federal and state funding, and the market likely projects a *deeper, longer-term decay* for this segment than my modest rebound assumption.
2.  **IP Cyclicality:** Scholastic's success is tied to mega-franchise releases (e.g., *Dog Man*, *Hunger Games*). The market may not believe the company can consistently replace the revenue from these massive, cyclical hits, assigning a lower multiple to the core publishing business. The market views the $79.0M Net Income target for FY2026 as an *aberration* driven by the *Sunrise on the Reaping* and new *Dog Man* releases.
3.  **Real Estate Uncertainty:** While the potential sale-leaseback of real estate (SoHo headquarters, Jefferson City distribution center) is an upside, the market may be waiting for the *guaranteed* realization of this cash before incorporating it into the valuation.
4.  **Low Historical Profitability:** FY2025 saw a net loss of $1.9M [cite: 7 (from Step 3)]. The market is hesitant to trust the projected FY2026 profitability (4.7% Net Income Margin) and the long-term margin expansion, pricing the stock based on its *historic* near-zero margins, not its *projected* margins.

**Why My Assumption is Different (The Bull/Justified Case):**

1.  **Management Guidance as Truth:** My model *must* use management's guidance as truth. The company is guiding to **$160M - $170M Adjusted EBITDA** and **2% - 4% revenue growth** for FY2026 [cite: 1, 2 (from Step 3)], which translates to robust profitability ($79.0M Net Income). The market is effectively stating management's guidance is unachievable.
2.  **360-Degree IP Monetization:** My model gives credit to the higher-margin digital/licensing revenue from the **Entertainment** segment (9 Story Media Group) and the new streaming app, which is a strategic shift to a less-asset-heavy, high-margin model [cite: 5, 8 (from Step 3)]. The market is undervaluing this transformation.
3.  **Conservative DCF Inputs:** The DCF uses a conservative WACC of 8.0% and an extremely conservative terminal growth rate of 1.0%. If Scholastic simply maintains a 4.7% Net Income margin and grows at 3% a year after 2030, the value would be even higher. The current valuation suggests the market is pricing in either a near-zero growth rate or a significant long-term decline in profitability.

**Conclusion:** The market is pricing SCHL as a cyclical, low-growth, low-margin publisher facing a secular decline in its Education business. My model, based on management's confirmed FY2026 profitability guidance and the new, higher-margin **360-degree IP strategy** (Entertainment and Children's Book Group integration) shows significant upside. The $47.57 Fair Value Per Share represents the value of Scholastic if it **successfully executes on its strategic pivot** and achieves its stated profit targets, overcoming the temporary headwinds in its Education segment.
