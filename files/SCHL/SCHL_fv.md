### 1. Initial Financial Data (Pro-Forma Balance Sheet)

The most recent complete balance sheet figures from an SEC filing are from the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended **November 30, 2024** (Q2 Fiscal Year 2025). However, a significant material event—the sale-leaseback of major real estate assets—occurred subsequently, generating an estimated \$401 million in net cash proceeds [cite: 2 (from step 2)], which must be included for a timely valuation.

*   **Key Drivers (Management Commentary):**
    *   **Book Fairs:** Expected to continue performing well with higher fair counts and revenue per fair [cite: 2 (from step 2)].
    *   **Education Solutions:** Volatile, facing headwinds from federal grant delays and state budget impasses [cite: 7 (from step 2)].
    *   **Trade Publishing:** Driven by "flagship franchises" (e.g., *Hunger Games* series) and general demand [cite: 5 (from step 2)].
    *   **9 Story Entertainment:** Recently acquired, consolidating into the Entertainment segment and expected to contribute to future revenue growth [cite: 5 (from step 2)].
    *   **Cost & Efficiency:** Management is focused on organizational changes and cost-saving initiatives to drive earnings growth in FY2026 and beyond [cite: 5, 7 (from step 2)].

| Fiscal Year (Ends May 31) | Growth Rate (Conservative Assumption) | Revenue (in Millions USD) | Justification/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | N/A | \$1,625.5 | Last Reported Actual Revenue [cite: 5 (from step 2)] |
| **2026** | 3.5% | \$1,682.4 | Conservative bump from 2% (FY25) due to full-year impact of 9 Story acquisition and expected strength in Book Fairs. |
| **2027** | 3.0% | \$1,732.9 | Assumes stabilization after the initial acquisition boost, with continued modest growth from core segments. |
| **2028** | 2.5% | \$1,776.2 | Conservative deceleration reflecting macro pressures on Education Solutions and the cyclical nature of publishing/IP. |
| **2029** | 2.0% | \$1,811.7 | Assumes long-term growth trends normalize to the historical rate. |
| **2030** | 1.5% | \$1,838.9 | Final year: Reflects a very conservative, below-inflation long-term growth rate. |

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

*   **FY2025 Adjusted Operating Margin:** $\approx 2.2\%$ (\$35.8M / \$1,625.5M) [cite: 5 (from step 2)].
*   **FY2026 Guidance:** Adjusted EBITDA of **\$146M - \$156M** (Midpoint: \$151M) [cite: 2 (from step 2)].
    *   Assuming an approximate 45% Net Income conversion from Adjusted EBITDA (a conservative but reasonable estimate given historical volatility and non-operating expenses) for a profitable year, the Net Income for FY2026 is projected to be $\$151M * 0.45 = \$68.0M$.
*   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** To be conservative but reflect management's focus on cost-saving and *earnings growth* (FY2026 guidance), I will project a **4.0%** Net Income Margin for the mature years, increasing from a conservative FY2026 estimate.

#### Net Income and ROIC Projection

| Fiscal Year (Ends May 31) | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (Conservative Assumption) | Net Income (B) (Straight to Cash) | ROIC % (Conservative) | ROIC Income (C) (B x ROIC % from Prior Year) | Total Projected Net Income (B+C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Actuals are Volatile) | \$1,625.5 | 0.0% | \$0.0 | N/A | N/A | \$0.0 |
| **2026** | \$1,682.4 | 4.0% | \$67.3 | **6.0%** | N/A | **\$67.3** |
| **2027** | \$1,732.9 | 4.0% | \$69.3 | 6.0% | \$4.0 | **\$73.3** |
| **2028** | \$1,776.2 | 4.0% | \$71.0 | 6.0% | \$4.4 | **\$75.4** |
| **2029** | \$1,811.7 | 4.0% | \$72.5 | 6.0% | \$4.5 | **\$77.0** |
| **2030** | \$1,838.9 | 4.0% | \$73.6 | 6.0% | \$4.6 | **\$78.2** |

*   **Net Income Margin:** A conservative 4.0% margin is used for profitable years, reflecting an improvement over the FY2025 adjusted operating margin of 2.2% but well below peak profitability, aligning with management's stated cost-saving and efficiency goals.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** Since the company's historical profitability has been volatile or negative, a positive yet conservative **6.0% ROIC** is selected as per the rule. This is justified by the large cash infusion from the real estate sale, which can be deployed to earn a reasonable return. ROIC Income (C) for the next year is calculated as the previous year's Net Income (B) multiplied by the 6.0% ROIC.

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Total Projected Net Income is treated as the unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCF) for this DCF model (Net Income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year).

#### Assumptions for DCF:

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**. This is a conservative WACC estimate for a company in the traditional media and education sector, accounting for business risks (e.g., funding volatility, publishing cycles).
2.  **Maturity Rate (Conservative Terminal Growth Rate):** **1.0%**. This is a very conservative terminal growth rate, well below inflation, reflecting long-term industry stagnation but a sustained presence.

#### Calculation of Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year | Cash Flow (Total Projected Net Income) (in Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 9.0%) ^ Year) | Present Value (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026 (Year 1)** | \$67.3 | 0.9174 | \$61.7 |
| **2027 (Year 2)** | \$73.3 | 0.8417 | \$61.7 |
| **2028 (Year 3)** | \$75.4 | 0.7722 | \$58.2 |
| **2029 (Year 4)** | \$77.0 | 0.7084 | \$54.6 |
| **2030 (Year 5)** | \$78.2 | 0.6499 | \$50.8 |
| **Sum of NPV of Forecast Period** | | | **\$287.0** |

#### Terminal Value Calculation

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow Year 5} * (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\$78.2 * (1 + 0.01)}{0.09 - 0.01} = \frac{\$78.98}{0.08} = \$987.25 \text{ million}$$

$$\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value} * \text{Discount Factor}_{Year 5}$$

$$\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \$987.25 * 0.6499 = **\$641.6 \text{ million}**$$

#### Total Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value)

$$\text{Total NPV} = \text{NPV of Forecast Period} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$$

$$\text{Total NPV} = \$287.0 \text{ million} + \$641.6 \text{ million} = **\$928.6 \text{ million}**$$

***

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total NPV} + \text{Pro-Forma Total Cash} - \text{Pro-Forma Total Debt}$$

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$928.6 \text{ million} + \$540.6 \text{ million} - \$256.2 \text{ million} = **\$1,213.0 \text{ million}**$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Total Shares Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\$1,213.0 \text{ million}}{25.05 \text{ million}} = **\$48.42$$

***

### 6. Summary and Market Comparison

| Metric | Valuation Result | Current Market Context (Approximate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **\$48.42** | |
| **Current Stock Price (Approx.)** | N/A (Cannot use a real-time price per instructions) | (Must be found by the reader for comparison) |
| **Current Market Capitalization** | N/A (Cannot use a real-time price per instructions) | |

The current market value of the stock can be inferred from the context of the valuation being requested, but without a direct quote, a comparison is made on the assumptions. Assuming the current market price is lower than the calculated fair value of \$48.42, the discrepancy is primarily due to the following assumptions:

#### Justification for Fair Value Discrepancy

**Why the Calculated Fair Value is Higher Than Market Price (Likely):**

1.  **Incorporation of Real Estate Proceeds:** The valuation *immediately* incorporates the **\$401 million** net cash from the post-quarter-end sale-leaseback, which translates to $\approx \$16.01$ per share in net cash alone (before debt reduction). The market may not have fully factored in the eventual deployment of this cash for shareholder value (e.g., share repurchases, debt paydown, or acquisitions) or may be discounting the *pro-forma* value due to the inherent risk of future corporate actions.
2.  **Conservative Future Profitability:** The valuation assumes a sustained **4.0% Net Income Margin** from FY2026 onwards, backed by management's focus on cost-saving and efficiency leading to earnings growth. The market, given Scholastic's history of volatile or net losses (as indicated by the need to use a conservative positive ROIC), is likely assigning a much lower or even zero net profit margin over the long term. The market may not fully trust the sustainability of the turnaround/efficiency initiatives.
3.  **Low Terminal Value Discounting:** The model uses a highly conservative **1.0% Maturity Rate** and a reasonable **9.0% Discount Rate**. However, if the market perceives a higher risk of competition from digital learning or if it applies a higher WACC (Discount Rate) due to perceived business cycle volatility, the NPV, particularly the Terminal Value, would be significantly lower. For example, a 10.0% WACC and 0.5% Terminal Growth would drastically reduce the NPV.

**Conclusion on Assumptions:**
The **\$48.42** fair value per share is primarily driven by the certainty of the large cash inflow (the \$401M) and a conservative assumption of sustained, positive mid-single-digit (4%) Net Income Margin. The market's lower valuation is likely a reflection of deep-seated skepticism regarding the *sustainability* of a 4% net margin in the publishing and education supply industries and the risk premium associated with the Education Solutions segment's volatile funding environment.
