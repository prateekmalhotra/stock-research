## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Lennar's core business engine is its **"land-light" strategy**, which emphasizes selling homes (volume) while minimizing owned land inventory and leveraging options for land control. This is a capital-efficient, high-turnover model that generates significant free cash flow but can pressure gross margins in soft markets. The primary revenue driver is **Home Deliveries $\times$ Average Sales Price (ASP)**.

### A. Core Engine Assumptions

| Metric | 2025 Projection | 2026 - 2030 Assumption | Rationale / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Home Deliveries** | 81,500 homes | +2.0% YoY | **Conservative for 2025:** Uses the low end of the Q4 2025 full-year guidance (81,500 - 82,500). **Conservative for Future:** Management is focused on volume, and the new land-light model (98% controlled homesites) is built for growth. A stable, conservative annual growth rate of 2.0% is applied, reflecting a normalized, long-term market growth rate post-incentive-driven ramp, and accounting for a conservative view on US housing demand/affordability constraints. |
| **Average Sales Price (ASP)** | $380,000 | +1.5% YoY | **Conservative for 2025:** Uses the low end of the Q4 2025 guidance ($380,000 - $390,000). ASP has been under pressure due to high incentives (13.3% in Q2 2025) to maintain volume. **Conservative for Future:** Assumes modest, long-term home price inflation below the long-term historical average to remain conservative and reflect the company's focus on affordability. |

### B. Projected Revenue Calculation

| Year | Home Deliveries | ASP (USD) | Homebuilding Revenue (A x B) | YoY Growth |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Base)** | 81,500 | $380,000 | $30.970 Billion | - |
| **2026** | 83,130 | $385,700 | $32.064 Billion | +3.54% |
| **2027** | 84,793 | $391,486 | $33.197 Billion | +3.53% |
| **2028** | 86,489 | $397,368 | $34.370 Billion | +3.53% |
| **2029** | 88,219 | $403,329 | $35.584 Billion | +3.53% |
| **2030** | 89,983 | $409,378 | $36.840 Billion | +3.53% |

## III. Margin and Net Income Projections

The market is heavily discounting Lennar's stock due to margin pressure (17.5% Gross Margin in Q3 2025). The core thesis is that the **volume focus and cost-savings** from the "land-light" model (which reduces working capital) will stabilize profitability.

### A. Margin and Non-Homebuilding Income Assumptions

| Metric | 2025 Projection | 2026 - 2030 Assumption | Rationale / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Homebuilding Gross Margin** | 17.5% | 18.0% (2026-2027), 18.5% (2028-2030) | **Conservative:** Starts at the Q3/Q4 2025 guidance of 17.5%. Assumes only a slight, gradual recovery and stabilization over the long term, well below historical highs (e.g., 22.5% in Q3 2024). |
| **SG&A as % of Revenue** | 8.0% | 7.5% (2026-2030) | **Conservative for 2025:** Uses the high end of Q4 2025 guidance (7.8% - 8.0%). **Conservative for Future:** Assumes efficiencies from the "Lennar Machine" and technology investments will eventually lower the overhead percentage as volume grows, but only to a moderate 7.5%. |
| **Non-Homebuilding Operating Earnings (Net Income)** | $580 Million | +3.0% YoY | This averages the full-year contribution from Financial Services, Multifamily, and Lennar Other. *Q3 2025 annualized* is roughly $590M (FS: $178M, Multi: -$16M, Other: $62M) $\times$ 4/3 quarters. To remain conservative, a stable base of **$580M** is used, with a conservative 3.0% growth rate. |
| **Tax Rate** | 24.5% | 24.5% | Consistent with the Q3 2025 effective tax rate of 24.4%. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | - | 7.0% | **Conservative:** This is a key driver. Historical TTM ROIC as of Aug 2025 is cited at 7.01%. The assumption is that all Net Income from the prior year is immediately reinvested in the business at this conservative historical rate. |

### B. Projected Net Income for DCF

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Homebuilding Revenue ($B) (A) | $30.970 | $32.064 | $33.197 | $34.370 | $35.584 | $36.840 |
| **Gross Profit %** | 17.5% | 18.0% | 18.0% | 18.5% | 18.5% | 18.5% |
| **Gross Profit ($B)** | $5.420 | $5.772 | $5.975 | $6.358 | $6.583 | $6.815 |
| SG&A % | 8.0% | 7.5% | 7.5% | 7.5% | 7.5% | 7.5% |
| **SG&A ($B)** | $2.478 | $2.405 | $2.490 | $2.578 | $2.669 | $2.763 |
| Homebuilding Op. Earnings ($B) | $2.942 | $3.367 | $3.485 | $3.780 | $3.914 | $4.052 |
| Non-HB Op. Earnings ($B) (B) | $0.580 | $0.597 | $0.615 | $0.633 | $0.652 | $0.671 |
| **Total Operating Earnings ($B) (A+B)** | $3.522 | $3.964 | $4.100 | $4.413 | $4.566 | $4.723 |
| Tax Rate | 24.5% | 24.5% | 24.5% | 24.5% | 24.5% | 24.5% |
| **Net Income from Operations ($B)** | $2.661 | $2.992 | $3.096 | $3.333 | $3.450 | $3.568 |
| ROIC on Prior Year Cash ($B) (C) | $0.098 | $0.186 | $0.207 | $0.230 | $0.254 | $0.279 |
| **Total Net Income / Cash Flow ($B)** | **$2.759** | **$3.178** | **$3.303** | **$3.563** | **$3.704** | **$3.847** |

*Note: ROIC Income (C) for 2026 is calculated as 7.0% $\times$ (2025 Net Income). For subsequent years, it is 7.0% $\times$ (Prior Year Cash Flow). The 2025 ROIC Income is 7.0% * $1.4B (Initial Cash).

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | **10.0%** | **Conservative/Reasonable:** This rate is higher than many corporate Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) figures and reflects the higher risk associated with the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and current high interest rate environment. |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | **2.0%** | **Very Conservative:** This assumes a modest long-term growth rate below the long-term US GDP growth rate. It reflects the view that while Lennar will continue to grow, the super-normal growth phase of the current housing boom is over. |

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Projected Cash Flow ($B) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value ($B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | $2.759 | 0.9091 | $2.508 |
| 2026 | $3.178 | 0.8264 | $2.626 |
| 2027 | $3.303 | 0.7513 | $2.482 |
| 2028 | $3.563 | 0.6830 | $2.435 |
| 2029 | $3.704 | 0.6209 | $2.299 |
| 2030 | $3.847 | 0.5645 | $2.171 |
| **Sum of Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | | | **$14.521 Billion** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation (Cash Flow beyond 2030)

1.  **Terminal Cash Flow (2031 Projection):**
    $2030 \text{ Cash Flow} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})$
    $= \$3.847 \text{ B} \times (1 + 0.02) = \$3.924 \text{ Billion}$

2.  **Terminal Value in 2030:**
    $\text{Terminal Cash Flow} / (\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})$
    $= \$3.924 \text{ B} / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$49.050 \text{ Billion}$

3.  **Net Present Value of Terminal Value (Today):**
    $\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$
    $= \$49.050 \text{ B} \times 0.5645 = \$27.685 \text{ Billion}$

4.  **Total Net Present Value (NPV):**
    $\text{NPV of Short-Term Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value}$
    $= \$14.521 \text{ B} + \$27.685 \text{ B} = \mathbf{\$42.206 \text{ Billion}}$

## Fair Value and Justification

The calculated Fair Value of Lennar Corporation (LEN) stock is **\$157.20 per share**.

*(Note: The current market price of LEN is not provided, so the final step assumes a placeholder to illustrate the justification against the market.)*

### Market Assumption Analysis

Assuming the current market value of LEN stock is **\$135.00** (for comparison purposes) the market is valuing the company lower than this DCF by approximately 14% ($\$157.20 - \$135.00$).

The market is making a **more conservative assumption** about the company's future profitability or growth than this model. The justification for the DCF's higher valuation is as follows:

1.  **Conservative Margin Stabilization:** The market may believe Lennar's Homebuilding Gross Margin will continue to decline or stay perpetually low (e.g., 16.0% - 17.0%) due to ongoing affordability issues requiring high incentives. This DCF assumes a modest recovery and stabilization at **18.5% by 2028**, a margin that is still conservative compared to the historical 22%+ figures. The market is likely pricing in a "lower for longer" margin scenario.
2.  **Discounting of the "Land-Light" Model:** The market may not fully believe in the capital efficiency of the land-light model translating into true cash flow. The DCF assumes the past ROIC of **7.0%** can be maintained on reinvested profits, which generates significant secondary income (the ROIC assumption in 2030 accounts for $\sim 7.8\%$ of total cash flow in that year). The market is likely pricing in a lower future ROIC, penalizing the cyclical and capital-intensive nature of the industry despite the "land-light" strategic shift.
3.  **Macro-Economic Risk:** The homebuilding industry is highly sensitive to interest rates. The market is likely using an even higher implied **Discount Rate** (e.g., 11.0% to 12.0%) to account for the risk of a prolonged high-interest-rate environment, which would depress the Net Present Value of future cash flows. A 12.0% discount rate would bring the fair value closer to the assumed market price.

**Conclusion:** The calculated fair value of **\$157.20** is justified by assuming that Lennar's management will successfully execute its volume-focused, capital-efficient **"land-light" strategy**, allowing for a modest stabilization and improvement in gross margins and the ability to reinvest retained earnings at a conservative historical rate (7.0% ROIC). The market's lower valuation is likely due to the expectation of a more prolonged and deeper decline in profitability and a higher risk premium (Discount Rate) on all future cash flows.
