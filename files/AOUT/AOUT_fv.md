### Step 2: Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projection

American Outdoor Brands' business engine is centered on its **Brand Portfolio Management Strategy (BPMS)**, which focuses on repeatable innovation, expanding distribution (traditional and e-commerce), and strengthening margins in the outdoor enthusiast market. The key performance drivers are new product launches (management has stated they have a "most robust new product pipeline ever") and growth in the **Outdoor Lifestyle** category (which grew by 16.2% in FY25).

The challenge for forward projection is that management suspended its previous guidance due to a dynamic macro environment and a significant acceleration of approximately **\$8 million to \$10 million** in orders from Fiscal Year 2026 into Q4 Fiscal Year 2025.

**Engine Assumptions:**

1.  **Normalization of FY25/FY26:** The \$222.3 million FY25 net sales must be adjusted for the revenue acceleration. We will use the midpoint of the range for acceleration: \$9.0 million.
    *   *Normalized FY25 Revenue Base:* \$222.3M - \$9.0M = **\$213.3M**.
2.  **FY26 Revenue:** Management noted that *without* the accelerated orders, Q1 FY26 sales decline would have been only 4.7%. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty and suspended guidance, we must be conservative. We will assume the company maintains this *normalized* revenue base, projecting **0%** growth for FY26 on the normalized FY25 base, reflecting a stabilization year where innovation offsets market weakness.
3.  **Long-Term Revenue Growth (FY27 - FY30):** The company's long-term strategy focuses on a robust new product pipeline and growth in the higher-margin Outdoor Lifestyle category. We will assume a conservative, steady-state organic growth rate of **3.5%** per year. This rate is slightly higher than the implied low-single-digit historical CAGR but is reasonable for an asset-light, innovation-focused business once macro headwinds ease.

**Revenue Projection Table (in millions USD)**

| Metric | FY25 (Actual) | FY26 (Projected) | FY27 (Projected) | FY28 (Projected) | FY29 (Projected) | FY30 (Projected) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales** | \$222.3 | **\$213.3** (0% Growth on Normalized Base) | **\$220.8** (3.5% Growth) | **\$228.5** (3.5% Growth) | **\$236.5** (3.5% Growth) | **\$244.8** (3.5% Growth) |

### Step 3: Net Income and Cash Flow Projection

#### Margin Assumptions

*   **Gross Margin (%):** Management's long-term target is the "mid-40s". While Q1 FY26 hit 46.7%, we will use a conservative, stable **45.0%**.
*   **Operating Expense (OpEx) (%):** FY25 Non-GAAP OpEx was \$86.9M on \$222.3M revenue, or 39.1%. We assume the company's "lean, agile, and asset-light model" allows them to maintain a consistent non-GAAP OpEx of **39.0%** of net sales.
*   **Tax Rate:** A long-term corporate tax rate of **25.0%** is used.
*   **ROIC on Retained Earnings:** The company's historical ROIC has been negative [cite: 1 in step 1]. Since we project future profitability, we must use a conservative, but positive, assumption for the return on retained net income. We will use **8.0%**.

#### Net Income Projection (DCF Cash Flow)

| Metric | FY26 | FY27 | FY28 | FY29 | FY30 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales (A)** | \$213.3 | \$220.8 | \$228.5 | \$236.5 | \$244.8 |
| **Gross Margin (45.0%)** | \$96.0 | \$99.4 | \$102.8 | \$106.4 | \$110.2 |
| **Operating Expense (39.0%)** | \$83.2 | \$86.1 | \$89.1 | \$92.2 | \$95.5 |
| **EBIT (Operating Income)** | \$12.8 | \$13.3 | \$13.7 | \$14.2 | \$14.7 |
| **Net Income before ROIC (B = EBIT * 75%)** | \$9.6 | \$10.0 | \$10.3 | \$10.7 | \$11.0 |
| **Cash from Prior Year's Net Income** | \$0.0 | \$9.6 | \$10.0 | \$10.3 | \$10.7 |
| **Income from ROIC (8.0%) (C)** | \$0.0 | \$0.8 | \$0.8 | \$0.8 | \$0.8 |
| **Net Income (Cash Flow) (B + C)** | **\$9.6** | **\$10.7** | **\$11.1** | **\$11.5** | **\$11.9** |

*Note: All figures in millions USD.*

### Step 4: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** We will use a conservative but reasonable discount rate of **10.0%** to reflect the risk of a small-cap company in the consumer cyclical sector with recent revenue volatility.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** A very conservative long-term growth rate of **2.0%** is assumed, slightly below global GDP growth, reflecting an established company in a mature market.

#### A. Net Present Value of Explicit Forecast Period (FY26 - FY30)

| Year | Cash Flow (B+C) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY26** | \$9.6 | 0.9091 | \$8.73 |
| **FY27** | \$10.7 | 0.8264 | \$8.84 |
| **FY28** | \$11.1 | 0.7513 | \$8.34 |
| **FY29** | \$11.5 | 0.6830 | \$7.85 |
| **FY30** | \$11.9 | 0.6209 | \$7.39 |
| **Total NPV of Explicit Cash Flows (E)** | | | **\$41.15** |

*Note: Cash Flow figures in millions USD. NPV in millions USD.*

#### B. Terminal Value Calculation (FY30 and Beyond)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the perpetuity growth formula:
TV = Cash Flow (FY30) * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
TV = \$11.9 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02)
TV = \$11.9 * 1.02 / 0.08
TV = \$12.138 / 0.08
**TV = \$151.725 million**

#### C. Net Present Value of Terminal Value

NPV of TV = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (FY30)
NPV of TV = \$151.725 * 0.6209
**NPV of TV (F) = \$94.19 million**

#### D. Total Enterprise Value (EV)

Total EV = NPV of Explicit Cash Flows (E) + NPV of Terminal Value (F)
Total EV = \$41.15M + \$94.19M
**Total EV = \$135.34 million**

### Step 5: Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (Total NPV of Cash Flows)** | \$135.34 |
| **Add: Current Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$17.80 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | \$0.00 |
| **Equity Value (Fair Value of Company)** | **\$153.14** |
| **Shares Outstanding (G)** | 12.9 million |
| **Fair Value per Share (Equity Value / G)** | **\$11.87** |

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (Calculated)** | **\$11.87** |
| **Current Stock Price (Market Value)** | **\$6.78** |
| **Implied Upside** | **75.1%** |

#### Justification for Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$11.87** is significantly higher (75.1% upside) than the current market price of **\$6.78**. This discrepancy suggests the market is making much more pessimistic assumptions about the company's future performance than this conservative model.

**Market's Pessimistic Assumptions (Implied by Low Price):**

1.  **Lower Long-Term Growth Rate:** The market is likely pricing in a longer period of stagnation or even decline. The FY26 revenue shock (from the adjusted Q1 decline and suspended guidance) is likely spooking investors, who may fear the *Outdoor Lifestyle* category growth is not sustainable and that the core business will continue to contract under macro-economic stress.
2.  **Lower Margins / Inefficiency:** The market may be assuming the company's OpEx will not remain lean (39.0%) as revenue shrinks, leading to operating deleveraging and a lower Net Income margin than the projected 4.5% - 4.8%. The market may also doubt the ability to consistently achieve the "mid-40s" gross margin target.
3.  **Higher Discount Rate:** Given the recent revenue volatility (FY25 growth followed by FY26 order acceleration/slowdown) and the lack of forward guidance, the market likely applies a much higher risk premium (Discount Rate) than the 10.0% used here, significantly reducing the Net Present Value of future cash flows.

**Justification for Model's Assumptions (Why the Fair Value is Higher):**

1.  **Focus on Core Strengths:** The model focuses on the core of the management's strategy—the asset-light model, which protects against large fixed-cost losses, and a strong, new product pipeline. The 0% growth for FY26 is already a very conservative assumption that absorbs the *full* impact of the macro headwinds and order pull-forward.
2.  **Debt-Free Balance Sheet:** The zero debt and positive cash position of \$17.8 million provide a strong floor to the valuation, which a struggling company with heavy debt would lack. This gives the company maximum flexibility for innovation and share buybacks.
3.  **Conservative Long-Term View:** The 3.5% terminal growth rate is modest, relying on the company's focus on organic growth and innovation in the *Outdoor Lifestyle* segment (16.2% growth in FY25) to stabilize the business, not an aggressive recovery.

The current market price appears to reflect an extreme short-term pessimism, potentially overlooking the company's clean balance sheet (zero debt), management's commitment to maintaining lean operations, and the long-term potential of the innovative brand strategy. The calculated **\$11.87** fair value is a more reasonable estimate for a company executing on its margin and cost-control initiatives with a new product-driven growth engine.
