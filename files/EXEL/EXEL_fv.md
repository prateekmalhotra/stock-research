### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The core of the Exelixis business is the oncology franchise. The primary revenue driver is **Cabozantinib (CABOMETYX/COMETRIQ)**, and the key growth catalyst is the pipeline product, **Zanzalintinib (Zanz)**.

**Key Drivers and Assumptions:**

1.  **Cabozantinib (CABO) - The Foundation:**
    *   The 2025 full-year total revenue guidance is approximately **$2.3 billion to $2.35 billion**. I will use the conservative midpoint of **$2.325 billion** for 2025.
    *   Management has an "aspirational revenue goal" of **$3 billion by 2030** for Cabozantinib. This represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 5.8% from the 2025 starting point. I will be conservative and assume a slightly lower, tapering growth rate that meets the aspirational goal.
    *   The recent approval for Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) is a new tailwind, with the launch off to a strong start, growing 50% quarter-over-quarter and exceeding $100 million in expected sales for the full year. This helps sustain mid-single-digit growth for the core franchise.
2.  **Zanzalintinib (Zanz) - The Growth Engine:**
    *   Zanzalintinib is the next-generation TKI, with an NDA planned by year-end and pivotal trials ongoing.
    *   Management has an "aspirational revenue goal" of **$5 billion by 2033** for Zanzalintinib, stating it is expected to surpass Cabozantinib in scope and scale.
    *   **Conservative Approval/Launch Timeline:** I will assume a conservative FDA approval/launch in late **2026**. I will project a slow ramp-up, being very conservative with an aspirational, pipeline product:
        *   **2027:** $150 million (Initial uptake)
        *   **2028:** $500 million (Initial full year of sales and a few more indications/geographies)
        *   **2029:** $1.0 billion (Accelerating uptake, solidifying role)
        *   **2030:** $1.5 billion (Continued strong ramp-up)
3.  **Collaboration/Royalty Revenue:** Collaboration and royalty revenues will be projected to grow modestly, tied to the overall growth of the CABO franchise globally. I will assume a long-term average of 8% of total CABO sales, incorporating potential milestone revenue.

| Year | CABO Revenue ($M) | Zanz Revenue ($M) | Collaboration/Royalty ($M) | **Total Revenue ($M)** | CAGR (from prior year) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Historical Est.)** | $2,169.0* | $0.0 | $360.0* | **$2,529.0** | N/A |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | $2,000.0 | $0.0 | $325.0 | **$2,325.0** | -8.1% |
| **2026** | $2,100.0 | $0.0 | $300.0 | **$2,400.0** | 3.2% |
| **2027** | $2,200.0 | $150.0 | $350.0 | **$2,700.0** | 12.5% |
| **2028** | $2,400.0 | $500.0 | $400.0 | **$3,300.0** | 22.2% |
| **2029** | $2,700.0 | $1,000.0 | $450.0 | **$4,150.0** | 25.8% |
| **2030** | $3,000.0 | $1,500.0 | $500.0 | **$5,000.0** | 20.5% |
| ***Source: 2024 is based on prior year's full results for context*.* | | | | | |

*2025 revenue is lower than 2024 primarily due to a lower assumption of non-recurring collaboration/milestone revenue for the first year of the projection, as Q4 2024 included a significant amount of collaboration revenues.*

### **III. Margin and Net Income Projections**

1.  **Gross Margin (GM):** Exelixis has a historically very high gross margin. Q3 2025 Gross Margin was nearly 97%. I will use a conservative **95%** Gross Margin throughout the projection, reflecting the high-margin nature of branded oncology pharmaceuticals.
2.  **Operating Expenses (OpEx):** OpEx consists mainly of R&D and SG&A.
    *   **R&D:** Will remain high to support the Zanzalintinib launch and the overall pipeline, consistent with management's commentary on disciplined expense management and prioritizing R&D. I will model R&D expenses to increase from approximately $1.1B (estimated 2024 based on a run-rate from Q4'24) to a peak of $1.5B in 2029, then flatten as the pipeline matures.
    *   **SG&A:** Will increase moderately from approximately $450M (estimated 2024) to support the commercial launches of Zanzalintinib, peaking at $650M by 2030.
3.  **Net Income Margin & Tax Rate:** The company's Q3 2025 GAAP Net Income was $193.6 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was approximately 20% (Provision for Income Taxes / Pre-tax Income from 10-Q). I will use a conservative long-term federal and state tax rate of **22%**.

| Year | Total Revenue ($M) | Gross Profit (95%) ($M) | R&D Exp. ($M) | SG&A Exp. ($M) | Operating Income ($M) | Pre-Tax Income ($M) | Tax (22%) ($M) | **Net Income ($M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2,325.0 | $2,208.8 | $1,150.0 | $480.0 | $578.8 | $578.8 | $127.3 | **$451.5** |
| **2026** | $2,400.0 | $2,280.0 | $1,250.0 | $520.0 | $510.0 | $510.0 | $112.2 | **$397.8** |
| **2027** | $2,700.0 | $2,565.0 | $1,350.0 | $550.0 | $665.0 | $665.0 | $146.3 | **$518.7** |
| **2028** | $3,300.0 | $3,135.0 | $1,400.0 | $600.0 | $1,135.0 | $1,135.0 | $249.7 | **$885.3** |
| **2029** | $4,150.0 | $3,942.5 | $1,500.0 | $625.0 | $1,817.5 | $1,817.5 | $400.0 | **$1,417.5** |
| **2030** | $5,000.0 | $4,750.0 | $1,500.0 | $650.0 | $2,600.0 | $2,600.0 | $572.0 | **$2,028.0** |

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The instruction states: "Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year. Then get a reasonable ROIC percentage based on the past to get additional income for the next year."

1.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
    *   One secondary source cites a historical ROIC of 21.33%.
    *   Given the high capital intensity of R&D and the large cash balance, I will use a conservative and sustainable **10.0% ROIC** on the cumulative cash balance (Net Income from prior years) to generate additional income.

2.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):**
    *   A high discount rate is conservative for a biotech with a pipeline that still carries significant risk, despite the strong commercial product.
    *   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%**

3.  **Terminal Value (Conservative Maturity Rate):**
    *   The long-term maturity rate for the terminal value calculation should be highly conservative, representing perpetual growth.
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**

4.  **Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Net Present Value (NPV):**

| Year | Projected Net Income ($M) | Cash Balance (Beginning of Year) ($M) | ROIC Income (10%) ($M) | **FCF (Cash Flow for Valuation) ($M)** | Discount Factor (10.0%) | **NPV of FCF ($M)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $451.5 | $1,570.0 | $157.0 | **$608.5** | 0.9091 | $553.2 |
| **2026** | $397.8 | $2,021.5 | $202.2 | **$600.0** | 0.8264 | $495.8 |
| **2027** | $518.7 | $2,419.3 | $241.9 | **$760.6** | 0.7513 | $571.4 |
| **2028** | $885.3 | $3,180.0 | $318.0 | **$1,203.3** | 0.6830 | $821.9 |
| **2029** | $1,417.5 | $4,383.3 | $438.3 | **$1,855.8** | 0.6209 | $1,152.2 |
| **2030** | $2,028.0 | $6,239.1 | $623.9 | **$2,651.9** | 0.5645 | $1,497.1 |
| **SUM of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **$5,091.6** |

5.  **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**

*   Terminal Value (TV) in 2030 = [FCF (2030) \* (1 + g)] / (Discount Rate - g)
*   TV in 2030 = [$2,651.9M \* (1 + 0.025)] / (0.10 - 0.025)
*   TV in 2030 = $2,718.2M / 0.075
*   **Terminal Value in 2030 = $36,242.0 million**

6.  **NPV of Terminal Value:**

*   NPV of TV = TV in 2030 \* Discount Factor (2030)
*   NPV of TV = $36,242.0M \* 0.5645
*   **NPV of Terminal Value = $20,457.9 million**

7.  **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):**

*   TEV = SUM of NPV (2025-2030) + NPV of Terminal Value
*   TEV = $5,091.6M + $20,457.9M
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $25,549.5 million**

#### **Final Fair Value of Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL) Stock:**

**Fair Value per Share: $101.15**

#### **Justification and Market Comparison**

The calculated fair value of **$101.15** is significantly higher than the current market price of approximately **$41.25**. The market is clearly making assumptions that are dramatically different from this model.

**Analysis of the Market's Assumed Discount:**

The primary reason for the large difference is that this valuation aggressively incorporates the potential successful commercialization of **Zanzalintinib (Zanz)** and the long-term sustainability of the **Cabozantinib (CABO)** franchise.

1.  **Risk of Pipeline Failure (Zanzalintinib):**
    *   The market is likely applying an extremely high risk-adjustment factor (or probability of failure) to Zanzalintinib. Biotech valuations are often driven by binary events. If Zanzalintinib's key trials fail or regulatory approval is delayed/limited, the $1.5 billion in projected 2030 revenue will not materialize.
    *   *My conservative assumption:* I assumed a successful launch in late 2026 and a ramp-up to $1.5B by 2030, which is still well below the company's aspirational $5B by 2033 goal. The market is effectively assigning a very low probability (e.g., < 40%) to this success.

2.  **Risk of CABO Patent Cliff and Competition:**
    *   CABOMETYX is the current revenue engine. The market is discounting future cash flows due to the eventual loss of exclusivity (patent cliff) and increased competition in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and other indications. While the company is exempt from price negotiation under the IRA until 2027, the long-term outlook for the core product is risky.
    *   *My assumption:* I assumed CABO revenues reach the management's aspirational goal of $3 billion by 2030. The market is likely forecasting a steeper, earlier decline in CABO sales after its primary patents begin to expire.

3.  **High R&D Investment:**
    *   The company is reinvesting a significant portion of its profits into R&D for the new pipeline, resulting in relatively flat net income in the near term (2025-2027) even with revenue growth. The market dislikes large cash burn into uncertain pipeline assets.
    *   *My assumption:* I am essentially valuing the current R&D spend as a *successful investment* that generates high returns (Zanzalintinib revenue) in the out-years. The market views this spending as a higher-risk operational drag.

**Conclusion:**

The Fair Value of **$101.15** represents a bull-case scenario where the company successfully executes on its strategy: the CABOMETYX franchise remains strong and reaches the $3 billion target, and the key pipeline asset, Zanzalintinib, secures approval and achieves an early-stage blockbuster sales trajectory.

The current market price of **$41.25** is discounting this future growth severely, indicating that the market is assigning a substantial risk-factor, particularly to the successful commercialization of Zanzalintinib. **The market essentially views EXEL as a slow-growth CABOMETYX-only company with an uncertain pipeline, whereas this valuation views EXEL as a high-growth, multi-product oncology company based on management's aspirational goals.**
