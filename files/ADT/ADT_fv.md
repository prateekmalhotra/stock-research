## **2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

### **Business Engine & Assumptions**

The core business of ADT is driven by **Recurring Monthly Revenue (RMR)**, which is essentially the subscription base, and **Installation Revenue**, which is growing due to a strategic shift.

1.  **Recurring Monthly Revenue (RMR):**
    *   **Current State:** End-of-period RMR is \$362 million, up 1% year-over-year. This implies an annualized RMR of \$4.344 billion.
    *   **Headwinds:** Gross customer revenue attrition is high at 13.0%, driven by macro-economic pressure and non-payment cancellations.
    *   **Tailwinds:** The company is expanding its ADT+ platform, which is leading to higher-value outright sales and is expected to improve long-term retention.
    *   **Assumption:** Given the combination of slow RMR growth (1-2%) and a high attrition rate (13.0%), a conservative long-term RMR growth rate is prudent. The RMR is the durable, high-margin part of the business, but competitive and macroeconomic factors cap its growth.
        *   **2026-2030 RMR Annual Growth Rate: 2.5%** (Slightly above the current 1% to account for improved value from the ADT+ platform, but conservative due to high attrition).

2.  **Installation, Product, and Other Revenue:**
    *   **Current State:** Installation revenue was up 21% in Q3 2025. This is due to the mix shift to outright sales with the ADT+ platform.
    *   **Assumption:** The transition to outright sales will continue but will moderate as the installed base stabilizes.
        *   **2026-2027 Installation/Other Revenue Annual Growth Rate: 10%** (To capture the ongoing transition and adoption of ADT+).
        *   **2028-2030 Installation/Other Revenue Annual Growth Rate: 5%** (To reflect a more mature growth rate once the platform transition is complete).

3.  **Revenue Split:** For 2025, RMR Revenue is estimated as the annualized Q3 RMR (\$4.344B). Installation/Other Revenue is the remainder of the total guidance: \$5.125B - \$4.344B = \$781M.

### **Revenue Projection Table (in millions USD)**

| Year | RMR Revenue Assumption (Annualized) | Installation/Other Revenue Assumption | Total Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Base) | \$4,344 | \$781 | **\$5,125** (Management Guidance Midpoint) |
| **2026** | \$4,344 * 1.025 = \$4,453 | \$781 * 1.10 = \$859 | **\$5,312** |
| **2027** | \$4,453 * 1.025 = \$4,564 | \$859 * 1.10 = \$945 | **\$5,509** |
| **2028** | \$4,564 * 1.025 = \$4,678 | \$945 * 1.05 = \$992 | **\$5,670** |
| **2029** | \$4,678 * 1.025 = \$4,795 | \$992 * 1.05 = \$1,042 | **\$5,837** |
| **2030** | \$4,795 * 1.025 = \$4,915 | \$1,042 * 1.05 = \$1,094 | **\$6,009** |

## **3. Net Income Projection (2025-2030)**

### **Margin and Income Calculation**

1.  **2025 Net Income Base:**
    *   **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** \$2,690M / \$5,125M = 52.5% (Based on guidance midpoint)
    *   **Conservative Net Income Margin (Pre-ROIC):** Based on the high adjusted EBITDA margin, the core business is highly profitable. Past GAAP Net Income has been volatile due to non-cash items and debt servicing. The company's focus on debt refinancing to lower interest costs (average cost of debt at 4.3%) will positively impact Net Income.
        *   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** Start with a conservative **5.0%** in 2025, which is lower than the TTM GAAP Net Income margin implied by the Q3 YTD figures, providing a conservative base for DCF.

2.  **Margin Growth (2026-2030):**
    *   Management's focus on operational efficiency, AI-driven customer service, and debt reduction suggests a slight margin expansion is achievable.
    *   **Net Income Margin Growth Assumption:** Increase the margin by **0.5%** per year, from 5.0% to 7.5% by 2030, which is conservative given the over 50% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

| Year | Total Revenue (M) | Net Income Margin (Assumption) | Net Income (Projected, M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$5,125 | 5.0% | \$256.3 |
| **2026** | \$5,312 | 5.5% | \$292.2 |
| **2027** | \$5,509 | 6.0% | \$330.5 |
| **2028** | \$5,670 | 6.5% | \$368.6 |
| **2029** | \$5,837 | 7.0% | \$408.6 |
| **2030** | \$6,009 | 7.5% | \$450.7 |

### **ROIC and Compounding Cash Flow**

The rule states: Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year (Projected) + ROIC from net income got from previous year.

*   **ROIC Determination:** Publicly available return on invested capital (ROIC) for ADT is around 7.09%. Given the request for a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC, I will use a slight haircut on this and use a low, stable reinvestment rate.
    *   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **5.0%**

| Year | Projected Net Income (M) | Cash from Previous Year (M) | ROIC Income (M) (Cash * 5.0%) | Net Cash Flow (M) (Projected NI + ROIC Income) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$256.3 | N/A (Starting Year) | N/A | **\$256.3** |
| **2026** | \$292.2 | \$256.3 (from 2025) | \$256.3 * 0.05 = \$12.8 | **\$305.0** |
| **2027** | \$330.5 | \$305.0 (from 2026) | \$305.0 * 0.05 = \$15.3 | **\$345.8** |
| **2028** | \$368.6 | \$345.8 (from 2027) | \$345.8 * 0.05 = \$17.3 | **\$385.9** |
| **2029** | \$408.6 | \$385.9 (from 2028) | \$385.9 * 0.05 = \$19.3 | **\$427.9** |
| **2030** | \$450.7 | \$427.9 (from 2029) | \$427.9 * 0.05 = \$21.4 | **\$472.1** |

## **4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

### **Discount Rate (WACC) and Terminal Growth Rate**

1.  **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC) Assumption:** Given ADT's high debt-to-equity ratio and the current elevated interest rate environment, a high discount rate is necessary to reflect the risk and cost of capital.
    *   **Assumed Discount Rate (WACC): 10.0%** (This is a conservative rate, higher than typical for mature utility-like businesses, but appropriate for a highly leveraged firm in a competitive, evolving market).

2.  **Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate) Assumption:** The terminal growth rate should be extremely conservative, reflecting a growth rate no faster than the long-term expected rate of inflation and/or GDP.
    *   **Assumed Terminal Growth Rate: 2.0%**

### **Terminal Value Calculation (2030)**

The cash flow in 2030 represents the last projected cash flow (C_T). The cash flow for year 2031 is assumed to grow at the terminal growth rate.
*   **Terminal Value (TV) Formula:** $\text{TV} = \frac{\text{C}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}}$
*   **Inputs:** $\text{C}_{2030} = \$472.1M$, $\text{g} = 2.0\%$, $\text{WACC} = 10.0\%$
*   $\text{TV}_{2030} = \frac{\$472.1 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$481.542}{0.08} = \$6,019.275M$

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (C_t) (M) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + WACC)^t) | Present Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (t=1) | \$256.3 | $1 / (1.10)^1 = 0.9091$ | \$233.00 |
| **2026** (t=2) | \$305.0 | $1 / (1.10)^2 = 0.8264$ | \$252.05 |
| **2027** (t=3) | \$345.8 | $1 / (1.10)^3 = 0.7513$ | \$259.88 |
| **2028** (t=4) | \$385.9 | $1 / (1.10)^4 = 0.6830$ | \$263.63 |
| **2029** (t=5) | \$427.9 | $1 / (1.10)^5 = 0.6209$ | \$265.68 |
| **2030** (t=6) | \$472.1 + \$6,019.3 (TV) = \$6,491.4 | $1 / (1.10)^6 = 0.5645$ | \$3,664.21 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$4,938.45M** |

## **5. Fair Value Calculation**

### **Fair Value per Share**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | \$4,938.45 |
| **Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$63.0 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | (\$7,806.0) |
| **Equity Value** | **(\$2,804.55)** |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | 824.59 Million |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **(\$3.40)** |

## **6. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value of ADT Inc. Stock: (\$3.40) per share**

**Current Market Price of ADT Inc. Stock: \$8.84 per share**

### **Justification for the Discrepancy**

My conservative valuation yields a negative fair value of **(\$3.40) per share**, which is significantly lower than the market price of **\$8.84 per share**. This suggests that the market is making much more optimistic assumptions about the company's ability to convert its strong Recurring Monthly Revenue (RMR) base into Net Income (Free Cash Flow) than my conservative model allows.

**My Conservative Assumptions vs. Market Assumptions:**

| Factor | My Assumption (Conservative) | Market's Implied Assumption (Optimistic) | Justification for Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Engine Conversion** | Net Income Margin starting at 5.0% and only growing to 7.5% by 2030. | A significantly higher net income margin and/or a much lower "cash cost of subscriber acquisition." | The market is likely valuing ADT closer to a **Free Cash Flow (FCF) model**, often called "Adjusted Free Cash Flow including swaps" (projected at \$800M - \$900M for 2025) rather than a purely Net Income model, which my model uses. The FCF metric excludes cash for subscriber acquisition (SAC), a major expense. ADT's high FCF is a key talking point for management and is the likely focus of the market. |
| **Growth Rate (RMR)** | 2.5% RMR growth, despite the RMR balance being up only 1% year-over-year. | Higher RMR growth (likely 3-4%+) and/or a rapid reduction in attrition (currently 13.0%), due to the success of the ADT+ platform. | The market believes the transition to ADT+ will lead to far superior customer lifetime value (CLV) and retention, dramatically improving future cash flows. |
| **Debt Burden** | Total Debt of \$7.8 Billion is fully accounted for in the equity value calculation. | The market might be applying a lower WACC, or essentially discounting the debt by anticipating that the recurring, high-margin revenue stream will support a higher leverage ratio indefinitely. | My high WACC of 10.0% and the subtraction of the substantial debt load (\$7.8B) is a major factor in the negative equity value. The market is comfortable with a high leverage ratio (2.8x Adjusted EBITDA). |
| **Valuation Metric** | Net Income (Post-ROIC) as a proxy for unlevered FCF (DCF Model) for conservatism. | Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) as the primary valuation metric. | **If I had used the mid-point of 2025 Adjusted FCF Guidance (\$850M) as a starting point, the valuation would be substantially higher, likely aligning with the market price.** |

The fundamental reason for the highly negative fair value is the rule's instruction to use **Net Income** and subtract the large **Total Debt**, which is a problematic approach for a capital-intensive, high-leverage business like ADT whose valuation is primarily driven by its subscription base's **Adjusted Free Cash Flow**. By adhering strictly to the rules, the model is unable to properly capture the value of ADT's **Subscription-based Business Engine** which is designed to generate significant cash flow *after* interest, but *before* principal payments on the substantial debt, and where a large portion of capital expenditure is for subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), which is a growth expense, not just maintenance.
