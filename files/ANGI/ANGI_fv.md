### **2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection Justification**

Angi is currently undergoing a strategic transformation, prioritizing **profitability and customer experience** over top-line growth. The key drivers are:
*   **Strategic Shift to Quality over Volume:** The decline in revenue (Q3 2025 revenue was down 10% YoY) is a deliberate consequence of stripping out "lower value revenue streams" and inefficient marketing spend, as management noted improved marketing efficiency.
*   **Proprietary Volume & Retention:** The business engine's long-term health is driven by improving the core user experience ("consumer choice"), which has led to the first quarter of proprietary volume growth since early 2021 and a **20% improvement in Pro retention**. This focus on the supply (Pros) and the core customer journey is the engine for future profitable growth.
*   **Management Guidance:** Management expects to **"hold profit" in 2025** and then to **"stair step-up and grow in 2026"**.

**Revenue Projections (in millions):**

| Year | Growth Rate | Justification | Revenue Projection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (LTM)** | - | Baseline | **\$1,090.0** |
| **2025** | -5.0% | Conservative decline (less than Q3 2025's -10% YoY) to reflect the strategic cutbacks and "hold profit" guidance amidst revenue decline. | \$1,090.0 * 0.95 = **\$1,035.5** |
| **2026** | +5.0% | Conservative growth based on management's guidance of a "return to growth", reflecting the initial impact of the new, more efficient platform and proprietary volume growth. | \$1,035.5 * 1.05 = **\$1,087.3** |
| **2027** | +8.0% | Higher growth as the platform's improvements gain critical mass in customer and Pro adoption, leveraging the improved unit economics. | \$1,087.3 * 1.08 = **\$1,174.3** |
| **2028** | +7.0% | Continued strong, but moderating, growth as the turnaround solidifies and the market normalizes. | \$1,174.3 * 1.07 = **\$1,256.5** |
| **2029** | +6.0% | Steady growth as the company matures into a highly efficient marketplace model. | \$1,256.5 * 1.06 = **\$1,332.9** |
| **2030** | +5.0% | Conservative long-term growth for a tech-enabled services company in a large but competitive market. | \$1,332.9 * 1.05 = **\$1,399.5** |

### **3. Margin & Net Income Projection Justification**

The high Gross Margin (GM) of ~95% indicates the primary operating leverage comes from reducing Selling & Marketing (S&M) and General & Administrative (G&A) expenses. Management has already demonstrated this by increasing operating income despite revenue declines.

**Net Income Margin Assumptions:**

| Year | Net Income Margin | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 3.30% | Historical LTM Net Income Margin. |
| **2025** | 4.00% | Slight improvement from 2024 to reflect "hold profit" guidance on lower revenue, which is only possible through significant cost control and efficiency improvements. |
| **2026** | 4.50% | Initial benefits of revenue growth on a more efficient cost structure. |
| **2027** | 5.00% | Continued operating leverage from scale and technological improvements (matching/monetization). |
| **2028** | 5.50% | Further maturation of the high-margin, proprietary-volume-driven business. |
| **2029** | 6.00% | Approaching mid-term margin target for a platform business with a high GM. |
| **2030** | 6.50% | Conservative maximum operating leverage for the forecast period. |

### **4. ROIC and Discount Rate Assumptions**

*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The last reported ROIC was low (3.21% or 1.90%). However, the rule mandates a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC for new cash. Given the strategic shift towards profitability and efficiency, new capital is expected to generate a better return.
    *   **ROIC Assumption:** **5.0%**.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** This represents the company's assumed growth rate forever after 2030.
    *   **Maturity Rate Assumption (g):** **2.0%**. This is very conservative, lower than long-term US GDP growth, reflecting an assumption of intense competition in the mature home services market.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** The weighted average cost of capital. ANGI's stock has a high Beta (1.73), suggesting higher volatility and risk.
    *   **Discount Rate Assumption (r):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative, high rate for a technology-enabled company, reflecting the company's volatility and ongoing turnaround risk.

### **5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

The cash flow for valuation is defined as the Net Income for the year plus the additional income generated by the previous year's accumulated cash (Net Income * ROIC).

**Formula for Cash Flow (CF):**
CF_y = (Revenue_y * Net Income Margin_y) + (Accumulated Cash_y-1 * ROIC)

**Formula for Terminal Value (TV):**
TV_2030 = (CF_2030 * (1 + g)) / (r - g)

| Year | Revenue (M) | NI Margin | Net Income (M) | Accumulated Cash (M) | ROIC Add. Income (M) | Total Cash Flow (M) | Disc. Factor (10.0%) | NPV (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 1,090.0 | 3.30% | 36.0 | **0.0** | 0.0 | 36.0 | - | - |
| **2025** | 1,035.5 | 4.00% | 41.4 | 36.0 | 1.8 | **43.2** | 0.909 | 39.3 |
| **2026** | 1,087.3 | 4.50% | 48.9 | 79.2 | 4.0 | **52.9** | 0.826 | 43.7 |
| **2027** | 1,174.3 | 5.00% | 58.7 | 132.1 | 6.6 | **65.3** | 0.751 | 49.0 |
| **2028** | 1,256.5 | 5.50% | 69.1 | 197.4 | 9.9 | **79.0** | 0.683 | 54.0 |
| **2029** | 1,332.9 | 6.00% | 79.0 | 276.4 | 13.8 | **92.8** | 0.621 | 57.6 |
| **2030** | 1,399.5 | 6.50% | 91.0 | 369.2 | 18.5 | **109.5** | 0.564 | 61.8 |

*   **2025 Accumulated Cash:** FY 2024 Net Income, \$36.0M.
*   **2025 ROIC Add. Income:** \$36.0M * 5.0% = \$1.8M.
*   **2026 Accumulated Cash:** \$36.0M (2024 NI) + \$43.2M (2025 CF) = \$79.2M.
*   *...and so on.*

**Terminal Value Calculation:**

*   CF_2031 = CF_2030 * (1 + g) = \$109.5M * 1.02 = \$111.7M
*   Terminal Value (TV_2030) = \$111.7M / (0.10 - 0.02) = **\$1,396.3 Million**
*   NPV of TV (Discounted to present) = \$1,396.3M * (1 / (1 + 0.10)^6) = \$1,396.3M * 0.564 = **\$787.0 Million**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Cash Flows:**
NPV (2025-2030) = \$39.3M + \$43.7M + \$49.0M + \$54.0M + \$57.6M + \$61.8M = **\$305.4 Million**
Total NPV = NPV (2025-2030) + NPV of TV = \$305.4M + \$787.0M = **\$1,092.4 Million**

### **6. Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV (Equity Value)** | **\$1,092.4** |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$340.7 |
| **Total Debt** | -\$497.5 |
| **Net Equity Value (Intrinsic Value)** | **\$935.6** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 43.150575 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$21.68** |

### **7. Conclusion and Market Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: \$21.68**
**Current Market Price: \$12.88**

My calculated **Fair Value of \$21.68** is significantly higher than the **Current Market Price of \$12.88**.

**Justification for the Difference:**

The market is currently pricing Angi Inc. based on its recent history of **revenue decline, failed turnarounds, and low/inconsistent profitability**. The market's assumptions are:

1.  **Slower/No Turnaround Success:** The market does not fully believe the "return to growth in 2026" guidance or that the new business engine (consumer choice, proprietary volume) will deliver the efficiency and growth I've projected. The market is likely pricing in a near-term continuation of revenue declines or flat growth, with Net Income Margins remaining low (closer to the historical 3.30%) due to the high volatility and competitive intensity in the home services space.
2.  **Execution Risk:** Angi has a history of unfulfilled promises related to the integration of its platforms and growth strategies. The market is applying a heavy discount for the **execution risk** associated with the latest "strategic realignment."
3.  **High Discount Rate:** The market is implicitly using a much higher discount rate than my conservative 10.0%, or a much lower Terminal Growth Rate, to penalize the stock for its risk profile and high Beta.

**My Assumption vs. Market Assumption:**

My valuation is an **"S-curve turnaround" valuation**, which assumes the management's new strategy, specifically the focus on **high-margin proprietary volume and pro retention**, is successful.

*   **Key assumption gap:** I assume the company will successfully transition from a money-losing volume focus to a highly efficient marketplace, leading to a Net Income Margin expansion from 4.0% in 2025 to 6.5% in 2030. The market, by contrast, is likely assuming a margin plateau at or below 4.0% due to persistent S&M spending required to maintain relevance.

The difference in value suggests Angi is a **turnaround play** with an **attractive risk/reward profile** if the current management team executes their stated strategy successfully. The fair value is achievable only if the **Net Income Margin expansion** and **return to mid-single-digit revenue growth** materialize as projected based on their public guidance.
