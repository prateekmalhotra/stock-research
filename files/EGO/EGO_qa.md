## Business Summary

Eldorado Gold Corporation operates by exploring, developing, and running gold mines, primarily located in Canada, Turkey, Greece, and Romania. The core business model involves extracting raw ore, processing it into refined gold bars (bullion), and selling this commodity on the global market. Since gold is a universally traded asset, the corporation’s customers are typically specialized metal refiners, bullion dealers, and central banks worldwide (B2B). Revenue is almost exclusively driven by the daily global spot price of gold, meaning the company does not sell directly to individual consumers and its sales are heavily reliant on market pricing rather than unique product differentiation.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk is the volatile global price of gold, which directly determines the company's earnings, coupled with persistent high global inflation, which rapidly increases the operational costs required to extract the gold (labor, energy, and chemicals). In the long term, Eldorado faces substantial geopolitical risks concerning permitting delays and unfavorable regulatory changes, especially in politically sensitive areas like Turkey and Greece; these issues have historically caused severe project delays and financial losses. A key long-term threat is resource depletion, meaning the company must continually find and develop new, high-quality gold deposits to replace the material it mines each year, or its operations will eventually cease.

## Company History

Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO) is a Canadian-based, mid-tier gold and base metals mining company with a history spanning over three decades.

### **History of Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO): From Inception to Present**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Goal (1992 - Mid-1990s)**

1.  **Founding Purpose:** Eldorado Gold Corporation was first incorporated in Bermuda in April 1992, under the name 'Eldorado Corporation,' by a group of entrepreneurs who had previously worked together at Bema Gold.
2.  **Initial Goal:** The company’s first objective was to bring the La Colorada gold mining project in Mexico into commercial production, which they successfully achieved in 1994.
3.  **Renaming and Relocation:** In 1996, after successfully fending off a hostile takeover attempt, the company was renamed Eldorado Gold Corporation and moved its headquarters to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

#### **II. Early Headwinds and Strategic Re-Focus (Late 1990s - Early 2000s)**

4.  **Major Headwind (Gold Price Collapse):** The collapse of global gold prices in 1998 created a significant headwind for the new company, leading them to sell off their initial productive mines in Mexico (La Trinidad and La Colorada) between 1998 and 2000.
5.  **New Strategic Direction (Acquisitions):** The company pivoted its focus internationally, acquiring the São Bento mine in Brazil in 1996 and laying the groundwork for a major expansion into Turkey, where they acquired properties in the late 1990s.

#### **III. Growth and Geographic Expansion (Mid-2000s - Early 2010s)**

6.  **Flagship Turkish Operations:** Turkey became a core operating region when their Kışladağ mine began production in 2006, followed by the Efemçukuru mine in 2012, establishing Kışladağ as a key, high-producing asset.
7.  **Major Growth Project (Acquisition in Greece):** In 2011, Eldorado Gold made a strategic move to acquire European Goldfields, which gave them a major European footprint, including the high-potential mining projects in Greece: Skouries, Olympias, and Stratoni.
8.  **Asian Footprint:** The company also successfully developed and operated mines in China for a number of years, notably the Tanjianshan mine, which contributed significantly to their overall gold production.

#### **IV. Strategic Shift and Modern Challenges (Mid-2010s - Present)**

9.  **Strategic Solution (Asset Sale):** In 2016, Eldorado executed a major strategic shift by selling its Chinese assets for approximately \$900 million; this allowed the company to refocus its resources and capital on its high-growth projects in Turkey, Canada, and particularly Greece.
10. **Canadian Diversification:** In 2017, the company expanded its presence in North America by acquiring the high-grade Lamaque project in Quebec, Canada, further diversifying its operations across three continents.
11. **Significant Headwind (Skouries Project Delays):** The flagship Skouries copper-gold project in Greece has faced persistent headwinds, including government and permitting issues, and, more recently, challenges due to a tight construction labor market.
12. **The Problem of Cost Overruns:** These delays and labor issues led to multiple timeline pushbacks, shifting the expected first production to 2026, and significantly increasing the total capital cost of the project.
13. **Innovative Solution (Dry Stack Tailings):** To address environmental concerns and improve safety, the company is implementing an innovative technology called **dry stack tailings** at Skouries, which removes water from the mine waste and stores the dry material in a more stable, earth-like structure, eliminating the risk of a traditional wet dam failure.
14. **Strategic Tailwind (Copper Byproduct):** A major financial tailwind for the Skouries project is that the sale of the copper byproduct is expected to cover all the operating and sustaining costs, meaning the gold produced will essentially be "free cash flow" for the company.

#### **V. Current Goal and Future Outlook**

15. **Current Goal:** Today, Eldorado Gold operates as a mid-tier producer with operating mines in Turkey, Canada, and Greece, and its vision is to build a safe, sustainable, high-quality business that creates long-term value.
16. **Future Focus:** The company's future success is heavily tied to the successful, safe, and sustainable completion of the Skouries project, which is designed to be one of the lowest-cost gold and copper producers in the industry due to its co-product strategy.
17. **Overall Strategy:** The business works by continually exploring for new deposits, developing new mines (like Skouries), and running its existing operations effectively, all while managing geopolitical and commodity price fluctuations.

## Moat Analysis

Eldorado Gold Corporation's (EGO) moat is not based on technology or consumer brand loyalty, but on **owning a rare portfolio of large, long-life, and high-quality mineral deposits** in jurisdictions where establishing new mines is extremely difficult.

Here is an analysis of Eldorado Gold's moat:

### 1. Source of the Moat: Proprietary, World-Class Assets

*   **Irreplaceable Core Assets:** The most significant part of Eldorado Gold's moat is its ownership and control of its operating mines, particularly the Kassandra Mines in Greece (which include the developing Skouries project), and the Kışladağ and Efemçukuru mines in Turkey. These are long-life assets (mine lives measured in decades) that cannot be easily replicated.
*   **The Skouries Project:** This specific asset is a world-class, high-grade gold-copper porphyry deposit. It is projected to be so profitable due to its significant copper byproduct that its **All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) for gold are expected to be negative** over the life of the mine, giving it a phenomenal cost advantage compared to nearly every other gold miner.

### 2. Differentiation and Special Market Position

*   **Cost Advantage via Copper:** The massive copper content at the Skouries project is the key differentiator. Selling the copper concentrates provides a credit that is expected to completely offset the cost of mining the gold, positioning it as one of the lowest-cost gold producers globally on an equivalent-ounce basis.
*   **Geographic and Jurisdictional Expertise:** The company has spent decades successfully permitting and operating complex projects in countries like Greece and Turkey. Their ability to navigate the legal, political, and social challenges—which have caused other companies to fail—is a crucial, non-replicable "soft moat" that has allowed them to secure and develop these assets.
*   **Diversified Commodity Portfolio:** Beyond gold, the Skouries project will make the company a significant copper producer, providing diversification and exposure to the "critical minerals" market, which is a special position among mid-tier gold-focused companies.

### 3. Pricing Power and Customer Stickiness

*   **Pricing Power (Internal):** As a producer of a commodity (gold), Eldorado Gold has **no special pricing power** over the market price of its primary product. However, its high-quality, low-cost mines—especially Skouries with its negative expected AISC—translate into a massive internal margin advantage. This structural cost leadership allows the company to remain profitable even when the gold price falls low enough to drive competitors out of business.
*   **Customer Contracts:** The company's final product (gold doré and gold/base metal concentrate) is a commodity. Customers (like smelters or refineries) are **not sticky and contracts are generally short-term**, as the buyer will seek the best price for the concentrate they process. The stickiness is in the **irreplaceable supply** (the mine) that only Eldorado owns. The company's success is about obtaining the *best possible terms* for its concentrate sales, which it has done by getting multiple tenders from buyers.

### 4. Ease of Displacement and Barriers to Entry

*   **High Capital and Time Barriers:** Eldorado Gold is extremely hard to displace. A rival with more capital would still have to find an equally high-quality gold deposit and then spend an enormous amount of time and capital (hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars) over a decade or more to navigate the rigorous permitting process, build the mine infrastructure, and secure the necessary government agreements. The long and complex history of the Skouries project itself highlights this massive barrier to entry.
*   **Regulated Monopoly:** Mining is essentially a regulated local monopoly. The government grants a specific company the right to extract minerals from a specific area, and no amount of capital can acquire a new license for the same land. This ownership of the mining concession itself forms a near-perfect barrier against displacement.

### 5. Historical Growth, R&D, and Innovation

*   **Reason for Growth:** Eldorado Gold grew through a strategy of **acquiring, holding, and developing high-potential mineral deposits in emerging mining jurisdictions**. The acquisition of European Goldfields in 2011, which owned the Kassandra Mines, was a pivotal moment, committing the company to the high-growth potential but complex permitting landscape of Greece.
*   **R&D and Innovation:** The company's "innovation" is less about new technology and more about **process, engineering, and sustainable practices** to make complex ore bodies profitable and environmentally acceptable. For instance, the choice to use **dry stack tailings** at Skouries, a more sustainable and less risky method for waste storage, demonstrates a commitment to engineering solutions that mitigate environmental risks and improve long-term community relations. They also invest in training and optimizing mining methods to reduce long-term operating costs.
*   **Network Effects:** Traditional network effects (like Facebook or eBay) do not apply to mining. However, the closest equivalent is their **long-term network of relationships and social license to operate** with local communities, government ministries, and regulators in their key jurisdictions. This sustained effort is what allows projects like Skouries to finally advance after years of legal and political friction.

## Catalyst Analysis

The catalysts that could increase Eldorado Gold Corporation's (EGO) stock price in the near and long term are centered on major project development, operational improvements, and the strong gold and copper market.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)

1.  **Stronger Second Half Production:** Management forecasts a stronger second half for their annual production, with a significant expected increase in gold output compared to the first half of the year.
2.  **Higher Gold Price Environment:** Sustained high and potentially rising gold prices are driving increased revenue and cash flow, as seen in recent quarterly results where higher prices offset increased production costs.
3.  **Skouries Project Milestones:** Continued positive updates on the construction progress of the Skouries copper-gold project in Greece, with the project being on track for first copper-gold concentrate production in early 2026.
4.  **Operational Performance Improvement:** The company is showing successful efforts to stabilize and improve production at key mines, such as the significant gold production recovery and cost reduction achieved at the Olympias mine in Q2 2025.
5.  **Shareholder Value Program:** The company's expanded Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB), a form of share buyback, signals management's confidence and is a direct method to return value to shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)

1.  **Skouries Commercial Production:** The biggest long-term catalyst is the start of commercial production at the Skouries project, expected in Q1 2026, which will introduce a significant new source of copper and gold revenue.
2.  **Portfolio Diversification and Growth:** Skouries will transform Eldorado Gold into a diversified gold and copper producer, substantially increasing the company's overall production volume, cash flow, and asset quality.
3.  **New Reserve Declaration:** The expected inaugural declaration of a gold reserve at the Ormaque deposit in Quebec, Canada, would add proven resources and extend the life and value of its Lamaque Complex.
4.  **Cost Management and Efficiency:** Efforts to manage inflationary pressures, such as the gradual transition to battery electric trucks at the Kışladağ mine, are aimed at reducing diesel dependency and lowering long-term operating costs.

### Management's Explicit Strategy and Catalysts from Earnings Calls

Management's strategy, as highlighted in recent earnings calls, is heavily focused on the growth of the company.

*   **Skouries Development as a Priority:** Management is prioritizing capital expenditure on the Skouries project, aiming for growth even if it results in temporary negative free cash flow, believing this investment will pay off significantly in the future.
*   **Returning Value to Shareholders:** The decision to expand the Normal Course Issuer Bid is explicitly stated as a move to enhance shareholder value and reflects confidence in the company's financial strength and long-term prospects.
*   **Focus on Operational Execution:** The company's goal for 2024 and 2025 is to meet its production and cost guidance through operational improvements at its current mines (Kışladağ, Lamaque, Efemcukuru, and Olympias).
*   **Strategy to Counter Inflation:** Management is actively addressing inflation in labor, fuel, and royalties by seeking operational efficiencies and benefiting from the strong realized gold price.

## Management Record

Based on a review of Eldorado Gold Corporation's (EGO) management, here is an analysis of its leadership, track record, and future strategy relevant to an investor.

### **Current Executive Leadership and Background**

1.  **Chief Executive Officer (CEO) - George Burns:** Mr. Burns was appointed President & CEO in April 2017 and has a long tenure, having joined Eldorado Gold in February 2017. He will transition to the sole role of CEO on September 12, 2025, as part of a planned succession.
2.  **Executive Experience:** Mr. Burns has over 40 years of experience in the mineral sector, including operations, development, and engineering roles. Prior to joining Eldorado, he was an Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Goldcorp Inc., one of the world's largest gold producers.
3.  **Key Senior Appointment/Succession:** In September 2025, **Christian Milau** was appointed President, overseeing operations in Canada and Türkiye, Technical Services, Exploration, and Finance. Milau is a mining veteran who previously served as CEO of Equinox Gold, where he led the company through significant growth from a single-asset developer to a multi-mine producer.
4.  **Management Tenure & Incentives:** The average tenure of the management team is relatively short at around two years, suggesting a recently reorganized team, but the CEO's tenure is over eight years. Executive officers are required to hold equity equivalent to at least two times their annual base salary to align with shareholder interests.

### **Previous Management and Transition**

5.  **Previous CEO and Transition:** George Burns succeeded **Paul Wright**, who retired in April 2017 after a 17-year tenure leading the company. This was a planned succession, with Mr. Wright moving to the Chairman position temporarily.
6.  **Context of Change:** Wright’s departure followed a period of intense activity where the company had grown into an international gold company. The transition was framed as a shift in leadership to support the company’s new strategy of focusing on delivering production and earnings growth.

### **Track Record and Delivery on Promises**

7.  **Operational Performance (Current Mines):** Management has demonstrated an ability to meet production and cost targets at its operating mines. For instance, in 2023, the company delivered 7% production growth and lowered all-in sustaining costs (AISC) by 4% to a competitive $1,229/oz, amidst a challenging inflationary environment.
8.  **Project Delivery (Skouries Project - Mixed Record):** The Skouries copper-gold project in Greece is the company's most significant growth initiative, but its timeline has seen slippage. Initial production was originally anticipated for mid-2025, but was first delayed to Q3/Q4 2025 and is now expected in Q1 2026, with commercial production anticipated mid-2026.
9.  **Capital Expenditure Control (Skouries Project - Mixed Record):** The initial capital cost to complete Skouries was estimated at $845 million (Dec 2021 Feasibility Study). This estimate was subsequently raised to $920 million (Feb 2024), due to higher labor rates and contract negotiation time, indicating a cost overrun on the major development project.
10. **Key Strategic Decisions:** A significant success under Burns' leadership was securing a €680-million project financing facility and a C$81.5-million strategic investment to fully fund the Skouries project, which significantly de-risked the asset for shareholders.

### **Future Strategy, Vision, and Popularity**

11. **Corporate Vision:** The company's vision is to build a safe, sustainable, high-quality business in the gold mining sector, creating value for current and future generations.
12. **Future Strategy:** The strategy is built on four key pillars: **Safety & Sustainability**, **Operational & Project Excellence**, **People & Capabilities**, and **Financial Strength & Returns**. The primary objective is to advance its high-quality asset portfolio to deliver production growth of over 45% by 2027.
13. **Value Creation & Copper Focus:** The Skouries project is a key component, with copper revenue expected to cover all operational and sustaining capital costs, making the gold production essentially a source of free cash flow. Management views copper as a strategic mineral, especially in Europe, positioning the company for long-term growth.
14. **Investor Sentiment (Popularity):** Analyst coverage, such as from RBC Capital, has an "Outperform" rating, anticipating a "significant potential for Eldorado Gold's stock to be re-rated" as Skouries nears completion. The stock experienced a strong increase in 2025, rising over 50% on gold momentum and positive Skouries expectations, and is seen as undervalued relative to the industry average.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Eldorado Gold Corporation's (EGO) public filings, primarily the Management Proxy Circulars, here is an analysis of their management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation for Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO)**

1.  **Strong Alignment to Equity and Performance:** Eldorado Gold's executive compensation program is structured to align management and shareholder interests by allocating a significant portion of total compensation to equity. For the CEO, George Burns, approximately 79.6% of his total compensation is comprised of bonuses, company stock, and options, while only about 20.4% is base salary. This heavy reliance on variable, performance-based pay suggests that a substantial part of their potential earnings is tied to the company's success.

2.  **Substantial Executive Ownership:** The CEO, George Burns, has a direct financial stake in the company's market performance, holding shares valued at approximately CA\$21.78 million (or CA\$15 million, depending on the report). This high-value ownership, while representing 0.27% of the total shares, indicates a deep personal investment that incentivizes a long-term focus on share price appreciation.

3.  **High Share Ownership Requirements:** The company enforces an Equity Ownership Policy that requires the CEO to hold a significant amount of the company's stock. In 2024, this requirement was increased from three times to **four times the CEO's base salary**, which forces the executive to maintain a high personal exposure to shareholder returns.

4.  **Long-Term Performance Focus:** A key component of the compensation is the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which utilizes Performance Share Units (PSUs) with a three-year performance period. The use of multi-year equity awards inherently motivates management to focus on sustainable, long-term value creation rather than short-term gains.

5.  **Incorporation of ESG Metrics:** The compensation structure includes non-financial metrics, as demonstrated by the 2024 addition of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation target to the PSU scorecard, which represents 10% of the award. This inclusion suggests an incentive for responsible and sustainable business practices, which is generally viewed as a factor in long-term company value and risk mitigation.

6.  **Mitigation of Misconduct Risk:** The company maintains an Executive Compensation Recovery Policy, often known as a "Clawback Policy," which allows the company to recover incentive-based compensation. This measure acts as a financial deterrent against misconduct and inappropriate risk-taking that could harm the company and its shareholders.

### **Conclusion on Management Incentive**

**Eldorado Gold Corporation's management appears to have a strong incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.** The compensation structure is heavily weighted toward variable, equity-based compensation tied to multi-year performance, with the CEO's pay being 79.6% non-salary. Furthermore, the significant share ownership requirement (four times base salary) and the CEO's substantial personal holding demonstrate a direct and sustained financial alignment with the company's long-term stock performance. The inclusion of a robust Clawback Policy and a long-term performance focus via PSUs suggests a well-governed structure designed to promote shareholder value over merely lining executive pockets.

## Long Thesis

Eldorado Gold is set up for significant growth and a major re-rating due to two factors: high gold prices now, and a massive project coming online soon. In the near term, the company is enjoying a substantial boost in cash flow thanks to record high global gold prices. Management is using this strength to improve current operations and conduct share buybacks, which signals confidence. The major long-term driver is the completion of the Skouries project in Greece (expected to start commercial production in early 2026). Skouries is a uniquely valuable mine because it produces both gold and copper. The revenue from selling the copper is expected to fully offset all the costs associated with running the mine. This means the large amount of gold produced from Skouries will essentially become pure profit for the company. Once Skouries is fully operational, it will dramatically increase the company's overall production capacity by over 45% and position Eldorado Gold as one of the lowest-cost gold producers globally, justifying a much higher stock price valuation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the Skouries gold-copper mine in Greece must be completed on schedule (early 2026) and within the recently revised budget. Furthermore, the global prices for both gold and copper must remain high or increase, ensuring that the critical copper byproduct continues to cover the mine's operational costs. We must also assume that ongoing geopolitical and regulatory challenges in key operating regions, particularly Greece and Turkey, do not lead to significant operational disruptions or new taxes that could negatively impact cash flow.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO) is primarily challenged by execution risk at its flagship project, cost inflation across its existing portfolio, and overreliance on a highly favorable (and somewhat historical) cost-offset metric.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **Skouries Project Execution Risk and Cost Overruns Are Already Materializing.**
    *   The primary assumption that the project will be completed "on schedule (early 2026)" and "within the recently revised budget" is flawed, as the latest updates now expect commercial production in **mid-2026**, representing a project delay.
    *   The total project capital cost has been revised upward to **$1.06 billion** (a 15.5% increase) plus an additional **$154 million** in accelerated operational capital, which directly contradicts the assumption of staying within budget.

2.  **The "Lowest-Cost Producer" Claim is Fragile and Based on Old Metrics.**
    *   The thesis's cornerstone—that copper revenue will "fully offset all costs" to make gold "pure profit"—relies on a historical feasibility study that projected a highly aggressive negative All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) of $\$(17)$ per ounce of gold over the life of the mine (LOM).
    *   The company's overall current AISC is much higher (reported at \$1,538/oz in Q2 2025), and there are ongoing cost pressures from structural inflation, particularly in the Turkey operations, which challenges the near-term cash flow narrative and the claim of becoming "one of the lowest-cost gold producers globally" for the entire company.

3.  **Geopolitical and Jurisdictional Risk is Understated.**
    *   The assumption that "geopolitical and regulatory challenges... do not lead to significant operational disruptions" dismisses the project's history; the Skouries project has faced multiple past halts, regulatory lawsuits, and strong local opposition in Greece, creating recurring, high-impact risks for the future.
    *   The reliance on non-Greek operations, such as those in Turkey, introduces country-specific risks like high labor inflation and currency volatility, which are already driving up current operating costs.

4.  **High Copper Price Exposure Creates Significant Revenue Volatility.**
    *   While high copper prices support the thesis now, the extraordinary margin is critically dependent on sustained, high copper prices. A sudden or cyclical downturn in the volatile copper market could rapidly undermine the projected "pure profit" from gold, negating the entire low-cost producer advantage.

---

### **Bear Case Thesis for Eldorado Gold Corporation (EGO)**

The core bull case is undermined by persistent execution risk and cost creep, high non-Skouries operating costs, and exposure to a volatile operating environment, making the expected re-rating premature and highly speculative.

1.  **Flagship Project Delivery is Constantly Delayed and Over-Budget:** The repeated delays (commercial production now expected mid-2026) and substantial capital cost overruns (over $\text{\$1.2}$ billion total in capital and accelerated operational costs) demonstrate poor project execution and continue to tie up capital, delaying the significant Free Cash Flow (FCF) inflection point promised by the bull case.
2.  **Cost Structure is More Vulnerable Than Advertised:** The reliance on the negative All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) from the Skouries feasibility study fails to account for the current high and rising AISC of the legacy assets (e.g., Q2 2025 AISC of $\text{\$1,538/oz}$). The company-wide margin remains exposed to structural inflation in key jurisdictions like Turkey, which could erode the overall expected benefit from Skouries' low operating costs.
3.  **Long-Term Regulatory Risk Remains Unresolved:** Eldorado's Greek assets, particularly Skouries, face persistent, high-profile environmental and political opposition, which creates a standing threat of future work stoppages, legal battles, or adverse regulatory changes that could further delay the ramp-up or reduce the mine's lifespan.
4.  **Value is Front-Loaded in an Uncertain Single Asset:** The vast majority of the company's valuation upside is contingent on the flawless ramp-up of the highly complex Skouries project, which has yet to prove its operational viability at commercial scale. Any initial production or operational hiccups during the ramp-up phase will be amplified, triggering a sharp de-rating due to the single-asset concentration of growth.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your thorough analysis, the most critical next steps should focus on the core conflicts between the Long Thesis and the Bear Scenario, which revolve entirely around the execution risk, cost structure, and valuation of the Skouries project.

Here are the most important questions still left unanswered that you should investigate further:

### **I. Project Execution Risk (Skouries) - *The Decisive Factor***

1.  **Quantify Skouries' Physical Progress and Risk:** What is the most recent, explicit percentage completion of the Skouries construction project (e.g., *75% complete*) and what specific critical path items (e.g., tailings filtration plant, power connection) remain? *Investigating this moves beyond general "updates" to a quantifiable assessment of the project's true risk of further delay or cost overrun.*
2.  **Analyze the True Impact of the Capital Cost Increase:** Break down the recent capital cost increase of \$215 million (from \$845M to \$1.06B plus accelerated operational costs) by cause (e.g., labor rates, material inflation, engineering changes). *Understanding the root cause will indicate if the issue is a one-time reset or a symptom of ongoing project management issues.*

### **II. Financial & Valuation Stress Test - *The Copper Assumption***

3.  **Stress-Test the "Negative AISC" Assumption with Current Prices:** What is the current market price and the consensus 1-3 year forecast for copper? *The entire long thesis hinges on sustained high copper prices to cover operational costs; this assumption must be tested against current market projections.*
4.  **Compare Legacy Asset Costs to Peers:** How does the All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) of Eldorado Gold’s non-Skouries operations (Turkey and Canada), which was reported at \$1,538/oz in Q2 2025, compare to the peer average for other mid-tier gold miners? *This will confirm or refute the Bear Case claim that the existing cost structure is high and vulnerable to inflation.*
5.  **Determine the Implied Skouries Valuation:** What is the company's current Enterprise Value (EV), and how does its EV-to-Resource (or EV/EBITDA multiple) compare to its peers? *This comparison will clarify if the market has already "re-rated" EGO for the successful completion of Skouries, or if the stock truly remains "undervalued" as analysts suggest.*

### **III. Geopolitical and Operational Risk - *Jurisdictional Volatility***

6.  **Assess Recent Geopolitical Risk in Greece and Turkey:** Has there been any specific, recent political, regulatory, or tax-related news (in the last 6-12 months) in Greece or Turkey that could impact EGO’s permits, royalties, or community relations? *This investigates whether the historical risk is escalating into a near-term operational threat to the company’s cash flow.*
7.  **Evaluate Ormaque's Impact on the Canadian Portfolio:** Investigate the expected scale and grade of the upcoming Ormaque reserve declaration and its potential life-of-mine extension for the Lamaque Complex. *This assesses the non-Skouries, non-Turkey growth potential and its ability to act as a further diversification and risk mitigation strategy.*
