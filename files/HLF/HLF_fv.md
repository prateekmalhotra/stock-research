## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Herbalife's business is driven by the recruitment and retention of its distributors and preferred members, coupled with pricing adjustments. Management commentary emphasizes a stabilization and return to constant currency growth, driven by an uptick in new distributors.

*   **Business Engine Inputs:**
    *   **New Distributor Growth:** New distributors were up 16% year-over-year in Q1 2025, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. This is a strong, positive metric for future sales.
    *   **Constant Currency Sales Growth:** The company has been posting modest but consistent constant currency net sales growth (Q1 2025: +1.4%; Q3 2025: +3.2%; Q4 2025 Guidance: +0.5% to +4.5%).
    *   **Pricing/Volume:** Favorable pricing has more than offset volume declines in the past, demonstrating some pricing power.

*   **Conservative Revenue Assumptions:**
    *   **FY 2025 (E):** The full year 2025 is expected to stabilize. Assuming the constant currency guidance trend continues (mid-point of Q4 guidance is $2.5\%$). We take the FY2024 Revenue ($5,000.0) and assume a modest **+2.0%** constant currency growth for the full year 2025, assuming a neutral impact from currency headwind/tailwind on a reported basis (which is a conservative simplification of a volatile variable).
    *   **FY 2026 - 2030 (E):** The long-term challenge of the multi-level marketing model and competitive health & wellness landscape necessitates a conservative growth projection. We will assume the constant currency growth rate slowly declines as base revenue increases and new distributor growth slows from its current peak.

| Year | Revenue Start | Growth Assumption | Revenue Projection | Justification (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | N/A | N/A | **5,000.0** (Actual) | |
| **2025 (E)** | 5,000.0 | **+2.0%** | **5,100.0** | Reflects management's guidance on constant currency growth (mid-single digits or less) and new distributor momentum. |
| **2026 (E)** | 5,100.0 | **+1.8%** | **5,191.8** | Modest deceleration from the initial rebound. |
| **2027 (E)** | 5,191.8 | **+1.5%** | **5,269.7** | Long-term constant currency growth rate for a mature MLM/direct sales company. |
| **2028 (E)** | 5,269.7 | **+1.2%** | **5,332.4** | Further slow-down as macro environment/competition weighs. |
| **2029 (E)** | 5,332.4 | **+1.0%** | **5,385.7** | Approaching long-term mature growth rate. |
| **2030 (E)** | 5,385.7 | **+1.0%** | **5,439.6** | Stable, conservative long-term growth. |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections (2025-2030)

*   **Net Income Margin Assumption:**
    *   FY 2024 Net Margin was **5.1%**.
    *   Management's key focus is on reducing debt (leverage ratio down to 2.8x by Q3 2025). This, over time, should reduce high interest expense, which will improve Net Income margin even if gross and operating margins remain stable.
    *   We will assume a slight, conservative improvement in Net Income margin, driven by lower interest expense and cost-saving initiatives.
    *   **Tax Rate:** Management guided a 27-28% adjusted effective tax rate for FY 2025. We will use **27.5%** for all years.

| Year | Revenue (E) | Net Income Margin Assumption | Net Income (before ROIC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | 5,100.0 | 5.3% | **270.3** |
| **2026 (E)** | 5,191.8 | 5.5% | **285.5** |
| **2027 (E)** | 5,269.7 | 5.6% | **295.1** |
| **2028 (E)** | 5,332.4 | 5.7% | **303.9** |
| **2029 (E)** | 5,385.7 | 5.7% | **307.0** |
| **2030 (E)** | 5,439.6 | 5.8% | **315.5** |

## 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Cash Flow

*   **ROIC Assumption:** Herbalife has a large shareholders' deficit, which complicates the calculation of a standard ROIC. However, a prudent valuation must assume a positive, albeit conservative, return on cash that the company retains.
    *   **Conservative ROIC:** We assume a conservative reinvestment/return rate of **3.0%** on the accumulated cash from prior-year net income.

*   **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**
    *   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** Given the high debt and volatility of the business, a high-risk premium is warranted. We use a discount rate of **10.0%**.
    *   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** The Perpetual Growth Rate, representing growth after 2030, is set at a conservative rate of **1.0%** (the same as the final projected revenue growth rate).

### Projected Net Income and NPV

Net Income = Net Income (Projected) + (Accumulated Prior-Year Cash \* ROIC)

| Year | Net Income (Projected) | Accumulated Prior-Year Cash | ROIC Income (3.0%) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 270.3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | **270.3** | 0.909 | 245.7 |
| **2026** | 285.5 | 270.3 | 8.1 | **293.6** | 0.826 | 242.3 |
| **2027** | 295.1 | 563.9 | 16.9 | **312.0** | 0.751 | 234.3 |
| **2028** | 303.9 | 875.9 | 26.3 | **330.2** | 0.683 | 225.4 |
| **2029** | 307.0 | 1,206.1 | 36.2 | **343.2** | 0.621 | 213.1 |
| **2030** | 315.5 | 1,549.3 | 46.5 | **362.0** | 0.564 | 204.1 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | | | | **1,364.9** |

### Terminal Value Calculation

Terminal Value (TV) = [2030 Cash Flow \* (1 + Perpetual Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)

*   TV = [362.0 \* (1 + 0.01)] / (0.10 - 0.01)
*   TV = 365.62 / 0.09 = 4,062.44
*   TV NPV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^(Year) = 4,062.44 / (1.10)^6 = **2,293.2**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Firm's Operations** = 1,364.9 + 2,293.2 = **3,658.1**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

Fair Value of Equity = (Total NPV of Future Cash Flows + Current Cash) - Total Debt

*   **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows:** $3,658.1
*   **Current Cash:** $305.5
*   **Total Debt:** $2,017.9

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enterprise Value (NPV + Cash)** | 3,658.1 + 305.5 = **3,963.6** |
| **Equity Value** | 3,963.6 - 2,017.9 = **1,945.7** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **103.2 million** |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $1,945.7 / 103.2 = **$18.85** |

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) Stock

**Fair Value Per Share: $18.85**

**Current Market Price: $15.90**

### Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated Fair Value of **$18.85** is approximately **18.6% higher** than the current market price of $15.90. This suggests that the market is making more pessimistic assumptions about the company's future performance or its ability to service its debt than those used in this conservative DCF model.

| Assumption | Valuation Model Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption | Why the Difference? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (2025-2030)** | Slow, declining from +2.0% to +1.0% (Constant Currency growth). | Near-zero or Negative long-term growth. | The market is skeptical of the sustainability of the multi-level marketing model and the recent distributor growth (16% in Q1 2025). The market may believe currency headwinds and regulatory risk will permanently negate constant currency gains. |
| **Discount Rate (Risk)** | Conservative **10.0%**. | Likely higher than 10.0% (e.g., 12-14%). | Given the high Total Debt ($2.0B) and negative shareholder equity/high volatility, the market demands a higher rate of return (higher risk premium) to compensate for the significant financial risk. |
| **Net Income Margin** | Slight improvement from 5.1% to 5.8% due to debt/cost reduction. | Stable or declining margin due to rising selling costs (commissions) or inflation. | The market may not trust management's ability to significantly reduce interest expense in the near-term or believes the cost-saving initiatives will fail to outpace increasing distributor incentives/competition. |
| **Perpetual Growth** | Low **1.0%** (matching final growth). | A growth rate closer to **0%** or a lower multiple. | This is an often-debated point, and a 0% terminal growth rate would bring the Fair Value closer to the market price. The $1.0 \%$ reflects belief in *some* global inflation/volume expansion. |

**Reasoning for the Calculated Fair Value ($18.85):**

The calculated fair value is higher because the model gives weight to the recent positive fundamental metrics cited by management (fourth consecutive quarter of new distributor growth, constant currency sales growth, and significant debt leverage reduction to 2.8x). By projecting even a very modest 1-2% long-term revenue growth and a marginal improvement in net margin (due to debt management), the DCF framework suggests a higher intrinsic value.

**The Market's Primary Concern:**

The market is likely applying a higher discount rate and a more pessimistic long-term growth rate due to the company's historical volatility, the high debt load, and the inherent business model risk of multi-level marketing (MLM), which is perpetually subject to regulatory and legal scrutiny. For the stock to trade at $15.90, the market is essentially assuming a worst-case scenario where net income growth is minimal and the cost of equity is substantial. **If the market's high discount rate is closer to 12.0% and the Perpetual Growth Rate is 0.0%, the Fair Value would fall to approximately $14.90, much closer to the current market price.** This indicates the market is factoring in significant regulatory/business model risk.
