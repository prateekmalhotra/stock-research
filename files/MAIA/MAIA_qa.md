## Business Summary

MAIA Biotechnology is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel treatments for cancer. The company does not currently sell products; instead, its core business model centers on research and development (R&D), using capital raised from investors to test its lead drug candidates, such as THIO, through rigorous clinical trials. The primary goal is to prove the drug is safe and effective. If successful, the company plans to monetize the drug by entering into licensing agreements or partnerships with much larger pharmaceutical firms (Big Pharma). These partners would pay MAIA upfront fees, milestone payments as the drug progresses, and royalties on future sales, allowing the partner to handle the global manufacturing and distribution. Since the company is pre-revenue, its immediate financial stability depends entirely on securing continuous funding from investors.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant immediate risk is clinical trial failure. Historically, the vast majority of promising drugs fail during development due to lack of effectiveness or unforeseen safety issues. If MAIA's lead candidate, THIO, fails to meet expectations in ongoing trials, the company's valuation and viability would be immediately jeopardized. Furthermore, the company faces high cash burn and constant funding risk. Developing drugs is extremely expensive, and the company must repeatedly raise capital from the market—often by selling new shares, which dilutes (reduces) the value held by existing shareholders. This threat of needing constant financing is a common, historical risk for all small biotech firms. A critical long-term risk involves commercial viability and competition. Even if MAIA secures regulatory approval, larger companies are constantly developing next-generation cancer therapies. If a competitor introduces a better treatment first, MAIA’s drug could become obsolete before it generates significant revenue. Finally, the entire business hinges on the protection of its intellectual property (patents); if these patents are successfully challenged or expire, competition could quickly erode market position and future earnings.

## Company History

This is a detailed, jargon-free history lesson of MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (MAIA), a company focused on developing new treatments for hard-to-cure cancers.

### **The Inception and Core Goal of MAIA Biotechnology**

1.  **Inception (2018):** MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. was formally incorporated in Delaware in August 2018, marking the start of its journey as a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.
2.  **The Founding Goal (Why the Business Was Founded):** The company was founded with the mission to develop and deliver highly innovative medicines for cancer, specifically focusing on a new area called "targeted therapy" and "immuno-oncology."
3.  **The Problem They Sought to Solve:** Existing cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and a newer class of drugs called "immune checkpoint inhibitors," often fail in late-stage or highly resistant cancers, leaving patients with few viable options. MAIA aimed to find a solution for these hard-to-treat patients.
4.  **The Core Innovation (The Solution):** MAIA's strategy centered on developing a "first-in-class" drug named **ateganosine (THIO)**, which uses a unique, dual mechanism of action.

### **The Innovative Solution: THIO's Dual Mechanism**

5.  **Targeting the "Immortal" Cancer Cell:** The first part of THIO’s mechanism targets telomeres—the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that cancer cells use to become "immortal" and divide endlessly. THIO disrupts these telomeres, causing the cancer cell to die, unlike many drugs that only try to slow growth.
6.  **Activating the Immune System:** The second, crucial part of the innovation is that when THIO breaks apart the cancer cell’s core structures, it sends out "danger signals" that awaken the patient’s dormant immune system. This process is called "immunogenicity."
7.  **The Combination Strategy:** MAIA’s clinical approach is to first treat the patient with THIO to break down the cancer and make it visible to the immune system, and *then* follow up a few days later with a powerful existing drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor (like cemiplimab) to boost the immune response, leading to a much stronger and longer-lasting effect.

### **Headwinds and Strategic Solutions (2018–2022)**

8.  **The Headwind of Funding:** As is common for early-stage biotech, MAIA faced the continuous challenge of raising significant capital to run expensive clinical trials and operate without any product sales revenue.
9.  **The Solution of Strategic Partnership (Tailwind):** In February 2021, MAIA secured a crucial **Clinical Supply Agreement** with the major pharmaceutical company, Regeneron. This agreement allowed MAIA to receive the expensive immune checkpoint inhibitor (cemiplimab/Libtayo®) at no cost for their main trial, which significantly reduced the company’s costs and validated its science.
10. **The Strategic Solution of Global Trials:** To move its lead drug forward efficiently, MAIA adopted a global development strategy. It established subsidiaries and began the pivotal Phase 2 THIO-101 trial in Australia and Europe in the first half of 2022, which can often allow for faster patient enrollment and data collection than starting only in the US.
11. **The Funding Solution (IPO Tailwind):** MAIA successfully completed an **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** on the NYSE American stock exchange on July 28, 2022, raising capital that was essential to fund the first part of their Phase 2 clinical trials and expand their research pipeline.

### **Present Day and Major Tailwinds (2023–Present)**

12. **Facing the Toughest Challenge:** MAIA focused its Phase 2 THIO-101 trial on patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who had already failed multiple previous treatments, including chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. This patient group represents a high unmet medical need.
13. **Exceptional Clinical Data (Major Tailwind):** Beginning in 2023 and continuing through 2025, MAIA released remarkably positive data from the THIO-101 trial. The median overall survival (OS) for these heavily pre-treated patients reached 17.8 months.
14. **Outperforming the Standard of Care:** This survival rate of 17.8 months is a massive tailwind, as it is nearly triple the 5 to 6 months of overall survival typically seen with standard-of-care chemotherapy for patients in this late stage of disease.
15. **Regulatory Advantage (Future Tailwind):** The exceptional results have positioned MAIA to pursue a **potential accelerated FDA approval** pathway, which could bring the drug to market faster than a typical drug approval timeline.
16. **Pipeline Expansion:** The company is now leveraging the success of THIO to advance a next-generation program and is also planning new trials to test THIO in other difficult-to-treat cancers like colorectal cancer.

## Moat Analysis

MAIA Biotechnology, Inc.'s "moat" is currently centered on its novel scientific approach and intellectual property, rather than traditional commercial factors like market share or pricing power, as it is a clinical-stage company with no commercial products yet.

### Analysis of MAIA Biotechnology, Inc.'s Moat

#### 1. Differentiation and Special Position in the Market

*   **First-in-Class Mechanism:** MAIA's lead product, **THIO** (ateganosine), is a potential "first-in-class" telomere-targeting agent, which is a key point of differentiation. It uses a unique approach by actively incorporating itself into the DNA of telomeres in cancer cells, damaging them and leading to selective cell death, which is a different and potentially superior mechanism compared to drugs that merely inhibit the telomerase enzyme.
*   **Addressing High Unmet Need:** The company is focusing its lead program on third-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are resistant to current standard-of-care, including chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). This focus addresses a large, critically underserved patient population.
*   **Promising Clinical Data:** Interim data from its Phase 2 trial (THIO-101) suggests that THIO, when sequenced with a CPI, has the potential to substantially outperform reported standard treatments in this difficult-to-treat patient group, providing a significant potential clinical edge.
*   **Regulatory Validation:** The FDA has granted **Fast Track designation** for THIO in NSCLC, and the drug also holds **Orphan Drug Designation** for other cancer indications, which helps to expedite the development and review process.

#### 2. Pricing Power and Market Position

*   **No Current Pricing Power:** As a clinical-stage biotechnology company, MAIA has no commercial revenue and is not currently profitable, meaning it does not yet have any pricing power. The ability to set a high price will depend entirely on a successful Phase 3 trial and regulatory approval, where its "first-in-class" status and strong clinical data in a resistant population could justify a premium price.
*   **Market Position is Potential, not Present:** The company does not have a special market position today, but it is building towards a **potential dominant position** in a sub-segment of NSCLC: the treatment of patients who are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

#### 3. Growth and Moat Creation

*   **Reason for Growth/Existence:** The company's existence and growth are solely driven by the potential of its scientific pipeline, particularly the initial positive and differentiated clinical results for THIO. The compelling data has allowed it to raise capital and enter into strategic collaborations, which is the necessary fuel for any early-stage biotech.
*   **Intellectual Property (Primary Moat):** The company's most crucial moat is its intellectual property, which includes patent applications protecting its telomere-targeting technology and the use of THIO in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. This protection provides a period of market exclusivity, which is the primary barrier to entry in the drug development industry.
*   **R&D and Constant Innovation:** MAIA invests significantly in R&D, with a substantial portion of its operating expenses dedicated to clinical trial activities and research. The company must **constantly innovate** by progressing its lead asset through clinical trials and developing second-generation compounds to maintain its edge and realize its potential value.

#### 4. Displacement Risk and Stickiness

*   **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** The company is highly susceptible to displacement or acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company because it is currently operating with a limited cash runway, and auditors have noted "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue without raising additional capital. A major pharmaceutical company with more capital could easily acquire MAIA's assets and expertise, or simply fund a competing drug if MAIA's clinical results lead the way.
*   **Customer/Contract Stickiness:** MAIA currently has no commercial customers, so there are no sticky or recurring contracts. Its current agreements are **clinical supply agreements** and collaborations with partners like Regeneron/Sanofi and BeiGene to advance its drug development, not revenue-generating customer contracts. Once the drug is approved and commercialized, the 'stickiness' will come from physicians continuing to prescribe the drug due to superior clinical outcomes in a challenging patient population.
*   **Network Effects/Ecosystem Advantage:** While traditional network effects do not apply, the company is creating an **ecosystem advantage** through its clinical collaborations. Partnering with major players for the supply of their checkpoint inhibitors (like Libtayo) not only validates MAIA's scientific approach but also streamlines the development path and provides access to resources and expertise.

## Catalyst Analysis

MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (MAIA) is a clinical-stage oncology company whose stock catalysts are primarily tied to the progress and regulatory outcomes of its lead drug candidate, **THIO (ateganosine)**, for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

Here are the key catalysts that could increase the stock price in the near and long term:

### **Management Strategy and Explicit Catalysts**

1.  **Accelerated Approval Pathway:** Management, led by CEO Vlad Vitoc, M.D., is pursuing multiple regulatory pathways, including an accelerated approval track for THIO in NSCLC. They explicitly stated that the goal is a potential FDA decision as early as 2026.

2.  **Strong Clinical Data Interpretation:** The CEO describes the median Overall Survival (OS) data from the Phase 2 trial (THIO-101) as a "substantial indicator of the potential ateganosine has to shift the NSCLC treatment landscape." This strong confidence in the drug's efficacy compared to standard care is a core part of their strategy and communication.

3.  **Phase 3 Trial Initiation:** Management has highlighted the upcoming initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 trial, THIO-104, in mid-2025 as a major milestone toward FDA commercial approval. This move to a large-scale, final-stage trial validates their belief in the drug's potential.

4.  **Pipeline Expansion and Partnerships:** The company's strategy involves expanding the THIO program to additional cancer types like hepatocellular carcinoma and small cell lung cancer, along with pursuing strategic collaborations, such as the clinical supply agreement with BeiGene.

***

### **Near-Term Catalysts (Next 6-12 Months)**

1.  **New Interim Clinical Data Presentation:** Further updates or the final data from the ongoing Phase 2 THIO-101 trial will be a significant catalyst, especially since the median Overall Survival (OS) reached 17.8 months, compared to 5-6 months for standard chemotherapy.

2.  **Phase 3 Trial Enrollment Start:** The official start of patient enrollment in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (THIO-104) is planned to begin in the second half of 2025 and will confirm the advancement of their lead program.

3.  **Regulatory Designations and Financial Support:** Positive developments like the existing FDA Fast Track Designation, which speeds up the review process for serious conditions, and any new grants or non-dilutive funding further de-risk the program.

***

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)**

1.  **Accelerated or Full FDA Approval Decision:** The most significant long-term catalyst would be a positive decision from the FDA, which management is targeting as early as 2026, leading to the commercialization of the drug.

2.  **Positive Phase 3 Trial Readout (THIO-104):** A successful outcome in the Phase 3 trial, especially if it confirms the overall survival benefit seen in Phase 2, is crucial for full market approval and will drive long-term value.

3.  **New Indication Success:** Positive initial data from trials expanding THIO into other cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC), will open up large new market opportunities.

4.  **Intellectual Property Development:** Success with their next-generation telomere-targeting agents, which are protected by new patent grants, could provide long-term exclusivity and a continuing product pipeline.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of MAIA Biotechnology, Inc.'s incentive and compensation disclosures, the following points detail the management alignment with shareholder interests.

### **I. Insider Ownership and Equity Incentives**

1.  **Equity-Focused Structure:** The company utilizes a **2021 Equity Incentive Plan** to attract and retain management and directors, suggesting that stock ownership is a central component of their total compensation.
2.  **Director Investment:** At least one director has recently engaged in share purchases, increasing their beneficial ownership to over 1.3 million shares, which indicates a substantial personal financial commitment to the company's success.
3.  **Insufficient Ownership Clarity (Quantitatively):** While the company tracks and discloses the beneficial ownership of "all executive officers and directors as a group," the total percentage is not readily available in the search results to gauge if their overall holding is "higher the better."

### **II. Compensation Structure and Alignment Issues**

1.  **Compensation Mix:** The compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is structured around three primary components: **Salary**, a **Non-Equity Incentive Plan** (cash bonus), and **Option Awards** (equity).
2.  **Immediate Vesting of Equity (Misalignment):** Certain stock options granted to directors were structured to **vest 100% immediately** upon the date of the grant. Immediate vesting significantly diminishes the incentive to act in the *long-term* interest of shareholders, as the value is secured without requiring sustained performance or continued tenure.
3.  **Discretionary Bonus Inflation (Misalignment):** For the 2023 performance-based cash bonus program, the Compensation Committee and Board increased the corporate goal achievement from an already high 115% to **120%** by factoring in performance considerations **not originally included** as goals. This discretionary, post-hoc increase weakens the integrity of the performance plan and raises concerns about rewarding executives without meeting pre-established, objective metrics.

### **III. Conclusion on Incentives**

1.  **Mixed Incentives:** Management has a financial incentive to see the stock price rise due to their significant Option Awards and existing beneficial ownership. However, the design of the compensation plan contains structural flaws that dilute this long-term alignment.
2.  **Weak Alignment with Long-Term Value:** The practice of granting **immediately vested options** to directors and the use of **discretionary factors to inflate cash bonuses** suggest that management and the Board are, in certain instances, incentivized to secure immediate financial benefit ("lining their own pockets") even if it bypasses the discipline of a strictly performance-aligned, multi-year vesting schedule or pre-set corporate goals.
3.  **Overall Assessment:** The presence of a significant equity component provides some incentive for stock appreciation, but the committee's willingness to exercise substantial discretion to boost pay and grant immediately vested equity suggests a compensation philosophy that is **not strictly aligned** with a robust, long-term, and performance-driven shareholder interest model.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (MAIA) price history and technical indicators as of the data available from early October 2025:

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock is trading at a price of \$1.73, significantly below its 52-week high of \$3.48 and closer to its 52-week low of \$1.40.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** MAIA is currently trading **23.57%** above its 52-week low of \$1.40.

3.  **Technical Analysis Assessment:** The stock is exhibiting mixed technical signals; while it holds "buy signals" from both short and long-term Moving Averages and sits above its 50-Day Moving Average (\$1.58), its Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 57.95 suggests a neutral momentum rather than being heavily oversold or "low" (which would typically be below 30).

4.  **Analyst Outlook:** The stock is far below the average analyst price target of **\$14.00**, representing a potential upside of over 700%, with a consensus rating of "Moderate Buy."

5.  **Big Upward Movement Drivers:** Recent positive movement was likely driven by clinical milestones, including an FDA Fast Track designation in July 2025, a \$2.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, and the publication of promising interim clinical data from its Phase 2 THIO-101 trial for non-small cell lung cancer.

6.  **Downward Pressure/Drops:** The stock has faced pressure, with one source noting a 41% decline validation of an "overvalued" call, and the company announcing recent private placements to raise capital, which often leads to dilution of existing shares and a temporary drop in price.

7.  **Long-Term Performance:** Despite a recent rise of over 15% in the last six months, the stock is still down over 31% in the last year, indicating significant volatility and a challenging broader trend within its 52-week cycle.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for MAIA centers entirely on its lead drug, THIO, which offers a powerful, unique solution for advanced lung cancer patients who have failed every other treatment. In near-term, this thesis is supported by exceptionally strong early clinical data from its Phase 2 trial, which showed that combining THIO with an immune drug led to patients surviving nearly three times longer (17.8 months) than they would on standard chemotherapy. This significant survival benefit justifies the company pursuing an accelerated path to market. The immediate value driver is the successful initiation of the final-stage (Phase 3) trial in mid-2025, which confirms the drug's potential. In the long-term, if the Phase 3 results hold up, MAIA is positioned to secure early FDA approval potentially as soon as 2026. This would allow them to either partner with a major drug company for lucrative payments or launch the drug themselves, addressing a major, underserved market. Success here provides the capital to expand THIO into other major cancers like liver and small cell lung cancer, securing MAIA's place as a leader in a new generation of targeted cancer therapy.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the outstanding survival benefit seen in the small Phase 2 trial will be successfully replicated in the much larger and more expensive Phase 3 trial. Second, MAIA must successfully secure the large amount of capital required to fund the Phase 3 trial without severely diluting existing shareholders. Third, the regulatory bodies (FDA) must agree to grant an accelerated approval based on the strong data. Finally, the company must successfully maintain its patent protection (intellectual property) to prevent larger competitors from quickly replicating the drug's mechanism or stealing its market share.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for MAIA Biotechnology, Inc. (MAIA) contains several significant holes and inherent risks, primarily centered on financial viability, clinical replication risk, and the regulatory pathway's true requirements.

## Bear Case Thesis: Holes and Faults in the MAIA Long Thesis

1.  **Imminent and Severe Financial Viability Risk (Dilution):** The primary assumption that MAIA can fund the expensive Phase 3 trial "without severely diluting existing shareholders" is highly unlikely to materialize. As of Q2 2025, MAIA reported only **\$10.14 million in cash**, while simultaneously reporting a cash burn rate of **\$8.34 million** for the preceding six months, leading to a filing disclosure of **"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year"** without additional financing. The cost of a 300-patient, multi-center pivotal Phase 3 trial is orders of magnitude greater than the company's current cash reserve, making a massive, dilutive capital raise a certainty.
2.  **Uncertainty of Phase 2 Data Replication:** The "exceptionally strong early clinical data" showing a 17.8 months median Overall Survival (OS) is based on a small cohort of only 22 patients in a Phase 2 trial. Crucially, the Phase 2 trial was **open-label** (not blinded), which can introduce bias that may inflate results compared to a rigorously blinded study. The bull case's central assumption—that this result will be successfully replicated in a much larger, randomized Phase 3 trial—represents a major clinical cliff risk.
3.  **High-Risk Phase 3 Comparator:** The pivotal Phase 3 trial (THIO-104) is designed to compare THIO + Checkpoint Inhibitor (CPI) against "investigator's choice of chemotherapy." While the company cites a 5-6 month OS benchmark for chemotherapy, this is often based on historical literature, not a head-to-head, modern comparator arm. There is a material risk that the control group's performance in a well-run, randomized trial could exceed the low historical benchmark, narrowing the OS benefit and failing to meet the primary endpoint.
4.  **Accelerated Approval Not Guaranteed:** Although the FDA granted **Fast Track designation**, this only *makes the drug eligible* for Accelerated Approval; it does not guarantee it. Accelerated Approval typically requires a clear demonstration of a substantial improvement on a surrogate endpoint (e.g., Overall Response Rate or Progression-Free Survival) that is *reasonably likely* to predict clinical benefit. Given the Phase 3 is planned for "early full approval" with Overall Survival as the primary endpoint, the path is less about speed and more about final, definitive data, making the projected 2026 approval overly optimistic and high-risk.
5.  **Long-Term Expansion and IP Dependency:** The long-term plan to expand THIO into other major cancers depends entirely on the financial success of the lead indication, which is undermined by the financial risks above. Furthermore, the IP strength is heavily reliant on patents covering the *sequential combination* of THIO with a CPI and next-generation compounds, rather than just the core THIO molecule itself, which could present future challenges for market exclusivity and partnering value if competitors find non-infringing combination methods.

---

## Next Steps

This is an exceptionally thorough analysis. The immediate and catastrophic financial risk has been directly quantified against the enormous cost of a pivotal trial, which is the single biggest overhang on the company. The clinical risk is clear (small, unblinded data must replicate in a large Phase 3).

Here are the most important, unanswered questions and next steps you should investigate to complete your due diligence, broken down by critical themes.

### **I. Deep Financial and Dilution Risk Modeling**

The core risk is not *if* MAIA will raise capital, but *how much* and at *what price*. The \$2.25M private placement only covers one step of Phase 2, not the \$20M–\$100M+ Phase 3 trial.

1.  **Quantify the Total Dilution:** Assuming MAIA needs **\$50 million** for the Phase 3 trial (a mid-range oncology estimate) and a stock price of **\$1.73** (current price), calculate the absolute minimum number of new shares that must be issued. This will translate the "dilution risk" into a concrete, alarming percentage of current outstanding shares.
2.  **Cash Runway Stress Test:** Given the \$8.34M/6-month cash burn, and the minimal recent raise, determine the exact month (Month X) the company is expected to run out of cash and be unable to execute the Phase 3 enrollment plan without a new raise or partnership.
3.  **Projected Partnering Payment:** Investigate typical upfront licensing payments for a Phase 3-ready, *first-in-class* oncology asset. This establishes the **minimum non-dilutive payment** MAIA needs to survive a year and begin the trial without major shareholder dilution.

### **II. Refining Clinical & Regulatory Risk**

The bull case hinges on the Phase 3 trial design. The biggest uncertainty is the **comparator arm** against which THIO must prove its value.

4.  **Investigator’s Choice Chemotherapy Scrutiny:** What *specific* chemotherapy regimens are investigators likely to choose in the 3rd-line NSCLC setting globally? Investigate the current, published Overall Survival (OS) data for *modern* docetaxel or pemetrexed-based regimens, not just the older 5–6 month historical benchmark, to assess the true risk of the control arm performing better than expected.
5.  **Impact of Open-Label Design:** The Phase 3 (THIO-104) is listed as **open-label** (the doctor and patient know which drug they are receiving), which can introduce bias. Find commentary or documentation on why management chose an open-label design for a pivotal OS study rather than a blinded one, and what specific statistical or regulatory measures they have in place to mitigate potential bias.
6.  **Full Data for All Patients in Phase 2:** The 17.8 months OS data was from a small cohort of 22 patients. Seek out the complete, updated Phase 2 data from a scientific conference (e.g., ASCO, ESMO) that includes data for *all* patients enrolled, not just the initial cohort, to confirm the 17.8-month figure remains robust.

### **III. Scrutinizing IP and Commercial Moat**

The company's core asset is its intellectual property. Its value is determined by its duration and breadth.

7.  **Identify Specific Patent Expiration Dates:** The core THIO license runs until **2038**, but the drug's value is in the **sequential combination strategy**. Try to find the specific expiration dates for the patents covering the *use of THIO in combination with a CPI*. This combination-therapy IP is the real commercial moat.
8.  **Competition for the Mechanism:** Are any larger biotech companies or research institutions currently working on *other* next-generation telomere-targeting agents that could leapfrog THIO or its next-gen analogues before MAIA can commercialize?

### **IV. Analyst Reality Check**

The \$14.00 price target is almost certainly based on a speculative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model assuming FDA success.

9.  **Identify Key Analyst Assumptions:** Find the published or consensus *assumptions* behind the dramatic analyst price targets (e.g., Cantor Fitzgerald, B. Riley Securities, etc.). Specifically, what **Probability of Success (PoS)** (e.g., 50% or 80%) for the Phase 3 trial and what **Peak Annual Sales** (e.g., \$500M or \$2B) are they modeling to arrive at a \$14 target? This will reveal how much risk is actually being factored into their valuation.
