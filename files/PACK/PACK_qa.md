## Management Incentive

Here's an analysis of Ranpak Holdings Corp.'s (PACK) management incentives and compensation:

1.  **Insider Ownership:**
    *   Insider ownership at Ranpak Holdings Corp. is around 6.84% to 9.66%. While this is not exceptionally high, it indicates some alignment between management and external shareholders.

2.  **Compensation Structure:**
    *   Ranpak's compensation structure for its Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is a mix of fixed and variable components. For NEOs other than the CEO, approximately 64% is fixed (salary, RSUs) and 36% is variable/at-risk (annual cash bonus, PRSUs). This structure ties a significant portion of compensation to performance.

3.  **CEO Compensation:**
    *   CEO Omar Asali's total compensation for 2024 was $2.15 million, a decrease of 17.8% from 2023.

His compensation is composed of salary, stock awards, and non-equity incentive plan compensation.

4.  **Incentive Alignment:**
    *   The company heavily utilizes Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA (AEBITDA) as the key performance metric for both annual cash bonuses and performance-based stock units (PRSUs). This suggests that a significant part of executive compensation is directly tied to operational performance.
    *   However, there are concerns regarding the effectiveness of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), as some performance-based stock units are projected to pay out at minimal levels or zero, which could indicate a disconnect between long-term goals and shareholder value creation.

5.  **Overall Conclusion:**
    *   Ranpak Holdings Corp. has a compensation structure that aims to align management interests with shareholder interests through performance-based bonuses and stock awards tied to specific financial metrics like AEBITDA. The presence of insider ownership, though modest, also contributes to this alignment. However, the underperformance of certain long-term incentive components and recent insider selling suggest that the alignment may not be perfect, and there could be areas where incentives are not fully driving long-term shareholder value.
