## Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB) Valuation

### **1. Initial Financial Data (as of September 30, 2025, or as noted)**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$123.6 | End of Fiscal Year 2025 Balance Sheet data. |
| **Total Debt** | \$581.4 | End of Fiscal Year 2025 Balance Sheet data (\$496.1M senior unsecured notes + \$85.3M finance leases). |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 23.38 Million | As of November 11, 2025. |
| **Current Stock Price** | \$67.00 | Approximate price based on search context. |
| **FY 2025 Net Sales (Baseline)** | \$2,815.0 | Calculated: FY2024 Revenue (\$2,970M) declined 5.2%. |
| **FY 2025 Net Income** | \$100.2 | Full Year Net Income from Continuing Operations. |
| **FY 2025 Net Income Margin** | 3.56% | Calculated: \$100.2M / \$2,815.0M |

### **2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

Spectrum Brands' business engine is currently focused on **Global Pet Care (GPC)** and **Home & Garden (H&G)**, which management refers to as its "highest value businesses." The company is mitigating the impact of trade policy issues (tariffs) through supply chain diversification, which significantly affected FY2025 results. A strategic solution (such as a spin-off) is being explored for the **Home & Personal Care (HPC)** business.

The valuation will be built on the following conservative assumptions:

| Metric | Assumption | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2026 Revenue Growth** | 1.0% | Conservative low-end of management's "Flat to Low Single-Digit Net Sales Growth" guidance for FY 2026. |
| **FY 2027 - 2030 Revenue Growth** | 2.0% annually | Assumes success in core GPC/H&G segments, tariff mitigation, and modest macroeconomic recovery, partially offset by the uncertainty and potential divestiture of the less-profitable HPC segment. This is a conservative, lower-than-GDP growth rate. |
| **Net Income Margin (Starting)** | 3.56% (FY2025) | Based on actual FY 2025 results. |
| **Net Income Margin (Long-Term)** | Gradual increase to 4.0% by FY 2030 | Assumes management's stated focus on cost improvement and operational efficiencies will lead to a modest 44 basis point margin expansion over five years, which is a conservative estimate given the core business focus. |
| **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** | 5.0% | Uses the conservative end of the historical ROIC range (5.0%-6.79%) for additional income generation. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | 1.0% | A very conservative "maturity rate," lower than long-term inflation and global GDP growth, reflecting the mature nature of the consumer staples industry. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | 9.0% | A conservative, but reasonable, discount rate (proxy for WACC) reflecting the company's efforts to reduce debt/leverage (Net Debt Leverage of 1.58x) and the moderate operational risks in the consumer products sector. |

### **3. Projected Financials and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**

The Net Income (Cash Flow to Equity) is calculated as:
$Net \text{ Income}_n = (\text{Net \text{ Income}} \text{ from Operations}_n) + (\text{Accumulated \text{ Cash} from } n-1 \times ROIC)$

| Fiscal Year (FY) | Net Sales (Millions USD) | Margin (%) | Net Income from Operations (Millions USD) | Accumulated Cash from Previous Year (Millions USD) | ROIC (5.0%) Income (Millions USD) | Net Income / Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (Millions USD) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025** | 2,815.0 | 3.56% | 100.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 100.2 | 1.000 | N/A |
| **2026** | 2,843.2 | 3.65% | 103.8 | 100.2 | 5.0 | 108.8 | 0.917 | 99.7 |
| **2027** | 2,900.0 | 3.75% | 108.7 | 209.0 | 10.5 | 119.2 | 0.842 | 100.4 |
| **2028** | 2,958.0 | 3.85% | 113.9 | 328.2 | 16.4 | 130.3 | 0.772 | 100.6 |
| **2029** | 3,017.1 | 3.95% | 119.3 | 458.5 | 22.9 | 142.2 | 0.708 | 100.7 |
| **2030** | 3,077.4 | 4.00% | 123.1 | 600.7 | 30.0 | 153.1 | 0.650 | 99.5 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | | | | | | **\$500.9** |

*Note: FY 2025 Net Income is assumed to be fully converted into cash for the FY 2026 calculation.*

#### **Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the value of all cash flows after the forecast period (post-FY 2030), calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Method:

*   **Final Cash Flow (FCF) in 2030:** \$153.1 million
*   **Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:** $\text{FCF}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Terminal \text{ Growth \text{ Rate}}) / (\text{Discount \text{ Rate}} - \text{Terminal \text{ Growth \text{ Rate}})$
*   **TV in 2030:** $\$153.1 \times (1 + 0.01) / (0.09 - 0.01) = \$154.63 / 0.08 = \$1,932.9$ million
*   **Terminal Value NPV (TV-NPV):** $\text{TV} \times \text{Discount \text{ Factor}}_{2030}$
*   **TV-NPV:** $\$1,932.9 \times 0.650 = \mathbf{\$1,256.4 \text{ million}}$

#### **Total Equity Value**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sum of Future NPV (2026-2030) | \$500.9 |
| Terminal Value NPV | \$1,256.4 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$1,757.3 |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents** | \$123.6 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$581.4 |
| **Total Fair Equity Value** | **\$1,299.5** |

### **4. Fair Value Per Share Calculation**

*   **Total Fair Equity Value:** \$1,299.5 million
*   **Shares Outstanding:** 23.38 million
*   **Fair Value Per Share:** $\text{\$1,299.5 \text{ million}} / \text{23.38 \text{ million \text{ shares}}} = \mathbf{\$55.58 / \text{share}}$

---

## **Final Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: \$55.58**
**Current Market Price: \$67.00**

### **Justification for Difference Between Fair Value and Market Price**

The calculated fair value of **\$55.58** is approximately **17% lower** than the current market price of **\$67.00**. This suggests the market is assigning a higher value to SPB's future growth and profitability than the conservative DCF model.

**Reasons for the Market's Higher Valuation (Implied Market Assumptions):**

1.  **HPC Spin-Off Premium:** The market likely assigns a premium to the successful and timely execution of the **Home & Personal Care (HPC) strategic solution/spin-off**, believing it will unlock significant value. The market may assume the remaining GPC and H&G businesses (the "pure play" consumer products company) will immediately command a higher multiple as a more focused, faster-growing entity.
2.  **Higher Long-Term Growth Rate:** The market may be discounting the recent headwinds and modeling a much more aggressive annual revenue growth rate, perhaps **3.0% to 4.0%** for 2027-2030, believing the tariff and inventory issues are fully behind the company and the GPC/H&G segments will grow faster than the conservative 2.0% projection.
3.  **Higher Long-Term Margin:** The market is likely anticipating a faster and deeper recovery in profitability, projecting a long-term Net Income Margin closer to **5.0%-6.0%** (vs. the conservative 4.0% used). This would be based on full realization of supply chain and cost-saving initiatives and the improved product mix from the higher-margin GPC/H&G segments.
4.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower WACC/Discount Rate (e.g., 8.0%) due to the company's successful deleveraging to a low net leverage ratio of 1.58x, indicating a lower risk profile and lower cost of debt/equity.

**Justification for the Conservative DCF Model:**

The \$55.58 fair value is grounded in **conservative** assumptions, aligning with the rules provided:
*   **Conservative Growth:** The 1.0% and 2.0% growth rates are cautious given the economic uncertainty, continued consumer softness in durables (HPC), and reliance on a few major retailers (64% of H&G sales from three customers).
*   **Conservative Margin:** The projected Net Income Margin (max 4.0%) is only a slight improvement on the challenging FY 2025 margin (3.56%), prudently accounting for ongoing competitive pressure, inflation risk, and the fact that cost-saving benefits may be partially offset by the need for brand-building investments.
*   **Conservative ROIC/Terminal Rate:** The 5.0% ROIC and 1.0% Terminal Growth Rate are at the low end, providing a healthy margin of safety in the valuation.

The difference suggests the market is pricing in the successful execution of the company's full strategic plan, including a beneficial spin-off and a sharp return to historical profitability, while this valuation model has taken a more cautious, "wait-and-see" approach to that execution.
