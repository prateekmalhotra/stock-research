## 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Spectrum Brands' business engine is focused on **Global Pet Care (GPC)**, **Home & Garden (H&G)**, and its strategy is to eventually separate the **Home & Personal Care (HPC)** business. Management's forward-looking statements anchor the financial projections.

**Core Assumptions (Based on Management Commentary):**

1.  **Revenue Engine:** The primary drivers are:
    *   **Brand Investments:** Management is making incremental brand-building investments to fuel top-line growth.
    *   **Innovation & E-commerce:** Investments in innovation and e-commerce are expected to drive sales across all segments.
    *   **Cost & Supply Chain Improvements:** Operational efficiencies are being pursued to offset headwinds like freight inflation and tariffs.
    *   **HPC Separation:** The dual-track process (sale or spin-off) for the HPC business is ongoing, which is expected to allow the remaining company (GPC and H&G) to *flourish independently* with a more focused business.

2.  **FY 2025 Guidance:** Management expects **low single-digit growth in net sales**. We will use the *most conservative* end of this range: **1.0%** for FY 2025.

3.  **Post-2025 Conservative Growth:** The long-term growth for a diversified consumer products company like SPB is generally modest. The separation of the HPC business (which introduces uncertainty/risk, even if management views it positively) and ongoing macroeconomic challenges necessitate a conservative long-term view.
    *   **2026-2027:** A slight acceleration to **1.5%** as the brand investments begin to yield better results and the HPC separation is finalized, providing greater focus.
    *   **2028-2030 (Maturity):** A slow deceleration to a highly conservative long-term nominal growth rate of **1.0%**, reflecting market saturation and the low-growth nature of the underlying consumer staples categories.

| Year (Fiscal) | Base Revenue (USD M) | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$2,963.9 | N/A | \$2,963.9 |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | \$2,963.9 | 1.0% | **\$2,993.5** |
| **2026** | \$2,993.5 | 1.5% | **\$3,038.4** |
| **2027** | \$3,038.4 | 1.5% | **\$3,084.0** |
| **2028** | \$3,084.0 | 1.0% | **\$3,114.8** |
| **2029** | \$3,114.8 | 1.0% | **\$3,146.0** |
| **2030** | \$3,146.0 | 1.0% | **\$3,177.5** |

## 3. Margin Projections & Cash Flow Engine (2025-2030)

### Margin Projection

**FY 2024 Net Income Margin:**
Net Income Margin = \$99.3 M / \$2,963.9 M = **3.35%**

**FY 2025 Guidance:** Management expects Adjusted EBITDA (excluding investment income) to grow **mid to high single-digits**. This implies margin expansion, as revenue is only expected to grow *low single-digits*. We will assume a conservative expansion of the Net Income Margin based on this, driven by cost improvement initiatives and operational efficiencies.

*   **2025:** A conservative increase to **3.50%** (a small 15 basis point improvement).
*   **2026-2030:** We will assume the company maintains a sustainable, long-term margin of **3.75%**, reflecting the benefit of portfolio simplification (post-HPC separation) and realized cost savings, which is still a conservative margin for a major consumer products company.

### Cash Flow Engine (Net Income to Cash)

Following the instructions, the Net Income for a given year is calculated as:

$$\text{Projected Net Income} = \text{Revenue} \times \text{Net Income Margin}$$

This Net Income is assumed to go straight into the cash for the next year.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation & Additional Income:**
The ROIC is used to calculate "additional income" from the prior year's accumulated cash.

*   **Historical ROIC:** The company had a Net Income of \$99.3 M in FY 2024. Given the past period of asset divestitures and transformation, a long-term historical ROIC is complex and likely distorted.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** Since the company is guiding profitability, and to reflect the company's ability to generate returns on its retained earnings, we will use a **conservative, but reasonable ROIC of 5.0%**. This is a modest rate, reflecting a stable, mature consumer goods business.

$$\text{Net Income (with ROIC)}_{\text{t}} = \text{Net Income}_{\text{t}} + (\text{ROIC} \times \sum_{i=2024}^{\text{t}-1} \text{Net Income (with ROIC)}_{i})$$

| Year (Fiscal) | Projected Revenue (USD M) | Net Income Margin | Projected Net Income (USD M) | Beginning Cash (from prior NI) (USD M) | ROIC (5.0%) (USD M) | Net Income (Total Cash Flow) (USD M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$2,963.9 | 3.35% | \$99.3 | **\$0.0** | \$0.0 | **\$99.3** |
| **2025** | \$2,993.5 | 3.50% | \$104.8 | \$99.3 | \$5.0 | **\$109.8** |
| **2026** | \$3,038.4 | 3.75% | \$113.9 | \$209.1 | \$10.5 | **\$124.4** |
| **2027** | \$3,084.0 | 3.75% | \$115.6 | \$333.5 | \$16.7 | **\$132.3** |
| **2028** | \$3,114.8 | 3.75% | \$116.8 | \$465.8 | \$23.3 | **\$140.1** |
| **2029** | \$3,146.0 | 3.75% | \$117.9 | \$605.9 | \$30.3 | **\$148.2** |
| **2030** | \$3,177.5 | 3.75% | \$119.2 | \$754.1 | \$37.7 | **\$156.9** |

*Note: Beginning Cash is the cumulative Net Income (Total Cash Flow) from all prior years. Net Income (Total Cash Flow) = Projected Net Income + ROIC.*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** SPB is a consumer products company undergoing a restructuring and facing macroeconomic uncertainty. A conservative and reasonable cost of capital (Discount Rate) is determined to be **9.0%**. This is well above a typical low-risk consumer staples WACC and reflects the inherent execution risk of the separation of the HPC business and the low-growth environment.

### Terminal Value

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** We use a very conservative, long-term nominal growth rate for the cash flows beyond 2030. The inflation target for a developed economy is typically around 2-3%. A very conservative perpetuity growth rate is set at **1.5%**, which is below long-term nominal GDP growth and just above our 2028-2030 revenue growth assumption.
*   **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030):**
    $$TV_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{\text{Discount Rate} - g} = \frac{\$156.9 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.090 - 0.015} = \$2,126.9 \text{ M}$$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow (USD M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (USD M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$109.8 | 0.917 | \$100.7 |
| **2026** | \$124.4 | 0.842 | \$104.7 |
| **2027** | \$132.3 | 0.772 | \$102.1 |
| **2028** | \$140.1 | 0.708 | \$99.2 |
| **2029** | \$148.2 | 0.650 | \$96.3 |
| **2030 (Cash Flow)** | \$156.9 | 0.596 | \$93.5 |
| **2030 (Terminal Value)** | \$2,126.9 | 0.596 | \$1,266.6 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | **\$1,863.1** |

### Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Current Cash} - \text{Total Debt}$$

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows (DCF)** | \$1,863.1 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$369.0 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$578.0 |
| **Fair Equity Value** | **\$1,654.1** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 28.0515 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$58.97** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **\$55.70** |

## 5. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB) is **\$58.97**.
The **Current Market Price Per Share** is **\$55.70**.

The calculated fair value is approximately **6% higher** than the current market price.

### Justification of Assumptions and Discrepancy

**Projections Justification:**
*   **Conservatism in Revenue:** The revenue growth assumptions ($1.0\% \to 1.5\% \to 1.0\%$) are highly conservative, anchoring on the low end of management's "low single-digit" guidance for 2025. This reflects the mature, low-growth nature of the consumer products market and global economic headwinds.
*   **Conservatism in Margin:** The projected Net Income Margin ($3.50\% \to 3.75\%$) is a modest improvement from the 2024 actual margin of 3.35%. This small expansion is explicitly backed by management's guidance for "mid to high single-digits" Adjusted EBITDA growth, driven by cost improvement initiatives, which outpaces the low-single-digit revenue growth.
*   **Conservatism in Discount Rate:** A 9.0% Discount Rate is used, which is conservative and higher than typical for stable staples, appropriately factoring in the operational uncertainty and execution risk associated with the major HPC business separation.
*   **Conservatism in Terminal Growth:** The 1.5% perpetuity growth rate is below long-term inflation and nominal GDP, ensuring the Terminal Value is not overstated.

**Market Assumption Analysis (Why \$55.70 vs. \$58.97):**
The market price is very close to the calculated fair value, suggesting that the market's assumptions are largely aligned with this conservative model.

**Our model's assumptions are slightly more optimistic than the market's, but only by a small margin, likely due to one or a combination of the following:**

1.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a slightly higher discount rate (e.g., 9.5% to 10.0%) to fully price in the risk associated with the HPC separation process and the challenging macroeconomic environment (tariffs, inflation) mentioned in the Q2 and Q3 2025 transcripts.
2.  **Slightly Lower Terminal Value:** The market may be assuming a slightly lower long-term maturity growth rate (e.g., 1.0% instead of 1.5%) for the mature consumer product categories.
3.  **HPC Separation Execution Risk:** The market may be assigning a higher probability of value destruction or major one-time costs during the dual-track process of separating the Home & Personal Care business than is implied in a simple continuing operations DCF.

**Conclusion:** The small premium of the calculated fair value (\$58.97) over the current market price (\$55.70) suggests the stock is currently trading near its intrinsic value based on a conservative projection of management's guidance. The difference can be attributed to the market pricing in a marginal, but reasonable, premium for execution and macroeconomic risk.
