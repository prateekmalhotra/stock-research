### 2. Business Engine Analysis and Financial Projections

Spectrum Brands operates in three main segments: Global Pet Care, Home & Garden, and Home & Personal Care. Management's commentary points to a business engine focused on **cost-saving initiatives**, **strategic supply chain diversification (away from China)**, **brand-focused investments**, and **aggressive share repurchases**, all aimed at driving long-term profit and Free Cash Flow (FCF) despite current macro headwinds (tariffs, softening consumer demand).

#### A. Revenue Engine Assumptions (Conservative)

The company’s net sales for the last twelve months (LTM, Q4 FY24 through Q3 FY25) are calculated below. The company had to temporarily pause shipments due to trade negotiations and tariff-related supply chain disruptions, which severely impacted Q3 2025 sales, causing a sharp year-over-year decline.

| Period | Net Sales (Millions USD) | Source/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 Actual** | $2,963.9 | Annual revenue from 10-K [cite: 8 in step 1] |
| Q1 2025 Actual | $700.2 | |
| Q2 2025 Actual | $675.7 | |
| Q3 2025 Actual | $699.6 | |
| **LTM Sales (Q4 2024 to Q3 2025)** | $2,900.2 | ($2,963.9 - Q3 2024 $779.4 + Q3 2025 $699.6) (Approximation of LTM sales) |

**Projection Rationale:**

1.  **FY 2025:** The year will be challenging due to the tariff-induced supply chain disruptions and softening demand. The most recent three quarters' sales sum to $2,075.5M. Assuming Q4 2025 is flat year-over-year to the Q4 2024 sales of $773.7M (to reflect the "rebound" management mentioned), the total FY2025 sales would be $2,849.2M. This represents a conservative **4.1% decline** from FY2024.
2.  **FY 2026 - FY 2027 (Recovery Phase):** Management is moving its supply chain out of China and has re-initiated strategic purchasing. Cost reduction initiatives (targeting over $50M in FY2025) will stabilize the margin and allow for brand investment to drive a modest recovery. I assume **2.0% growth** per year, reflecting a return to modest, below-inflation growth in a consumer staple-type business.
3.  **FY 2028 - FY 2030 (Maturity Phase):** The initial shock is absorbed, and the company benefits from a diversified supply chain and strong brand investments. I project a conservative, long-term industry-aligned growth rate of **1.0%** per year.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual)** | $2,963.9 | - |
| **FY 2025 (Projected)** | $2,849.2 | -4.1% |
| **FY 2026 (Projected)** | $2,906.2 | 2.0% |
| **FY 2027 (Projected)** | $2,964.3 | 2.0% |
| **FY 2028 (Projected)** | $2,993.9 | 1.0% |
| **FY 2029 (Projected)** | $3,023.8 | 1.0% |
| **FY 2030 (Projected)** | $3,054.0 | 1.0% |

#### B. Margin Assumptions

*   **Gross Margin:** FY2024 Gross Margin was 37.4% [cite: 13 in step 2]. The Q3 2025 Gross Margin contracted to 37.8%. The company's strategic focus on lower-cost inventory and cost-improvement initiatives supports a strong margin. I will conservatively use the average of the last two full-year figures available and the recent quarterly figure, then maintain a slow, conservative improvement due to cost-cutting.
    *   **FY 2025 - FY 2027:** **38.0%** (Slightly better than FY2024 due to cost-cutting, but accounting for continued inflation and brand investment).
    *   **FY 2028 - FY 2030:** **38.5%** (Long-term benefit from supply chain diversification and scale).
*   **Net Income Margin:** The company reports net income from continuing operations for FY2024 of $99.3M, a 3.35% margin [cite: 8 in step 1]. The primary driver for future net income growth is the significant reduction in interest expense due to debt repayment/refinancing (Q3 2025 interest expense was nearly half of Q3 2024). The instruction to assume net income goes straight to cash and incorporates ROIC means a simplified approach to Net Income must be used.
    *   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** I will conservatively project a **4.5%** margin for the full period, which is higher than the recent 3.35% but is justified by the lower interest expense, $50M+ cost reductions, and management's focus on profitability.

| Year | Revenue (Millions) | Gross Margin % | Net Income Margin % | Net Income (Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $2,849.2 | 38.0% | 4.5% | $128.2 |
| **2026** | $2,906.2 | 38.0% | 4.5% | $130.8 |
| **2027** | $2,964.3 | 38.0% | 4.5% | $133.4 |
| **2028** | $2,993.9 | 38.5% | 4.5% | $134.7 |
| **2029** | $3,023.8 | 38.5% | 4.5% | $136.1 |
| **2030** | $3,054.0 | 38.5% | 4.5% | $137.4 |

#### C. ROIC and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**
Based on the highly volatile and often negative GAAP Net Income in the company's past, a historical calculation is difficult. To project future *positive* income growth as requested, I will use a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC.

*   **Conservative ROIC:** I assume an annual **3.0%** ROIC on the previous year's accumulated cash (from Net Income). This is a low, stable return reflecting efficient re-investment in a mature consumer products business.

**Discount Rate and Maturity Rate:**

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** **10.0%**. This is a reasonable high rate for a company with macro and operational execution risk.
*   **Conservative Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate:** **1.5%**. This is slightly above the 1.0% long-term revenue growth, representing a conservative long-term inflation and industry growth rate.

| Year (FY End Sep) | Net Income from Operations (A) (Millions USD) | Cumulative Cash from Prior Year (B) (Millions USD) | ROIC Income (B * 3.0%) (C) (Millions USD) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $128.2 | $128.2 | N/A | $128.2 | 0.9091 | $116.5 |
| **2026** | $130.8 | $128.2 | $3.8 | $134.6 | 0.8264 | $111.1 |
| **2027** | $133.4 | $262.8 | $7.9 | $141.3 | 0.7513 | $106.1 |
| **2028** | $134.7 | $404.1 | $12.1 | $146.8 | 0.6830 | $100.3 |
| **2029** | $136.1 | $550.9 | $16.5 | $152.6 | 0.6209 | $94.7 |
| **2030** | $137.4 | $703.5 | $21.1 | $158.5 | 0.5645 | $89.5 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **$618.2** |

*   *Cumulative Cash from Prior Year (B) for Y(n) = Cumulative Cash for Y(n-1) + Net Income for Y(n-1).*
*   *For 2025, Cash from Prior Year is Net Income for 2024 which is $99.3M. Since 2024 Net Income is not in the model, I'm simply using the 2025 Net Income as the first cash injection to begin the cascade, making the total accumulated cash for 2026 $128.2M + $128.2M, etc. To be more precise, let's start the cash build with the 2025 Net Income (A), and accumulate it for the ROIC of the next year.*

**Corrected Cash Flow Accumulation for ROIC:**

| Year | Net Income (A) | Start Cash (B) | ROIC (3.0%) (C) | Total CF (A + C) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV | End Cash (A + B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $128.2 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $128.2 | 0.9091 | $116.5 | $128.2 |
| **2026** | $130.8 | $128.2 | $3.8 | $134.6 | 0.8264 | $111.1 | $259.0 |
| **2027** | $133.4 | $259.0 | $7.8 | $141.2 | 0.7513 | $106.1 | $392.4 |
| **2028** | $134.7 | $392.4 | $11.8 | $146.5 | 0.6830 | $100.1 | $527.1 |
| **2029** | $136.1 | $527.1 | $15.8 | $151.9 | 0.6209 | $94.3 | $663.2 |
| **2030** | $137.4 | $663.2 | $19.9 | $157.3 | 0.5645 | $88.8 | $800.6 |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | | | | | | **$616.9** |

#### D. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030.

*   Terminal Cash Flow (2030) = $157.3 million
*   Terminal Value (TV) = [Terminal Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
*   TV = [$157.3 * (1 + 0.015)] / (0.10 - 0.015)
*   TV = $159.66 / 0.085
*   **TV = $1,878.4 million**

**Terminal Value Net Present Value (NPV):**

*   Terminal NPV = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (2030)
*   Terminal NPV = $1,878.4 * 0.5645
*   **Terminal NPV = $1,059.9 million**

#### E. Fair Value Calculation

| Component | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sum of NPV (2025-2030)** | $616.9 |
| **Terminal Value NPV** | $1,059.9 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$1,676.8** |
| Add: Current Cash & Cash Equivalents | $122.0 |
| Less: Total Debt | $681.1 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$1,117.7** |

**Fair Value Per Share:**

*   Fair Value Per Share = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value Per Share = $1,117.7 million / 24.4 million shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share = $45.81**

### 3. Justification and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $45.81**
**Current Market Price (Approx.): ~$55.00**

**Justification for Fair Value and Market Discrepancy:**

My conservative DCF analysis suggests a fair value of **$45.81 per share**, which is approximately **16.7% lower** than the current market price of roughly $55.00.

**Why the Market is Trading Higher (The Market's Assumptions):**

The market is likely placing a significantly higher value on two key factors, which justifies the current price:

1.  **Higher Long-Term Growth and Margin Expansion (Post-Tariff/Sourcing Shock):** My model uses a very conservative 1.0%-2.0% revenue growth and a final Net Income margin of 4.5%. The market is likely assuming that the strategic divestitures (HHI transaction) and the **$1.3 billion in share repurchases** (reducing the share count by ~42%) will lead to much stronger **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** growth than my Net Income projections imply. The market expects a robust recovery from the tariff and demand shock, with a higher terminal growth rate (perhaps 2.5% to 3.0%) and higher net margins (e.g., 5.5% to 6.0%) due to the *Superior Delivers* cost-cutting initiative and sourcing diversification. If I were to use a 2.5% Terminal Growth Rate and a 5.5% Net Income Margin from 2028 onwards, the valuation would easily exceed $55.00.
2.  **Successful Monetization of FCF/Share Buybacks:** The market is rewarding the aggressive and successful share repurchase program. The company has returned substantial capital to shareholders, significantly boosting EPS. My model, using Net Income as a proxy for cash and then an ROIC on that cash, likely understates the immediate, positive impact of the FCF being used directly for further share count reduction, which is an immediate, accretive boost to per-share value. The management's reiteration of a **$160 million Free Cash Flow target for FY2025** is seen as a strong indicator of capital return capacity.

**My Conservative Position Rationale:**

The lower fair value is a direct result of a conservative approach to two critical, forward-looking assumptions:

1.  **Revenue Growth:** The recent Q3 2025 drop of 10.2% in net sales and the suspension of the full-year earnings framework highlight the high uncertainty. My slow recovery (2.0% growth) is conservative until there is concrete evidence of sustained revenue and organic growth returning post-tariff mitigation.
2.  **ROIC/Reinvestment:** The model uses a low, conservative ROIC of 3.0% and a 1.5% Terminal Growth Rate. This reflects caution on a mature consumer products company's ability to generate high returns on reinvested earnings in a highly competitive, global environment. The market may be assuming the company's strong brands (Home & Garden, Global Pet Care) justify a much higher, "best-in-class" return that is not yet fully visible in the historical numbers.

In conclusion, my valuation is conservative, emphasizing the current operational and macro headwinds, which keeps the resulting share price below the current market price. The market is pricing in a successful, near-perfect execution of the company's strategic plan (sourcing diversification, cost-saving, and aggressive capital return) that my model has deliberately *not* fully assumed.
