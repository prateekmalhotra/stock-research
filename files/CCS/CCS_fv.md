### II. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Forecast

The core business engine for Century Communities (CCS) is **New Home Deliveries multiplied by Average Sales Price (ASP)**. The company's future growth is fundamentally supported by its land pipeline.

**Key Business Metrics from 2025 (Full Year):**
*   **New Home Deliveries:** 10,387
*   **Total Revenues (Home Sales + Other):** \$4.1 billion
*   **Owned and Controlled Lots (Land Pipeline):** ~61,000 at year-end 2025.

#### Revenue Engine & Assumptions

Management guidance for 2026 is conservative, reflecting current high-interest rate and economic uncertainty, projecting deliveries of 10,000 to 11,000 homes. This level is roughly flat compared to 2025. The large pipeline of 61,000 lots provides a significant capacity for growth once market conditions (primarily mortgage rates) normalize.

| Year | Deliveries (Units) | ASP (USD) | Home Sales Revenue (\$M) | Other Rev. (\$M) | Total Revenue (\$M) | Engine Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Actual) | 10,387 | ~$394,724 | ~$4,099.6 | ~$86.2 | **\$4,185.8** | Baseline from SEC filings. |
| **2026** (Est.) | 10,500 | \$380,000 | \$3,990.0 | \$75.0 | **\$4,065.0** | **Conservative near-term guidance:** Deliveries use the midpoint of 10,000-11,000 guidance. ASP is decreased from 2025 to reflect continued higher incentives cited in Q4 2025 earnings calls to drive sales pace. |
| **2027** (Est.) | 11,550 | \$390,000 | \$4,504.5 | \$75.0 | **\$4,579.5** | **Market Normalization:** Assumes a market recovery, leveraging the 61,000 lot pipeline. A conservative 10% growth in deliveries (compared to the flat 2026) and a modest 2.6% ASP increase as incentives begin to ease. |
| **2028** (Est.) | 12,300 | \$400,000 | \$4,920.0 | \$75.0 | **\$4,995.0** | **Moderate Growth:** Slowing delivery growth to 6.5% and a slightly higher ASP increase of 2.6% as improved market conditions allow for price increases. |
| **2029** (Est.) | 13,000 | \$410,000 | \$5,330.0 | \$75.0 | **\$5,405.0** | **Slowing Growth:** Delivery growth eases to 5.7%; ASP increase remains moderate at 2.5%. |
| **2030** (Est.) | 13,500 | \$415,000 | \$5,602.5 | \$75.0 | **\$5,677.5** | **Mature Growth:** Delivery growth is very conservative at 3.8%; ASP increase slows to 1.2% reflecting a more mature homebuilding cycle. |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection

Margins are projected based on full-year 2025 performance and specific management guidance for 2026.

| Metric | 2025 (Actual) | 2026 (Est.) | 2027 (Est.) | 2028-2030 (Est.) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue (\$M)** | \$4,185.8 | \$4,065.0 | \$4,579.5 | See Revenue table | Revenue forecast from above. |
| **Gross Margin % (GAAP)** | 17.6% | 16.5% | 17.0% | 17.5% | Conservative: Reduced from 2025 actual (17.6%) to reflect Q4 2025 GAAP margin of 15.4% and continued high incentives in the near term. Ramps up to 17.5% as market stabilizes and incentives ease. |
| **Gross Profit (\$M)** | \$736.7 | \$670.7 | \$778.5 | \$874.1, \$945.9, \$993.6 | Calculation (Revenue * GM%). |
| **SG&A as % of Revenue** | ~12.2% (Q4 2025) | 13.0% | 12.5% | 12.0% | Management guided for 13% in 2026. Eases to a more efficient 12.0% by 2028-2030 as volume growth absorbs fixed costs. |

### IV. Net Income with ROIC (Cash Flow Projection)

The valuation model assumes net income converts directly to cash, and a return on invested capital (ROIC) is earned on the accumulated cash from the prior year.

*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative **6.0%** is used. While the 2025 Return on Equity (ROE) was 6.87%, a lower, conservative ROIC is appropriate for generating additional cash income from reinvested prior-year cash (Net Income).
*   **Net Income into Cash Flow:** Net Income (Initial) $\to$ Cash.
*   **ROIC Income:** Cash from Previous Year (Net Income) * ROIC.

| Metric (in \$M) | **2025 (Actual)** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(A) Initial Net Income** | \$147.6 | \$105.9 | \$153.6 | \$204.6 | \$221.7 | \$232.9 |
| **(B) Prior Year's Cash (Net Income)** | N/A | \$147.6 | \$105.9 | \$153.6 | \$204.6 | \$221.7 |
| **(C) ROIC Income (B * 6.0%)** | N/A | \$8.9 | \$6.4 | \$9.2 | \$12.3 | \$13.3 |
| **(D) Projected Cash Flow (A + C)** | N/A | **\$114.8** | **\$160.0** | **\$213.8** | **\$234.0** | **\$246.2** |

### V. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

| Assumption | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate for a homebuilder, reflecting industry cyclicality and risk. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (Maturity Rate)** | **2.5%** | A conservative, long-term growth rate assumption, slightly above the long-term U.S. inflation rate, which is suitable for a mature homebuilding company. |

#### Terminal Value and NPV Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows beyond 2030. The 2030 cash flow is the basis for this calculation.

**1. Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
TV in 2030 = (Projected Cash Flow in 2030 * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
TV in 2030 = (\$246.2 M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.090 - 0.025)
TV in 2030 = (\$246.2 M * 1.025) / 0.065 = \$252.355 M / 0.065 = **\$3,882.38 M**

**2. Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV):**

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (\$M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Discounted Cash Flow (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$114.8 | 0.9174 | \$105.3 |
| **2027** | \$160.0 | 0.8417 | \$134.7 |
| **2028** | \$213.8 | 0.7722 | \$165.1 |
| **2029** | \$234.0 | 0.7084 | \$165.8 |
| **2030** | \$246.2 | 0.6499 | \$160.0 |
| **Terminal Value** | \$3,882.38 | 0.6499 | \$2,523.1 |
| **Total NPV (Sum of DCFs)** | | | **\$3,254.0 M** |

---

### VI. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Fair Value of Equity** = Total NPV + Cash - Debt
Total Fair Value of Equity = \$3,254.0 M + \$158.0 M - \$551.5 M
**Total Fair Value of Equity = \$2,860.5 M**

**Fair Value Per Share** = Total Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$2,860.5 M / 29.05 M shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$98.47**

---

### VII. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$98.47** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **\$68.57** |
| **Valuation Upside** | **43.5%** |

**Justification for the Discrepancy (Fair Value vs. Market Price):**

The calculated fair value of **\$98.47** is significantly higher than the current market price of **\$68.57**, implying a substantial undervaluation by the market based on these conservative assumptions.

**Market's Assumptions vs. My Assumptions:**

1.  **Lower Long-Term Growth/Higher Risk Discount:** The market appears to be discounting future cash flows more aggressively than the 9.0% WACC and 2.5% terminal growth rate used in this model. The high uncertainty in the housing market, driven by persistent high mortgage rates, leads to a higher perceived risk and thus a higher discount rate. The market may be assuming the company's long-term growth will not exceed the 2.5% terminal rate, or even be lower, for a longer period.
2.  **Margin Contraction/Continued Incentives:** The market is likely forecasting a steeper and more prolonged period of margin compression than the assumed Gross Margin of 16.5% for 2026 and a slow recovery thereafter. The market is giving more weight to the incentive-driven sales that compress the ASP and the GAAP Gross Margin (which was only 15.4% in Q4 2025) than the long-term cost-efficiency gains and adjusted margins (19.9% in 2025).
3.  **Land/Inventory Impairment Risk:** As a homebuilder, the market may be assigning a higher probability to future inventory impairment charges (like the one seen in Q4 2025) that would reduce future Net Income.
4.  **Conservative Land Pipeline Value:** The market may not fully value the 61,000 owned and controlled lots as a stable source of future growth, or it may assume a slower pace of conversion of these lots into deliveries than the model projects, further extending the period of slower growth.

**My Case for the Fair Value:**

My fair value is justified by two key conservative assumptions, which nonetheless lead to a high valuation:

1.  **Conservative Debt/Asset Treatment:** I used a conservative approach by only netting out the explicit debt found in the filing snippets, which is likely a minimum, but used a very liquid and solid cash position. More importantly, I did not explicitly value the substantial land bank (inventory is often undervalued on the balance sheet for homebuilders) or the record book value per share of **\$89.21** at year-end 2025.
2.  **Conservative Near-Term, Realistic Mid-Term Recovery:** The model accepts the management's conservative 2026 guidance (flat revenue/deliveries) but projects a realistic, yet still conservative, mid-term recovery to a low-to-mid-single-digit growth by 2030, supported by the large, derisked land pipeline. This long-term cash flow generation power, even with a conservative WACC, is what drives the high intrinsic value. The market is focused on short-term macro headwinds, whereas this DCF model prices in the long-term operating capability of the business engine.

The market price seems to be excessively focused on the current, temporary, high-interest rate and incentive-heavy market environment, failing to adequately price in the substantial asset base (Book Value: **\$89.21** per share) and the moderate, long-term growth potential supported by the company's lot pipeline and stated focus on operational efficiency.
