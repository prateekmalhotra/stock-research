### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for YPF is the rapid, high-margin development of its unconventional resources in the Vaca Muerta shale play, while simultaneously divesting non-core, mature conventional assets.

**Engine Assumptions (Based on Management Guidance and Conservative World Knowledge):**

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shale Oil Production (kbbl/d)** | 165 | 250 | 300 | 375 | 450 | 500 |
| **Growth Driver** | 165 kbbl/d is the 2025 target [cite: 6 (from step 1)]. | 250 kbbl/d is the target by end of 2026 [cite: 6 (from step 1)]. | Conservative step-down in growth rate. | Continued ramp-up towards the 2030 target. | Continued ramp-up towards the 2030 target. | 500 kbbl/d is the long-term target [cite: 6 (from step 1)]. |
| **Shale Oil Annual Volume (MMbbl)** | 60.2 | 91.2 | 109.5 | 136.9 | 164.3 | 182.5 |
| **Total Production (kboe/d) Base (Q2 2025)** | 546 | 550 | 554 | 558 | 563 | 567 |
| **Non-Shale Oil/Gas/Downstream Sales (Proxy for Rest of Business Revenue)** | $12,500M | $12,500M | $12,500M | $12,500M | $12,500M | $12,500M |

*   **Production Volume:** The shale oil volume drives the increase, moving from 165 kbbl/d in 2025 to 500 kbbl/d in 2030, in line with management's stated plan and infrastructure unlocking (VMOS pipeline) [cite: 6 (from step 1)]. Total Production (kboe/d) is assumed to remain roughly flat to slightly increasing as the ramp-up in high-value shale oil offsets the divestment of lower-value conventional assets ("Mature Fields Exit Program" [cite: 11 (from step 1)]).
*   **Crude Oil Price Assumption (Realized Price/bbl):** YPF's 2024 average realized crude price was $\sim$ $70.8/bbl [cite: 2 (from step 4)]. To be conservative, we assume a slightly declining but stable real long-term price for this oil, which is below Brent forecasts (Brent forecasts suggest a possible decline towards $\sim$ $51/bbl by 2026, though long-term is divided [cite: 12 (from step 2), 14 (from step 2)]).
    *   **Conservative Price Trend:** $70/bbl for 2025, declining to a conservative long-term price of $65/bbl by 2030.
*   **Revenue from Non-Shale/Downstream:** The total 2024 revenue was $19,293M. I estimate $\sim$ $6,793M from 2024 shale oil (based on $\sim$ $70.8/bbl realized price on 107 kbbl/d average shale production). The remaining $\sim$ $12,500M from the rest of the business is assumed to remain flat (conservative, as growth in Downstream is offset by gas price uncertainty and divestitures).

| Year | Shale Oil Revenue (A) | Non-Shale/Downstream Revenue (B) | Total Projected Revenue (A+B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $4,214M | $12,500M | $16,714M |
| **2026** | $6,384M | $12,500M | $18,884M |
| **2027** | $7,557M | $12,500M | $20,057M |
| **2028** | $9,370M | $12,500M | $21,870M |
| **2029** | $11,183M | $12,500M | $23,683M |
| **2030** | $12,019M | $12,500M | $24,519M |

### 3. Net Income Projections & ROIC Calculation

#### a. ROIC Calculation (for Reinvestment Effect)

*   **ROIC Formula:** Net Income / Invested Capital
*   **Invested Capital Proxy (2024):** Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) is used as a conservative proxy for the capital base that generates the income. We use the most recent PPE figure, **$20,246M** (Q2 2025).
*   **Net Income (2024):** $2,393 million [cite: 11 (from step 1)].
*   **ROIC (2024):** $2,393M / $20,246M = **11.8%**
*   **Conservative Assumed ROIC for Reinvestment:** I will use a **conservative 10.0%** to model the additional income generated by reinvested cash flow.

#### b. Net Income Margin & Projections

*   **2024 Net Income Margin:** $2,393M / $19,293M = **12.4%**.
*   **Conservative Net Income Margin Assumption:** YPF's strategy is to shift to high-margin shale. Given the lower unit cost of Vaca Muerta core shale ($\sim$ $4.9/boe [cite: 1 (from step 4)]) compared to the total extraction cost ($\sim$ $12.3/boe [cite: 1 (from step 4)]), the margin should expand. However, due to the high political/economic risk in Argentina and the conservative nature of this valuation, the margin is assumed to grow slowly: **12.5% in 2025 to 15.0% in 2030.**

| Year | Total Projected Revenue | Base Net Income Margin (%) | Base Net Income (A) | Reinvested Cash from Prior Year | ROIC on Reinvested Cash (B) (10.0%) | **Total Net Income (A+B)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | $19,293M | 12.4% | $2,393M | $0M | $0M | $2,393M |
| **2025** | $16,714M | 12.5% | $2,089M | $2,393M | $239M | $2,328M |
| **2026** | $18,884M | 13.0% | $2,455M | $2,328M | $233M | $2,688M |
| **2027** | $20,057M | 13.5% | $2,708M | $2,688M | $269M | $2,977M |
| **22028** | $21,870M | 14.0% | $3,062M | $2,977M | $298M | $3,360M |
| **2029** | $23,683M | 14.5% | $3,434M | $3,360M | $336M | $3,770M |
| **2030** | $24,519M | 15.0% | $3,678M | $3,770M | $377M | $4,055M |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

Net Income (Total Net Income column from above) is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for this DCF calculation, as is the assumption required by the rules.

#### a. Discount Rate and Terminal Growth Rate

*   **Discount Rate (WACC/Ke):** YPF is an Argentine company with significant geopolitical and economic risk. Although it's transitioning to hard-currency exports, the country risk is high. A **conservative discount rate of 12.0%** is used (higher than a typical international oil major to reflect country risk).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** The global energy transition and a conservative approach to long-term oil prices, combined with the maturation of the Vaca Muerta play, warrant a very low growth rate. A **very conservative maturity rate of 1.0%** is used.

#### b. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (FCFE) (Millions of US$) | Discount Factor (1 / (1+0.12)^t) | NPV of FCFE (Millions of US$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | $2,328 | 0.8929 | $2,079 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | $2,688 | 0.7972 | $2,143 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | $2,977 | 0.7120 | $2,120 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | $3,360 | 0.6355 | $2,135 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | $3,770 | 0.5674 | $2,139 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | $4,055 | 0.5066 | $2,054 |
| **NPV of Projected FCFE (2025-2030)** | **$12,670 million** | | |

#### c. Terminal Value (TV)

The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, based on the 2030 FCFE.
TV = [FCFE\_2030 * (1 + g)] / (r - g)
TV = [$4,055M * (1 + 0.01)] / (0.12 - 0.01)
TV = $4,096M / 0.11
TV = **$37,236 million**

#### d. NPV of Terminal Value

NPV of TV = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (t=6)
NPV of TV = $37,236 million * 0.5066
NPV of TV = **$18,866 million**

#### e. Total Enterprise Value (EV)

Total Enterprise Value = NPV of Projected FCFE + NPV of Terminal Value
Total Enterprise Value = $12,670 million + $18,866 million
**Total Enterprise Value = $31,536 million**

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions of US$) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $31,536 million | |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $9,844 million | |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,011 million | |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | $22,703 million | $31,536M - $9,844M + $1,011M |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 393,312,793 | |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$57.72** | $22,703M / 393.31M |

### 6. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share (YPF): $57.72**

#### Comparison to Market Price

As of the current date (November 1, 2025), if the market price for YPF is, for example, **$34.99** [cite: 6 (from step 2)], the calculated fair value of **$57.72** suggests the stock is **undervalued by approximately 65%**.

#### Justification for Discrepancy

The significant difference between the calculated Fair Value and the assumed Market Price is primarily due to the **market heavily discounting YPF's future cash flows due to unmitigated Argentine country risk**.

**The Market is Assuming:**

1.  **Lower Realized Price:** The market likely assumes a larger discount to international oil prices or a higher volatility due to ongoing government intervention risk in the domestic fuel market, despite the Vaca Muerta pivot toward exports.
2.  **Failure to Execute:** The market discounts the management's ambitious growth plan, assuming YPF will fail to reach the 500 kbbl/d shale oil target by 2030, or that the required capital (CapEx) will be significantly higher, leading to lower net free cash flow.
3.  **Higher Discount Rate:** The market's implied discount rate (Ke) is likely much higher than the conservative 12.0% used in this model, possibly in the 15-20% range, reflecting extreme political instability, currency volatility, and the non-transferability of funds out of the country. A higher discount rate severely penalizes long-dated cash flows (the terminal value).

**The Valuation is Assuming (Justification):**

1.  **Management Guidance is Achievable:** The model takes management's production growth targets for Vaca Muerta as the engine, which is the core directive of the new administration and YPF's strategic focus [cite: 6 (from step 1)]. The conservative growth in Net Income margin from 12.5% to 15.0% by 2030, despite a high-margin asset base, is a measured approach.
2.  **Prudent Financial Assumptions:** The model uses a conservative price deck ($70 to $65/bbl) and a very low terminal growth rate (1.0%), reflecting caution on long-term oil markets and the political environment.
3.  **ROIC Component:** The inclusion of a 10.0% ROIC on reinvested earnings is justified by the extremely high quality and low-cost nature of the Vaca Muerta assets, giving YPF a structural competitive advantage that should generate superior returns on internal investment (compared to the $\sim$ 11.8% calculated historical ROIC).

**Conclusion:** The calculated fair value of $57.72 represents a price target assuming YPF successfully executes its strategic shift to Vaca Muerta exports and the Argentine country risk, while remaining high, stabilizes enough to allow for international oil-and-gas company-like operations. The market's current price of $\sim$ $34.99 implies a belief that the political and economic instability will continue to fully negate the potential of the world-class Vaca Muerta resource base.
