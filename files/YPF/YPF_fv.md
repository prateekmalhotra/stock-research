### II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Forecast (2025-2030)

YPF's business engine is defined by a strategic pivot away from mature fields toward the development of high-growth, lower-cost **Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas** resources, coupled with downstream efficiency improvements and a long-term **LNG project**.

#### 1. Revenue Driver Assumptions (The Business Engine)

The core revenue driver is the increase in *unconventional* hydrocarbon production volume at competitive lifting costs, coupled with market-aligned pricing (import parity).

*   **Production Volume (Shale Oil):** Management provided concrete shale oil production targets. This is the primary growth engine [cite: 5 in step 2]:
    *   2025 Average Target: 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).
    *   2026 Target: $\approx 215,000$ boe/d.
    *   2027 Target: $\approx 290,000$ boe/d.
    *   2030 Target: $\approx 500,000$ boe/d (total production) [cite: 3 in step 2].
*   **Pricing:** The company reduced its fuel price gap to import parity from 20% in 2023 to 2% in 2024, implying market-aligned pricing power is largely realized [cite: 2 in step 2]. I will assume a stable Realized Price per Barrel, keeping it conservative given global oil price volatility.
*   **Base Revenue (2024):** \$19.3 Billion [cite: 2 in step 2].

#### 2. Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Instead of a flat percentage growth, the revenue growth will be linked to the announced Shale Oil Production targets, which represent the high-value segment of the business.

| Year | Shale Oil Target (boe/d) [cite: 5 in step 2] | Annual Production Growth Factor (based on targets) | Implied Total Revenue Growth Rate (Conservative) | Revenue (US\$ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 122,000 | N/A | N/A | **\$19,300** |
| **2025 (Avg)** | 165,000 | $165/122 \approx 35.2\%$ | $\mathbf{15.0\%}$ (Conservative: Half the production growth rate to account for lower-value production/declines) | **\$22,195** |
| **2026** | 215,000 | $215/165 \approx 30.3\%$ | $\mathbf{12.0\%}$ | **\$24,858** |
| **2027** | 290,000 | $290/215 \approx 34.9\%$ | $\mathbf{14.0\%}$ | **\$28,338** |
| **2028** | Interpolated growth to reach 500K by 2030 (total) | N/A | $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ | **\$31,172** |
| **2029** | N/A | N/A | $\mathbf{8.0\%}$ | **\$33,666** |
| **2030** | 500,000 (Total Prod.) | N/A | $\mathbf{6.0\%}$ (Conservative slow-down as LNG is only starting) | **\$35,686** |

**Justification for Conservative Revenue Growth:** The implied production growth from 2024 to 2027 is significant (averaging >30% on the core asset). A conservative revenue growth rate is used (12%-15% range) because:
1.  Total Revenue also includes the declining/divesting mature fields and non-E&P segments.
2.  Global oil/gas price volatility is a major risk factor (which is implicitly managed by using a lower growth rate).
3.  The LNG project is a long-term capital commitment (CapEx \$20-\$25B) and is only expected to start operations by 2030, so its full impact is not factored into this 2030 horizon [cite: 5 in step 2].

### III. Margin and Net Income Projection

#### 1. Margin Assumption

*   **2024 Net Income Margin:** \$2,393M / \$19,300M $\approx \mathbf{12.4\%}$ [cite: 12 in step 2, 2 in step 2].
*   **Future Net Income Margin:** YPF's shift to low-cost shale operations (lifting cost $\sim\$7.5/boe$ excl. mature fields, down from $\sim\$15.6/boe$ total in 2024) and high downstream margins (\$13.7/barrel in 2024) suggests margin expansion [cite: 3 in step 2, 2 in step 2].
*   **Assumption:** Given the clear management strategy to improve efficiency and focus on high-margin assets, I will conservatively increase the Net Income Margin from 12.4% to a stable **14.0\%** from 2025 onwards. This accounts for higher profitability, but is still modest for a highly efficient integrated energy company.

#### 2. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation

*   **ROIC (2024 proxy):** This calculation is a proxy for the returns on internally generated cash.
    *   Total Equity (2024): The 20-F is needed for the exact figure, but for a conservative proxy: Total Assets - Total Liabilities. Given the Net Income (\$2.4B), I must assume a reasonable, conservative ROIC.
    *   **Assumption:** Since past ROIC is difficult to precisely calculate without a full balance sheet, and past results included major impairments/losses, I will use a conservative but reasonable $\mathbf{5.0\%}$ ROIC. This is a modest return for an E&P company in a high-growth environment (Vaca Muerta), reflecting the political and economic risks in Argentina.

#### 3. Net Income Projection (DCF Cash Flow)

The DCF cash flow is calculated as: **Net Income for the year + (Previous Year's Accumulated Cash * ROIC)**.

| Year | Revenue (US\$ Millions) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (A) (US\$ Millions) | Previous Year's Cash (B) (US\$ Millions) | ROIC (C) | ROIC Income (B * C) (US\$ Millions) | Cash Flow for DCF (A + D) (US\$ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | \$19,300 | 12.4% | \$2,393 | \$0 | N/A | \$0 | N/A |
| **2025** | \$22,195 | 14.0% | \$3,107 | \$2,393 | 5.0% | \$120 | **\$3,227** |
| **2026** | \$24,858 | 14.0% | \$3,480 | \$5,500 | 5.0% | \$275 | **\$3,755** |
| **2027** | \$28,338 | 14.0% | \$3,967 | \$8,980 | 5.0% | \$449 | **\$4,416** |
| **2028** | \$31,172 | 14.0% | \$4,364 | \$12,947 | 5.0% | \$647 | **\$5,011** |
| **2029** | \$33,666 | 14.0% | \$4,713 | \$17,311 | 5.0% | \$866 | **\$5,579** |
| **2030** | \$35,686 | 14.0% | \$4,996 | \$22,024 | 5.0% | \$1,101 | **\$6,097** |
| **Note:** *Previous Year's Cash (B)* is the cumulative Net Income from the start of the projection (2024 Net Income + all subsequent Net Income) *before* the ROIC adjustment for the current year. E.g., for 2026, it is \$2,393 + \$3,107 = \$5,500.

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### 1. Conservative DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | $\mathbf{10.0\%}$ | A conservative rate for an emerging market energy company. It is higher than a typical developed market WACC to account for the high political and currency risk associated with operating in Argentina. |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | $\mathbf{2.0\%}$ | A very conservative, lower-than-inflation-rate growth rate for the Terminal Value, reflecting long-term stabilization in a politically uncertain market after 2030. |

#### 2. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected cash flows (2025-2030) is calculated as:
$$
NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

| Year (t) | Cash Flow (CFt) (US\$ Millions) | Discount Factor $\mathbf{(1/(1.10)^t)}$ | NPV of Cash Flow (US\$ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | \$3,227 | 0.9091 | \$2,934 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | \$3,755 | 0.8264 | \$3,103 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | \$4,416 | 0.7513 | \$3,318 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | \$5,011 | 0.6830 | \$3,423 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | \$5,579 | 0.6209 | \$3,464 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | \$6,097 | 0.5645 | \$3,441 |
| **NPV of Forecast Period** | | | **\$19,683** |

#### 3. Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (2030)

The Terminal Value is the perpetuity of cash flow after 2030.
$$
TV_{2030} = \frac{CF_{2030} \times (1+g)}{r-g} = \frac{\$6,097 \times (1+0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{\$6,219}{\$0.08} = \$77,738 \text{ Million}
$$

#### 4. Net Present Value of Terminal Value

$$
NPV(TV) = \frac{TV_{2030}}{(1+r)^6} = \frac{\$77,738}{(1.10)^6} = \$77,738 \times 0.5645 = \mathbf{\$43,892 \text{ Million}}
$$

#### 5. Total Enterprise Value (TEV)

$$
TEV = NPV (\text{Forecast Period}) + NPV(TV) = \$19,683 \text{M} + \$43,892 \text{M} = \mathbf{\$63,575 \text{ Million}}
$$

### V. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

#### 1. Fair Value of Equity

| Metric | Value (US\$ Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | \$63,575 |
| Less: **Total Debt** | (\$10,611) |
| Add: **Total Cash & Short-Term Investments** | \$1,016 |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | $\mathbf{\$53,980}$ |

#### 2. Fair Value Per Share

$$
\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$53,980,000,000}{393,312,793} = \mathbf{\$137.25}
$$

---

## Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value Per Share: **\$137.25**

### Current Market Price (Hypothetical): **\$35.00**

#### Justification for Disparity

The calculated fair value of **\$137.25** is significantly higher than the hypothetical current market price of **\$35.00**. This large disparity indicates that the market is making far more conservative assumptions than the valuation model, primarily due to the unique geopolitical and macroeconomic risks in Argentina.

**The Market's Conservative Assumptions (Why the Market is $\ne$ DCF):**

1.  **Extreme Political/Sovereign Risk and "Argentina Discount":** The market is likely applying a severe discount to account for the risk of capital controls, expropriation, government interference in pricing (which has historically happened), and general political instability. The market is not taking management's aggressive production and profitability guidance as "truth" due to this sovereign risk.
2.  **High Discount Rate/Cost of Equity:** The market is likely implicitly using a much higher discount rate (well above my conservative 10.0%) to value the long-term cash flows, as the future of YPF's ability to repatriate dollars and sustain market-aligned prices is uncertain.
3.  **Inflation/Currency Devaluation Risk:** My model is in stable US dollars, while YPF operates in an environment of extremely high inflation and currency devaluation. The market is discounting the present value of future Argentine peso-denominated cash flows more aggressively than my model's assumption of a 14.0% stable dollar-denominated Net Income Margin.
4.  **CapEx and Negative Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The large \$20-\$25 billion long-term LNG CapEx and the continued high CapEx to sustain Vaca Muerta growth means Free Cash Flow will be negative or minimal for years (FCF was negative $\sim\$759M$ in Q3 2025) [cite: 7 in step 2]. Investors are hesitant to value a company that will be a net cash user for the foreseeable future, despite the promise of future returns.

**Defense of the DCF (Why the High Value is Possible):**

1.  **Management Guidance as Truth:** Per the rules, I must assume management's commentary is "truth." The entire valuation is driven by management's strategic plan: the $35\%$ average growth in core shale production in 2025, reaching 290,000 boe/d by 2027, the low lifting cost of $\sim\$7.5/boe$ (excl. mature fields), and the elimination of the domestic pricing gap [cite: 2, 3, 5 in step 2].
2.  **Vaca Muerta's True Potential:** If Argentina achieves macroeconomic stability and YPF executes its plan, Vaca Muerta is a world-class, low-cost resource base that fundamentally justifies a valuation in line with major international E&P companies, where the NPV of reserves is extremely high.
3.  **Conservative ROIC/Maturity Rate:** The use of a very conservative 5.0% ROIC and a 2.0% maturity rate already attempts to bake in some of the general risk, suggesting the high valuation is driven by the very aggressive and transformative production growth figures management provided.

**Conclusion on Disparity:**

The DCF valuation of **\$137.25** represents the *intrinsic value* of YPF's assets and growth potential **assuming full and successful execution of the management's strategic plan in a politically and economically stable environment.** The current market price of **\$35.00** reflects an enormous **risk premium** applied to the Argentine sovereign risk, essentially saying the market believes there is a very high probability that the management team will be unable to execute its long-term plan due to external/political forces.
