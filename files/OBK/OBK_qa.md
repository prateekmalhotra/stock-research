## Business Summary

Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) is a regional bank focused primarily on providing traditional banking services taking deposits from customers and using that cash to fund various loans, mainly across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Its customer base includes local individuals seeking standard banking services and mortgages, as well as small to mid-sized businesses requiring financing for operations or growth. The company makes most of its money from net interest income, which is the profitable difference between the interest it charges on new loans and the lesser interest it pays to its depositors. While lending is the core activity, it also generates revenue through various fees charged for banking services and mortgage origination.

## Business Model Risk

The biggest near-term risk is interest rate volatility; if the Federal Reserve raises rates quickly, the bank must pay higher interest on customer deposits immediately, potentially squeezing profit margins on existing long-term loans that were set at lower rates. This 'interest rate risk' was a major stress point for banks in 2023. A recurring long-term threat is credit risk, where regional economic downturns cause its commercial business clients to default on their loans, severely reducing the bank's earnings, a dynamic that occurs consistently during recessions. Furthermore, the failures of several regional banks in 2023 highlighted liquidity risk: if customers, especially large business depositors, rapidly withdraw large sums of money due to market panic, it stresses the bank s immediate cash reserves, regardless of its underlying health. Finally, because OBK is concentrated in a specific geographic area (the Southern US), any regional economic shock or natural disaster could disproportionately harm its earnings and market position.

## Company History

Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) has a history that stretches back more than a century, growing from a small-town bank to a publicly-traded regional financial company.

### **The Early Years: Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Inception:** The company traces its roots back to 1912, when it was founded as the First National Bank of Ruston in Ruston, Louisiana.
2.  **Founding Purpose:** The bank was established with the goal of serving the direct financial needs of its local community during a period of economic expansion in Northern Louisiana.
3.  **Core Philosophy:** From the beginning, its culture was rooted in **personalized, relationship banking**, focusing on building long-term ties with local businesses, municipalities, and personal clients to enrich the lives of the people in its service area.

### **Strategic Expansion and Growth**

4.  **Family Leadership and First Expansion:** In the 1990s, the bank began a strategic expansion under the leadership of the Thomson family, moving beyond its original, immediate geographic footprint.
5.  **The Rebrand:** In 1997, the institution changed its name to **Origin Bank** to reflect its growing regional presence and wider range of services, and the holding company, Origin Bancorp, Inc., was formed to manage this growth.
6.  **The Texas Tailwind:** A major tailwind for the company was its decision to expand into the fast-growing Texas market, entering Dallas/Fort Worth in 2008 and Houston in 2013, which provided new areas for growth.

### **Navigating Headwinds and Major Challenges**

7.  **Dealing with Competition (Headwind):** As they grew from a community bank into a regional bank, they faced the headwind of intense competition from much larger, national, and super-regional banks in their markets.
8.  **The Great Recession (Implied Headwind Navigation):** Though they were expanding during the period of the 2008 Financial Crisis, their community banking structure and focus on traditional, local relationship lending likely helped them avoid the risky, complex investments that brought down many larger Wall Street banks.
9.  **COVID-19 Response (Tailwind from Government Program):** During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company was able to quickly pivot, successfully participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and providing over $560 million in loans to support businesses, which strengthened their customer relationships.
10. **The Tricolor Fraud Event (Major Headwind):** A recent and significant challenge was the isolated event of a fraud allegation at a customer, subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy.
11. **Financial Impact:** This event required the company to take a very conservative measure, booking a major, one-time net charge-off of $28.4 million on the Tricolor loan debt in the third quarter of 2025 (fiscal year).

### **Innovative Solutions and Present-Day Strategy**

12. **The "Relationship Banking" Solution:** A continuous, innovative solution that allowed them to compete with larger banks is their commitment to local decision-making and personalized service, which attracts small-to-medium businesses that often feel overlooked by national institutions.
13. **Strategic Mergers:** They have used strategic acquisitions, such as the 2022 merger with BTH Bancshares, Inc., to efficiently expand their asset base and market share in key areas like Texas.
14. **Enhanced Credit Oversight (Tricolor Response):** In direct response to the Tricolor challenge, Origin Bancorp established a new internal group focused on enhanced credit management, audit processes, and fraud detection to mitigate future risk.
15. **The "Optimize Origin" Initiative (Present Strategy):** The company launched a strategic plan called "Optimize Origin" to transform the business model, with the goal of becoming a "top-quartile performer" by concentrating on improved asset quality, better financial performance, and cost discipline.
16. **Current Goal and Footprint:** Today, Origin Bancorp, Inc. is a financial holding company providing a broad range of services—commercial, retail, mortgage, and wealth management—operating over 60 locations across Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and recently expanding into South Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.

## Moat Analysis

Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) operates as a regional financial institution, and its competitive advantage, or "moat," is built less on proprietary technology or patents and more on localized relationships, strategic growth, and high switching costs inherent to banking.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and what makes it distinct from its competitors:

### Origin Bancorp's Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Strategic Focus on High-Growth Markets:** Origin Bancorp differentiates itself by strategically focusing on and expanding into fast-growing economic regions across the South, including Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, East Texas, North Louisiana, Mississippi, South Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. This geographical diversification and focus on thriving areas allow the company to pursue strong loan and deposit growth and mitigate the risk of an economic downturn in any single local market.

2.  **"Best-in-Class" Corporate Culture:** The company has an exceptional focus on its internal culture, which has been recognized by *American Banker* as one of the "Best Banks to Work For" for multiple consecutive years. This strong, employee-focused culture helps the bank attract and retain top talent, which is the most critical asset for a service-driven business like relationship banking.

3.  **Relationship-Based Community Banking:** OBK's core identity is providing personalized, community banking services to small-to-medium-sized businesses, municipalities, and retail clients. This relationship-first approach to lending and treasury management creates a **"switching cost" moat**, as businesses often prefer a local bank with a personal touch over a large national competitor, making their contracts *sticky* and *recurring*.

4.  **Pricing Power through Superior Service and Relationships:** While banks generally have limited pricing power, OBK's focus on deep relationships with its commercial and industrial (C&I) clients and municipalities can grant it some localized advantage. Companies are often willing to pay a slightly higher rate or accept lower deposit interest from a bank that provides excellent, reliable, and personalized service, which is a key part of the relationship-based model.

### Recurring Contracts and Displacement

5.  **Customer Relationships are Sticky and Recurring:** Banking is inherently a sticky business. Deposits (checking/savings accounts) and loans (commercial real estate, C&I) are long-term, recurring contracts. Moving a business checking account, refinancing a complex commercial loan, or switching treasury management services involves significant time, administrative work, and risk, which creates **high switching costs** and discourages customers from leaving.

6.  **Displacement is Possible, but Difficult:** A competitor with significantly more capital can enter the market, but displacing Origin Bancorp is not easy. While a large bank can offer slightly better rates, it cannot easily replicate the deep, long-standing, personalized relationships and local knowledge OBK has built over decades. OBK's strategy of organic growth and selective acquisitions, tracing back to its founding in 1912, has allowed it to build a strong local reputation that acts as a buffer against well-capitalized newcomers.

### Network Effects and Innovation

7.  **Subtle Network Effects from Commercial Banking:** True network effects (where the product gets better as more people use it) are not as strong for a bank as for a social media company, but they exist. For example, a successful local bank often becomes the preferred lender for real estate developers, commercial businesses, and key municipal accounts, which then organically attracts other related businesses and high-net-worth individuals to the bank.

8.  **Innovation Focused on Efficiency and Client Experience:** The company does not invest in "R&D" in the traditional sense, but it is focused on technology adoption. It is actively investing in **digital platform advancements** and **process automation** (e.g., saving over 6,500 hours through automation) to enhance the client experience and drive operational efficiency. This is a critical investment for regional banks to remain competitive with larger, technology-driven institutions and does require constant improvement to maintain a service edge.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on recent news, earnings calls, and investor releases, here is an analysis of the catalysts that could increase Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK)'s stock price.

---

### **Near-Term Catalysts (0-12 Months)**

1.  **Success of "Optimize Origin" Initiative (Management Strategy):**
    *   **Management Focus:** The company's primary strategic initiative, **"Optimize Origin,"** is focused on driving efficiency and improving profitability. Management is working to get the Return on Average Assets (ROAA) above 1% in the near term.
    *   **Catalyst:** Continued expense reduction, streamlining of operations, and margin expansion from this initiative could lead to better-than-expected earnings, which is a key driver for stock price appreciation.

2.  **Resolution of Credit Issues and Improved Credit Quality:**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management has been actively working through credit issues, specifically noting a significant loan loss provision and charge-off related to **Tricolor Holdings** in Q3 2025.
    *   **Catalyst:** Demonstrating stable or improving credit quality, especially if nonperforming assets decrease and further large one-time charge-offs are avoided, would remove an overhang from the stock and restore investor confidence.

3.  **Insider Buying Confidence:**
    *   **Catalyst:** The recent, substantial insider buying activity by key executives and directors, including the CEO, COO, CFO, and CRO, signals that company leadership believes the stock is currently undervalued and has a positive outlook. This can often lead to positive market sentiment and attract more investors.

4.  **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Expansion and Deposit Growth:**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management has successfully grown total deposits and, importantly, **non-interest-bearing deposits**, which are cheaper to hold. They have also seen an expansion of the Net Interest Margin (NIM) in recent quarters.
    *   **Catalyst:** If interest rates stabilize or decline, combined with management's success in attracting lower-cost, non-interest-bearing deposits, the NIM should continue to improve, which directly boosts net interest income and profit.

---

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)**

1.  **Strong Earnings Growth and Valuation Re-rating:**
    *   **Management Focus:** The company's strategy is built on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly in its growing **metro Texas markets** and new Southeast markets (South Alabama and Florida Panhandle).
    *   **Catalyst:** Analysts project a high annual earnings growth rate (around 19.8% per year), which is well above the broader market average. As the "Optimize Origin" changes fully take hold and demonstrate consistent profitability, the market may assign a higher valuation multiple to the stock, closing the gap between the current price and the analyst estimated fair value.

2.  **Growth in Fee Income from Wealth Management:**
    *   **Catalyst:** A timely investment in **Argent Financial** is expected to add a fair value boost to future earnings through higher fee income. Consistent growth in non-interest income (or fee income) from areas like treasury management and wealth services reduces reliance on traditional lending and diversifies revenue, which is viewed positively by investors.

3.  **Capitalizing on Loan Production in Key Markets:**
    *   **Management Focus:** Management notes that high levels of loan production are currently being masked by paydowns and payoffs. They maintain ample capacity to grow the portfolio, especially in the Acquisition, Development, and Construction (ADC) and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) segments.
    *   **Catalyst:** If the current high level of loan production translates into sustained, net loan growth in their metropolitan Texas and Southeast markets, it will drive future interest income and asset size.

## Management Incentive

The analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure for Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) is based on the company's public disclosures, primarily its 2024 Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) covering compensation for the 2023 fiscal year.

**Conclusion:** Origin Bancorp, Inc.'s management incentive structure is **well-aligned with the long-term interests of the shareholders**. The compensation philosophy is heavily performance-based and equity-weighted, which directly ties management's potential wealth creation to sustained stock performance and key financial objectives that benefit shareholders.

***

### **Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK)**

#### **1. Compensation Structure (Pay Mix)**

*   **Performance-Weighted Compensation:** The executive compensation program is designed with a strong emphasis on variable and performance-based elements, confirming a "pay for performance" philosophy.
*   **Equity-Heavy Mix:** For the Named Executive Officers (NEOs), a substantial portion of total compensation is paid in the form of **Stock Awards** and **Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation** (short-term bonus), shifting the focus away from fixed base salary.
    *   *Example:* In 2024, the CEO's compensation was primarily composed of Stock Awards and Non-Equity Incentive Plan compensation, significantly exceeding the base salary, which strongly aligns management's financial success with the stock's performance.

#### **2. Performance Metrics and Alignment**

*   **Focus on Key Financial Metrics:** The incentive compensation metrics are tied to "key strategic initiatives" and management's stated focus is on "long-term, profitable growth for our shareholders" and improving "return on assets and efficiency."
*   **Long-Term Equity Awards:** The compensation structure includes annual long-term equity awards, which are a strong mechanism for shareholder alignment, as the awards typically only vest over a period of years and realize value only if the stock price increases.
*   **Discouraging Short-Termism:** The emphasis on long-term growth and efficiency metrics, rather than purely short-term goals, helps discourage executives from taking excessive risks or making decisions just to achieve immediate gains at the expense of long-term shareholder value.

#### **3. Insider Ownership & Governance**

*   **Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines:** The company has approved Executive Stock Ownership guidelines, which the Compensation Committee periodically reviews. This governance feature ensures executives are required to personally hold a significant stake in the company's common stock.
*   **Directors' Alignment:** As a collective, the directors and executive officers have personal beneficial ownership in the company, though the precise percentage is not explicitly stated in the summary search results. Higher insider ownership is generally viewed positively, as it signifies a more direct interest in the stock's market value.
*   **Clawback Policy:** The company has a revised clawback policy in compliance with new SEC and NYSE Listing Standards, which permits the company to recover incentive compensation if financial results are restated due to material noncompliance. This acts as a deterrent against fraudulent or misleading reporting for personal gain.

## Price History

This analysis for Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) is based on financial data and market commentary as of the latest available search results.

***

### **Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK) Price History and Technical Analysis**

1.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Based on a recent price of approximately **$34.24** and a 52-week low of **$28.80**, Origin Bancorp is trading approximately **18.89%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Trading Range Context:** The stock is currently trading closer to its 52-week low than its high, as the price of $34.24 is significantly below its 52-week high of **$41.17**.

3.  **Technical Analysis Indicators:** Technically, the stock is showing signs of weakness as it is trading **below its 50-day moving average** of $36.05, and some analysis suggests a general "bearish momentum" in the short term.

4.  **Market Sentiment (Mixed Signal):** Despite the bearish technical signs, the overall analyst consensus on the stock is a **"Buy"** with an average price target of **$43.20**, which is substantially higher than the current trading price. Additionally, a recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) points to an **improving near-term earnings outlook**, a powerful force often correlated with future stock price movement.

***

### **Major Price Movements and Explanations**

5.  **Big Drop: Earnings Miss:** A significant drop in the stock price occurred following the **Q3 2025 earnings release** (October 22, 2025), where the company reported an EPS of **$0.27**, which was a substantial miss compared to the consensus estimate of approximately $0.80 to $0.89. This substantial earnings miss—a negative surprise of over 66%—overshadowed strong revenue performance and led to a sharp decline in the stock's value.

6.  **Sector-Specific Drop (Bankruptcy):** A separate drop occurred previously when a major customer, **Tricolor Holdings**, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This forced Origin Bancorp to place approximately **$30.1 million in loans on non-accrual status**, heightening investor concern over potential loan losses in the regional banking sector.

7.  **Positive Internal Outlook:** Despite the recent profit slump, the bank's internal "Optimize Origin" initiative has driven a significant increase in **pre-tax, pre-provision earnings**, and the company is aiming for a rebound in performance, which may support the stock's longer-term value.

---

## Long Thesis

Origin Bancorp is set up for a strong rebound because the recent major drop in its stock price was caused by a one-time problem—a large loan that went bad. Management has aggressively written off this loss and is now executing a focused plan called "Optimize Origin" to boost profits and cut costs. This plan is expected to push their profitability (Return on Assets) above 1% soon. The bank operates in some of the fastest-growing markets in the Southern U.S., especially in Texas, allowing for strong, high-quality loan growth moving forward. Because OBK focuses on deep, personal banking relationships, its business customers are loyal and unlikely to leave for a national competitor, making their revenue sticky. As the company shows consistent, clean earnings over the next year, proving their efficiency measures are working and that the bad loan is truly behind them, the market will re-rate the stock back toward its fair value.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumptions required for this positive outlook to materialize are:
1. The "Optimize Origin" cost-cutting and efficiency plan is executed successfully, leading directly to higher profit margins and a Return on Assets (ROA) above 1% by late 2025.
2. The significant credit charge-off taken on the previous customer (Tricolor) was an isolated event, and there will be no other unexpected, large loan defaults that require major write-downs in the near future.
3. The economies in the bank's key markets (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi) remain strong enough to support consistent demand for new loans and commercial business financing.
4. Interest rate pressures stabilize or decline, allowing the bank's Net Interest Margin (the difference between loan interest earned and deposit interest paid) to expand and boost net income.
5. The bank's relationship-based banking model continues to successfully compete against larger national institutions, maintaining high customer retention rates.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Origin Bancorp (OBK) presents a solid narrative, but a deeper dive into the recent financial data reveals several material flaws and risks that create a compelling bear case.

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **1. Credit Quality Normalization is Not Fully Proven**

The long thesis assumption that the Tricolor charge-off was a "one-time problem" that is "truly behind them" is optimistic. While the fraud-related charge-off was isolated, the overall credit picture is not entirely clean.

1.  **Broad Credit Deterioration:** Nonperforming assets (NPAs) and classified loans have continued to increase sequentially, even excluding the one-time Tricolor loss. An increase in classified loans from 1.66% to 1.84% of total loans in one quarter suggests underlying credit quality is migrating downwards across the portfolio, challenging the narrative that only the single, one-off event is impacting credit health.
2.  **Credit Culture Risk:** The fact that a large, isolated fraud loss occurred points to potential weaknesses in the bank's underwriting, due diligence, or credit monitoring processes that may not be entirely resolved by internal review. This suggests the "Optimize Origin" plan must also include a costly, long-term overhaul of risk management, which could increase expenses and slow growth.

#### **2. Growth Engine is Stalling, Contrary to Thesis**

The bullish case relies heavily on "strong, high-quality loan growth moving forward" fueled by fast-growing Southern markets.

1.  **Revised Flat Loan Growth Guidance:** Origin Bancorp revised its full-year 2025 loan growth guidance down to essentially **flat** from previous expectations of low single-digit growth. This directly undercuts the premise of "strong" growth and means the bank cannot rely on market-fueled loan expansion to organically boost net income in the near term.
2.  **Headwind from Payoffs and Paydowns:** While loan originations increased, this production was entirely offset by elevated paydowns and payoffs, which management noted were well above historical norms. This indicates that either customers are leaving or are consolidating/refinancing with competitors, or the high-rate environment is stalling new borrower activity, raising questions about the "sticky" revenue model.

#### **3. Profitability Target is Based on a Non-GAAP Metric**

The assumption that the efficiency plan will "push their profitability (Return on Assets) above 1% soon" is overly reliant on internal metrics.

1.  **Divergence from Reported ROA:** While management touts a strong improvement in the **pre-tax pre-provision ROA (PTPPR-ROA)**, which hit 1.63% (excluding notable items), the actual reported diluted EPS missed analyst forecasts, and the latest twelve months Return on Assets is only **0.8%**. The high PTPPR-ROA is a sign of operational improvement, but the market re-rates on *reported* ROA, which remains suppressed by provisioning costs, suggesting the full impact of efficiency is not flowing to the bottom line yet.
2.  **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Headroom is Limited:** The assumption of an expanding NIM is challenged by the bank's own Q4 2025 guidance, which is already tight at 3.60% to 3.65% and models in further Federal Reserve rate cuts. This suggests the current NIM is near its peak, and future growth will be harder to achieve through margin expansion alone.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Origin Bancorp, Inc. (OBK)**

**Origin Bancorp is a regionally focused bank whose post-rebound narrative of a "clean slate" and strong growth is premature, as operational gains are being neutralized by external credit pressure and stalled loan growth.**

1.  **Credit Normalization is a Mirage:** While the major charge-off from the Tricolor fraud is a known event, underlying credit quality is still deteriorating, as evidenced by the sequential increase in both classified loans and nonperforming assets, indicating broader stress across the loan portfolio.
2.  **Growth Trajectory is Flat, Not Strong:** The bank has revised its full-year 2025 loan growth guidance to flat, which is a direct contradiction to the bull case's expectation of "strong" growth. This flat loan balance, driven by high payoffs and paydowns, raises concerns about competitive pressures and the true stickiness of customer relationships, particularly in an environment of market disruption.
3.  **Profitability Target is Not the Whole Story:** The operational success of the "Optimize Origin" plan, which is evident in the PTPPR-ROA, is being masked by elevated credit provisioning costs. The market is unlikely to re-rate the stock toward fair value until the reported ROA consistently moves above 1% for several quarters, a feat that is challenged by the ongoing credit migration.
4.  **Interest Rate Headwinds Remain:** Net Interest Margin (NIM) expansion is already slowing and is likely near its peak. Any further interest rate volatility, or simply a prolonged holding pattern, will limit a primary driver of bank profitability and make the aggressive ROA target more difficult to achieve, regardless of cost-cutting success.

## Next Steps

The initial analysis has clearly defined the core conflict between the "one-time loss" bullish argument and the "underlying credit deterioration/flat growth" bearish argument. The search results have provided specific quantitative data to directly address the next logical questions.

Here is a summary of the answers found and the next steps for investigation:

### **Answers Found in Initial Search**

*   **Credit Quality (The core conflict):** Classified loans and nonperforming assets *did* increase sequentially in Q3 2025, even with the Tricolor fraud loss excluded, supporting the bear case of "broader credit deterioration." However, management states that excluding Tricolor, net charge-offs were only **0.16%** for the quarter, and they "do not see signs of credit deterioration," directly challenging the bear argument.
*   **"Optimize Origin" Success:** The plan is ahead of schedule, with an estimated annualized pre-tax benefit of **$37.2 million** identified, and management is still targeting a **1%+ ROAA run rate by Q4 2025**. The Pre-Tax Pre-Provision ROA (PTPPR-ROA), excluding notable items, increased significantly to **1.63%**, confirming efficiency is improving.
*   **Growth Guidance:** Loan growth guidance for 2025 was officially revised to **flat**, confirming the bear case's concern, but the company anticipates a return to **mid- to high single-digit growth in 2026**.
*   **Analyst Rationale:** The analyst consensus price target of **~$43.20** (a significant upside) is based on the expectation that the *operational improvements* from the "Optimize Origin" plan will lead to a re-rating once the one-time Tricolor event is behind them.

***

### **Next Steps to Investigate**

The key remaining questions revolve around validating the forward-looking assumptions (2026 growth) and contextualizing the credit and profitability data with peers.

1.  **Validate the 2026 Loan Growth Rebound:**
    *   **Question:** What is driving the high level of loan paydowns and payoffs that led to the *flat* 2025 guidance?
    *   **Action:** Investigate the specific loan categories (**Commercial Real Estate (CRE)** vs. **Commercial & Industrial (C&I)** vs. **Mortgage Warehouse**) that saw the highest paydowns and what management believes will reverse this trend to achieve the projected mid- to high single-digit growth in 2026.

2.  **Contextualize Credit and Profitability with Peers:**
    *   **Question:** How do Origin Bancorp's latest credit metrics (e.g., Classified Loans to Total Loans) and efficiency (Efficiency Ratio, Reported ROA) compare to other regional banks of similar size operating in the fast-growing Texas/Louisiana/Southeast markets?
    *   **Action:** Search for a comparison of OBK's key financial metrics against its direct peers (e.g., BankPlus (MS), First Horizon (TN), or others in the Southern U.S.) to see if the credit deterioration is a systemic regional issue or isolated to OBK.

3.  **Analyze Exposure to High-Risk Categories (CRE):**
    *   **Question:** Given the broader stress in commercial real estate, what is Origin Bancorp's specific exposure to the riskiest CRE subsectors (e.g., office space and multi-family) and what is the Weighted Average Loan-to-Value (LTV) of their total CRE portfolio?
    *   **Action:** Search for the latest investor presentation slides or earnings call commentary detailing the composition and LTV of their CRE portfolio, as this is a primary systemic risk for regional banks.
