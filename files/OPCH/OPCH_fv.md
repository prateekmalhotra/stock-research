## **Part 2: Business Engine and Revenue/Net Income Projection**

The business engine of Option Care Health is driven by two main therapy portfolios: **Chronic (approx. 75% of revenue)** and **Acute (approx. 25% of revenue)**. The chronic business provides a stable, long-term revenue base, while the acute business can be more volatile. The primary growth and margin levers are:

1.  **Patient Volume/New Referrals:** Driven by the shift of care from high-cost hospital settings to the home/alternate sites.
2.  **Therapy Mix:** Growth in higher-margin therapies (rare/orphan) offsets margin pressure from established therapies (e.g., biosimilars).
3.  **Operational Efficiency:** Increased nurse productivity via Ambulatory Infusion Suites and SG&A leverage.

### **Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The projection is built upon management's guidance and then conservatively extrapolated using the identified business drivers.

| Year | Revenue Guidance/Projection (in millions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$4,998 | Actual net revenue for the full year 2024. |
| **2025** | \$5,625 | Midpoint of management's updated full-year guidance (\$5.60B - \$5.65B), representing 12.5% YoY growth. This incorporates the estimated \$60M - \$70M headwind from STELARA biosimilars, meaning underlying growth is higher. |
| **2026** | \$5,900 | Midpoint of management's preliminary guidance (\$5.8B - \$6.0B), representing 4.9% YoY growth. The significant biosimilar headwind from 2025 is largely absorbed, leading to a more normalized but still conservative mid-single-digit growth. |
| **2027** | \$6,200 | Assuming a **5.1%** conservative growth rate. This reflects continued but slowing organic growth as market penetration increases and ongoing, though less severe, biosimilar pressure in the chronic portfolio is expected. |
| **2028** | \$6,480 | Assuming a **4.5%** growth rate. Continuing to temper the growth rate to reflect a conservative long-term outlook for a mature home infusion market leader. |
| **2029** | \$6,760 | Assuming a **4.3%** growth rate. |
| **2030** | \$7,030 | Assuming a **4.0%** growth rate. |

### **Net Income & Margin Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The Net Income projection for 2025 is derived from the Adjusted EBITDA guidance, and subsequent years are based on conservative margin assumptions and the required ROIC reinvestment model.

**2025 Base Year Calculation:**

1.  **Adjusted EBITDA (Midpoint):** \$470.5 million
2.  **Net Interest Expense (Midpoint):** \$56 million
3.  **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** For 2024, D&A was \$60.9 million. I will conservatively increase this by 5% to \$64 million in 2025 to reflect continued infrastructure investment.
4.  **EBT (Earnings Before Tax):** Adjusted EBITDA - D&A - Net Interest = \$470.5 - \$64 - \$56 = **\$350.5 million**
5.  **Tax Rate (Midpoint):** 26%
6.  **Base Net Income (NI_projection):** \$350.5 million * (1 - 0.26) = **\$259.4 million**

**ROIC & Reinvestment Model (2026 - 2030)**

*   **ROIC Assumption:** I will use a conservative but reasonable positive Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **6.0%**. This is justified as a stable, mature healthcare service provider with pricing power and operational leverage should be able to generate a return on reinvested capital greater than its cost of capital over time.
*   **Net Income Reinvestment Rule:** Net Income for next year = NI_projection from that year + ROIC from net income got from previous year.

| Year | Revenue (A) | NI Projection (B) | Previous Year's NI (C) | ROIC (6.0%) from C (D) | Final Net Income (B+D) | Margin % (E/A) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | \$4,998 | N/A | N/A | N/A | **\$211.8** | 4.24% |
| **2025** | \$5,625 | \$259.4 | \$211.8 | \$12.7 | **\$272.1** | 4.84% |
| **2026** | \$5,900 | \$278.3 | \$272.1 | \$16.3 | **\$294.6** | 5.00% |
| **2027** | \$6,200 | \$300.0 | \$294.6 | \$17.7 | **\$317.7** | 5.12% |
| **2028** | \$6,480 | \$315.6 | \$317.7 | \$19.1 | **\$334.7** | 5.17% |
| **2029** | \$6,760 | \$330.4 | \$334.7 | \$20.1 | **\$350.5** | 5.19% |
| **2030** | \$7,030 | \$345.5 | \$350.5 | \$21.0 | **\$366.5** | 5.21% |

**Note on NI Projection (B) for 2026-2030:** Assumes Net Income as a percentage of revenue remains around the target 5.0% for 2026, slightly expanding to 5.21% by 2030. This is conservative given management's focus on cost leverage (SG&A leverage, nurse efficiency) countering gross margin headwinds.

## **Part 3: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

### **Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions**

*   **Discount Rate (Cost of Capital):** A conservative rate of **9.0%** is used. This accounts for the market-leading position and stable nature of the healthcare services industry, but incorporates a risk premium above a long-term risk-free rate (e.g., 4-5%) due to the complex regulatory and drug pricing environment.
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.0%** is used. This is slightly below the long-term US GDP growth and reflects a mature, low-growth phase for the company beyond the projection period (2030), consistent with the "conservative" rule.

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

The Net Income figures are treated as the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the DCF calculation, as per the instruction: "net income for each year goes straight into cash."

**Terminal Value (TV):**
$$TV = \frac{FCF_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{(\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate})}$$
$$TV = \frac{\$366.5 \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.09 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$373.83}{\text{0.07}} \approx \$5,340.4 \text{ million}$$

**NPV of Future Cash Flows:**

| Year | FCF (Net Income) (E) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of FCF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$272.1 | 0.9174 | \$249.7 |
| **2026** | \$294.6 | 0.8417 | \$247.9 |
| **2027** | \$317.7 | 0.7722 | \$245.4 |
| **2028** | \$334.7 | 0.7084 | \$237.1 |
| **2029** | \$350.5 | 0.6499 | \$227.8 |
| **2030 (Operating)**| \$366.5 | 0.5963 | \$218.4 |
| **2030 (Terminal)**| \$5,340.4 | 0.5963 | \$3,184.2 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$4,610.5** |

## **Part 4: Fair Value Calculation**

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$4,610.5 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$413 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$1,105) |
| **Equity Value** | **\$3,918.5** |
| **Divide by: Shares Outstanding** | 158.73 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$24.68** |

### **Fair Value of Option Care Health, Inc. (OPCH) Stock**

The calculated **Fair Value Per Share** for Option Care Health, Inc. (OPCH) is **\$24.68**.

***

## **Part 5: Justification and Market Comparison**

*   **Calculated Fair Value:** **\$24.68**
*   **Current Stock Price (Context):** **\$34.62**
*   **Difference:** The market price is approximately **40% higher** than the calculated fair value.

### **Justification for the Difference**

The significant difference suggests that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future growth and profitability than the conservative DCF model presented here.

**1. Revenue Growth Rate Assumption:**

*   **DCF Assumption (Conservative):** Average YoY growth of **~6.8%** from 2025-2030 (driven by 12.5% in 2025 and slowing to 4.0% by 2030).
*   **Market Assumption (Implied):** The market is likely pricing in a higher, sustained growth rate, perhaps closer to **8-10%** for the entire projection period. This would be justified by a more aggressive view on:
    *   **New Therapy Adoption:** Strong and continuous launch of new rare and orphan therapies, which are often high-margin and less susceptible to immediate biosimilar pressure.
    *   **Site-of-Care Shift:** A faster and more profound shift of infusion care from hospitals to the home setting, driven by payer and patient preference for lower-cost and more convenient care.
    *   **Acquisition/M&A:** The market may be assuming value-accretive acquisitions (like the IntraMed Plus acquisition mentioned in the Q4 2024 guidance) that are not factored into this organic growth-based projection.

**2. Profitability and Margin Assumption:**

*   **DCF Assumption (Conservative):** Net Income Margin expands modestly from 4.84% in 2025 to **5.21%** in 2030. This is based on management commentary that operational efficiencies must offset margin headwinds from drug mix/biosimilars.
*   **Market Assumption (Implied):** The market may believe OPCH can execute greater operational leverage and SG&A savings, leading to a Net Income Margin in the **6.0% - 7.0%** range by 2030, suggesting better control over drug costs or a greater mix of high-margin therapies.

**3. Discount Rate Assumption:**

*   **DCF Assumption (Conservative):** **9.0%** to reflect regulatory and competitive risk.
*   **Market Assumption (Implied):** A lower perceived risk (lower discount rate) would substantially increase the present value. A lower discount rate of **7.5%**, which implies a lower cost of capital, would result in a much higher Fair Value.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated fair value of **\$24.68** represents a **highly conservative baseline value** for Option Care Health, Inc. It assumes management's guidance only for the near term, a slow deceleration of growth thereafter, significant margin pressure requiring operational gains merely to sustain margins, and a high cost of capital (9.0%) with a minimal terminal growth rate (2.0%).

The market price of **\$34.62** is justified if investors assume the company's strategic investments in operational efficiency and its position to capitalize on the secular shift to home-based care will translate into a sustained revenue growth rate of **8% or more** and a terminal Net Income Margin greater than **6%**, paired with a lower cost of capital. **The DCF model is intentionally conservative** by projecting continued operational headwinds and a rapid deceleration of growth to minimize risk, thereby establishing a floor valuation that the current market price comfortably exceeds.
