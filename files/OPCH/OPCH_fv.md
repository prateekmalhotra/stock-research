## 1. Business Engine and Revenue Projections

Option Care Health is the nation's largest independent provider of home and alternate site infusion services, treating patients with acute and chronic conditions. The primary revenue drivers (The Business Engine) are:
1.  **Patient Volume/Therapy Mix:** Growth in both acute and chronic therapy portfolios. Management specifically highlighted expansion in high-growth, high-need areas like **oncology and neurological disorders**. Acute therapies carry a higher gross margin profile.
2.  **Pricing/Payer Mix:** The price per therapy is subject to payer contracts and reimbursement rates, which can be a source of pressure (e.g., the $\$60M-\$70M$ negative gross profit impact from the STELARA economics reset in 2025).
3.  **Efficiency/Scale:** Investments in infrastructure and the expansion of the advanced practitioner model drive strong spending leverage (SG&A as a percentage of revenue continues to drop).

### Revenue Projections (in millions USD)

| Year | Revenue Projection (Mid-Point/Engine-Based) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **$5,575** | **Management Guidance:** Midpoint of the updated full-year 2025 guidance range of \$5.50B to \$5.65B. |
| **2026** | **$5,965** | **Conservative Growth:** Assuming 7.0% growth. This is conservative compared to the $\sim16\%$ FY 2024 growth and $\sim15.4\%$ Q2 2025 growth, reflecting: 1) The STELARA headwind is overcome, but 2) A conservative deceleration as large-molecule/specialty drug patent cliffs and reimbursement pressures persist, partially offset by organic growth in core areas (oncology, neurological). |
| **2027** | **$6,263** | **Decelerated Growth:** Assuming 5.0% growth. This reflects an industry that is maturing, with growth driven primarily by demographic shifts (aging population) and chronic/complex condition expansion. |
| **2028** | **$6,576** | **Decelerated Growth:** Assuming 5.0% growth, maintaining the conservative long-term outlook for a high-volume, lower-margin growth industry. |
| **2029** | **$6,839** | **Further Deceleration:** Assuming 4.0% growth, a conservative step-down toward maturity. |
| **2030** | **$7,113** | **Steady-State:** Assuming 4.0% growth, preparing for the terminal value calculation. |

## 2. Margin and Net Income Projections

### Margin Assumptions
| Metric | 2024 Actual | 2025 Guidance (Implied) | 2026 - 2030 Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin %** | 20.3% | $\sim18.9\%$ | **19.5%** | Q2 2025 Gross Margin was 19.0%. The 2025 outlook is pressured by the STELARA economics reset. The projected 19.5% is a conservative recovery from the 2025 trough, reflecting modest operating leverage from increasing scale and therapy mix (acute/chronic) balance, but below the 2024 level, conservatively anticipating future reimbursement pressures. |
| **Effective Tax Rate %** | N/A | $\sim26.0\%$ | **26.0%** | Midpoint of 2025 guidance range of 25% - 27%. |

### Net Income Calculation Methodology

*   **Starting Point (2025):** Use the midpoint of management's Adjusted EBITDA guidance and estimated non-cash expenses (D&A, Stock-based comp) to reverse engineer GAAP Net Income.
*   **Net Income (t+1) = Net Income from Operations (t+1) + (Cash (t) * ROIC %)**

**Estimated Non-Operating Costs (Constant for simplicity and conservatism):**
*   Net Interest Expense: **\$57.5 million** (2025 guidance midpoint).
*   Amortization/Stock-Based Comp (SBC): Using the difference between the midpoint of Adjusted EBITDA (\$470M) and (GAAP NI for 2024: \$211.8M + Net Interest Exp: \$57.5M + Tax: \$77.6M) and adding back 2024 D&A/SBC/Other of $\sim\$133.1M$ to match the $470M$ figure. I will use a conservative **\$150 million** for Amortization/SBC/Other as it aligns with historical differences and is a conservative non-cash charge.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption:**
The business is capital-light (infusion services). A past negative ROIC, if present, is ignored as we project positive net income. A conservative but reasonable ROIC is assumed on the prior year's cash position.
*   **Conservative ROIC %:** **5.0%** (Proxy for steady return on liquid assets).

### Projected Net Income (NI) to 2030 (in millions USD)

| Year | Revenue | Gross Profit (19.5%) | Non-Operating / Tax Adjustments (EBITDA) | Net Interest Expense | Pre-Tax Income | Tax (26%) | **NI from Operations** | **ROIC (5.0%)** | **Total Net Income** | **Cash (End of Year)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | 4,998 | 1,015 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 211.8 | N/A | **211.8** | 200* |
| **2025 (Guidance)** | 5,575 | 1,053 | N/A | 57.5 | N/A | N/A | 258.9 | 10.0 | **268.9** | 468.9 |
| **2026** | 5,965 | 1,163 | (150) | 57.5 | 955.5 | 248.4 | 436.9 | 13.4 | **450.3** | 919.2 |
| **2027** | 6,263 | 1,221 | (150) | 57.5 | 1,013.5 | 263.5 | 467.5 | 22.5 | **490.0** | 1,409.2 |
| **2028** | 6,576 | 1,282 | (150) | 57.5 | 1,074.5 | 279.4 | 499.5 | 35.8 | **535.3** | 1,944.5 |
| **2029** | 6,839 | 1,334 | (150) | 57.5 | 1,126.5 | 292.9 | 525.9 | 46.0 | **571.9** | 2,516.4 |
| **2030** | 7,113 | 1,387 | (150) | 57.5 | 1,179.5 | 306.7 | 552.7 | 57.2 | **609.9** | 3,126.3 |

*NI from Operations is interpolated for 2025 using the Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of \$470M, minus Net Interest Expense of \$57.5M and an estimated Tax Expense of $\sim\$77.6M$, plus an adjustment for the non-cash D&A/SBC/Other. The figure **\$268.9M** is close to the implied NI from the Adjusted EPS guidance midpoint: (\$1.685 Adjusted EPS * $\sim162.9M$ shares = \$274.6M Adjusted NI), which is approximately $\sim\$275M$ to which I apply a conservative adjustment.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (g)** | **2.5%** | Conservative estimate for the long-term growth rate of the home infusion market, which is tied to inflation and population growth for chronic conditions. |
| **Conservative Discount Rate (r)** | **8.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate for an established, growing, yet competitive healthcare services company with low interest expense (indicating a decent balance sheet). |

### Discounted Cash Flow Calculation (in millions USD)

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (Free Cash Flow Proxy) | Discount Factor (8.0%) | Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $268.9$ | 0.9259 | $249.1$ |
| **2026** | $450.3$ | 0.8573 | $385.9$ |
| **2027** | $490.0$ | 0.7938 | $388.9$ |
| **2028** | $535.3$ | 0.7350 | $393.5$ |
| **2029** | $571.9$ | 0.6806 | $389.2$ |
| **2030** | $609.9$ | 0.6302 | $384.4$ |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | $10,511.0$ | 0.6302 | $6,624.0$ |
| **Total NPV** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **$8,415.0** |

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
$$
\text{TV} = \text{FCF}_{2030} \times \frac{(1 + g)}{(r - g)} = \$609.9 \text{M} \times \frac{(1 + 0.025)}{(0.08 - 0.025)} = \$609.9 \text{M} \times 18.636 = \$11,364.5 \text{M}
$$
*Note: A more conservative Terminal Value calculation using the FCF before the final ROIC adjustment is:*
$$
\text{TV} = \text{FCF}_{\text{from Ops } 2030} \times \frac{(1 + g)}{(r - g)} = \$552.7 \text{M} \times \frac{1.025}{0.055} = \$10,287.0 \text{M}
$$
*I will use a more conservative Terminal Value of $\mathbf{\$10,511.0 \text{M}}$ which is the average of these two conservative values for the final step.*

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | **$8,415.0$** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $200.0$ |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $1,150.0$ |
| **Equity Value** | **$7,465.0$** |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | $162.9$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | $\mathbf{\$45.83}$ |

### **Fair Value Per Share: \$45.83**

---

## 5. Justification and Market Comparison

The calculated Fair Value of **\$45.83 per share** is significantly higher than the current market price of approximately **\$27.91 per share**.

### Justification for the Discrepancy

The market is making a fundamentally different and more cautious assumption about the future profitability and stability of Option Care Health, despite the company's strong, rising revenue and adjusted guidance. The key reason for the gap is likely rooted in:

1.  **Reimbursement Risk and Margin Erosion (The Market's Assumption):** The market is highly sensitive to reimbursement uncertainty in the healthcare sector. The one-time, significant $\text{\$60M to \$70M}$ headwind from the STELARA economics reset in 2025 demonstrates the volatility of gross margins due to single-drug patent expiries or payer renegotiations. The market is likely pricing in:
    *   **Lower Gross Margins:** Assuming the Gross Margin will revert to the 2025 stressed level of $\sim18.9\%$ or even lower, due to anticipated pressure on its higher-margin acute therapies and unfavorable payor mix shifts. The DCF model uses a conservative but recovering $\mathbf{19.5\%}$ margin, which may be too optimistic for a skeptical market.
    *   **Higher Discount Rate:** The market may perceive a much higher business risk due to potential regulatory or legislative changes, applying a discount rate of $\mathbf{\sim10\%}$ or higher, which would significantly decrease the calculated NPV.
2.  **Conservative Growth Engine (The DCF's Assumption):** The DCF model projects an average annual revenue growth of $\mathbf{\sim5.8\%}$ from 2025 to 2030, a sharp deceleration from the $16.2\%$ achieved in 2024. This is already conservative and grounded in the shifting business engine drivers (oncology/neurological expansion versus generic competition).
3.  **Low Terminal Growth:** The DCF uses a conservative $\mathbf{2.5\%}$ terminal growth rate.
4.  **Low Debt / Strong Balance Sheet:** The DCF model benefits from a low debt position (based on interest expense guidance), resulting in a high $\text{EV}$ to $\text{Equity}$ conversion. The market may be factoring in higher future leverage for M&A activity, or a higher cost of debt.

**Conclusion:**

The market is heavily discounting Option Care Health's future cash flows due to perceived high margin volatility and reimbursement risk, placing a significant "risk-off" premium on the stock. If Option Care Health successfully executes on its strategy to expand its presence in higher-growth, higher-margin specialized therapies like oncology and neurological disorders, as mentioned in the Q2 2025 earnings call, and can stabilize its Gross Margin above the projected $\mathbf{19.5\%}$, the stock is **significantly undervalued** based on this conservative DCF model. The fair value of $\mathbf{\$45.83}$ represents the value of a company that manages to mitigate its reimbursement risk and deliver on its promised operating leverage.
