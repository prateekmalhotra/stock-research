## Business Summary

Agree Realty Corporation is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that acts as a national landlord for major retail businesses across the United States. Its core business model involves acquiring and developing single-tenant properties—such as grocery stores, convenience stores, and auto parts shops—and leasing them to large, financially stable corporations. This is typically done through a 'net lease,' where the tenant pays rent and also covers most property expenses like taxes and insurance, providing ADC with highly predictable and reliable long-term revenue streams, usually locked in for a decade or more. ADC’s customer base is entirely B2B, focusing on necessity-based and discount retailers that tend to perform well even during economic slowdowns.

## Business Model Risk

The business faces two primary risks. The first, and most significant near-term threat, is rising interest rates. Because ADC funds new property purchases partly through borrowing, higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, making it more expensive to acquire properties that generate sufficient returns. This risk has been evident in recent years as central banks rapidly raised rates, which compresses ADC’s profit margins on new deals and can slow overall growth. The second long-term risk involves tenant bankruptcy or retail disruption. Although ADC selects high-credit tenants, a severe economic recession could lead to defaults, causing ADC to lose guaranteed rental income. While ADC survived previous crises, such as the 2008 recession and the pandemic, the long-term threat of e-commerce could make certain physical retail locations obsolete over time. If a key tenant vacates a property, ADC incurs costs to re-lease the space, hurting its consistent earnings and market value.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on Agree Realty Corporation (ADC), explained in simple, jargon-free English.

***

## **Agree Realty Corporation (ADC): A History from Inception to Present**

Agree Realty Corporation is a company that owns and leases out retail properties across the United States, operating as a **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)**. In simple terms, a REIT is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate and is legally required to distribute most of its income to shareholders, which is why it often pays a steady dividend.

### **Part 1: The Founding and Initial Focus (1971 – 2009)**

1.  **Inception (1971):** The company was founded by Richard Agree in Farmington Hills, Michigan, under the name **Agree Development Company**.
2.  **The Original Goal:** The initial business model was to act as a real estate developer, building and managing **community shopping centers**. For over 20 years, the company primarily focused on developing over 40 centers in the Midwest and Southeast, often anchored by the largest retailers of the time, such as Kmart.
3.  **Going Public (1994):** The company transitioned from a private development firm to a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a shift to the name **Agree Realty Corporation**. This move allowed them to access capital from public investors (selling stock) to fund their growth.
4.  **Early Headwind (Problem):** This original strategy led to a problem: a high concentration of the portfolio's rental income came from just a few large tenants. For example, by 2010, much of the property base was leased to Kmart and Borders bookstore, both of which faced major financial decline and bankruptcy in the early 2000s and beyond. This concentrated exposure made the company very vulnerable to the failure of a single tenant.

### **Part 2: The Strategic Pivot (ADC 2.0) and Innovative Solutions (2010 – Present)**

The potential collapse of major tenants forced a radical strategic change, known internally as "ADC 2.0," which started around 2010 and defined the modern company.

#### **The Innovative Solution: The Net Lease Focus**

1.  **New Leadership, New Vision:** Joey Agree, Richard's son, became President (2009) and later CEO (2013), and led the pivot away from large shopping centers to acquiring **freestanding, single-tenant net lease properties**.
2.  **Jargon-Free Explanation of "Net Lease":** In a net lease arrangement, the tenant (the store) agrees to pay for all property operating costs—including real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. This is different from a regular landlord arrangement. For Agree Realty, this model provides very stable and predictable rental income because the costs are reliably covered by the tenant.
3.  **Focus on "E-Commerce and Recession-Resistant" Tenants:** The new strategy focused on properties leased to retailers that offer services people need even in an economic downturn or a major shift to online shopping. This includes:
    *   **Essential Retailers:** Grocery stores (like Walmart), Home Improvement (like Home Depot), Auto Parts, and Dollar Stores.
    *   **High-Quality Tenants:** They intentionally sought out tenants with an **"investment-grade credit rating,"** meaning the retailer has a very strong financial standing and is highly unlikely to default on the lease. Today, nearly 70% of their portfolio is leased to these top-tier, financially strong companies.

#### **Innovative Real Estate and Capital Strategies**

1.  **"Rethinking Retail" (Omni-Channel):** Agree Realty recognized that physical stores are still critical for modern retail, especially as the line between online and in-store shopping blurred (the "omni-channel" trend). They focus on properties, such as freestanding buildings, that allow retailers to easily offer new services like *Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS)*, curbside pickup, and drive-through lanes.
2.  **Focus on "Fungible" Real Estate:** To protect against a tenant's failure, they focus on generic building layouts—referred to as "fungible rectangles"—that can be easily converted and leased to a new retailer without expensive remodeling. This lowers their risk if a tenant goes bankrupt.
3.  **Innovative Fundraising (Forward Equity):** They were a pioneer in the net lease sector for using a capital-raising tool called a **"forward equity offering."** This allows them to raise money for future property acquisitions at a known price, providing a major financial advantage and stability in executing their growth plans.
4.  **Maintaining a "Fortress" Balance Sheet (Headwind Defense):** The company made a deliberate choice to use less debt compared to many competitors. This conservative approach means they are better positioned to weather **headwinds like rising interest rates**, which hurt companies with a lot of near-term debt.

#### **Tailwinds and Present Status**

1.  **Major Tailwinds (COVID-19):** The global disruptions of 2020 demonstrated the success of their essential, recession-resistant strategy. While many retail properties struggled, Agree Realty's portfolio—focused on grocery and home improvement—remained highly resilient, with rent collections staying strong.
2.  **The Current Goal:** Today, the mission remains to **"Rethink Retail"** by being the industry leader in acquiring and developing properties net leased to the strongest, most essential, and *omni-channel* focused retailers in the U.S., all with the ultimate goal of providing consistent, growing, and predictable income for their shareholders. The company pays a monthly dividend, which is an unusual schedule that many investors find attractive for generating passive income.

## Moat Analysis

Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) is a net lease Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), and its moat is less about owning unique technology and more about a superior, repeatable financial and real estate strategy.

### Moat Analysis and Key Differentiators

#### 1. Low Cost of Capital and Financial Discipline (The Primary Moat)

*   **Financial Advantage:** ADC's most significant competitive edge is its superior and lower cost of capital compared to many peers. This is a "virtuous cycle" where a high stock valuation allows them to issue new stock at favorable prices, securing cheaper funds for new investments.
*   **Balance Sheet Strength:** The company maintains a highly conservative, "fortress" balance sheet with low leverage and a strong investment-grade credit rating (e.g., BBB+). This financial stability makes debt cheaper and easier to secure, further lowering their overall cost of capital.
*   **Investment Spread:** The low cost of capital allows ADC to purchase the highest quality properties—which generally have lower cap rates (initial yield)—and still earn an attractive, profitable spread between their borrowing/equity cost and the property's yield. Competitors with a higher cost of capital cannot compete for these same high-quality assets.

#### 2. Portfolio Quality and Specialized Market Position

*   **Superior Tenant Credit:** ADC boasts one of the highest percentages of rent derived from **Investment-Grade credit tenants** (around 68-68.2%) in the net lease sector. These tenants are financially strong, making their rental income highly predictable and resilient during economic downturns.
*   **Focus on 'Mission-Critical' Retail:** The company strictly invests in retail properties that are essential, recession-resistant, and crucial to the tenant’s operations, such as grocery stores, home improvement centers, tire and auto service, and off-price retail. This focus on necessity-based retail makes the properties e-commerce-resistant.
*   **Ground Lease Expertise:** A unique component of ADC’s portfolio is its substantial allocation to **ground leases** (around 11% of rent). Ground leases are generally considered a higher investment quality because they are senior to a traditional lease, meaning the landlord owns the land, and the tenant owns the building, making the contract very sticky.

#### 3. Sticky Contracts and Pricing Power

*   **Contract Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The contracts are highly recurring and sticky due to the **triple net lease** structure and long terms. The tenant is responsible for nearly all property operating expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance), which minimizes the landlord's risk and management responsibilities.
*   **Long Lease Terms:** The weighted-average remaining lease term for the portfolio is long (e.g., 8.8 years for new acquisitions and 10.0 years for ground leases), locking in stable cash flow for many years.
*   **Pricing Power Mechanism:** ADC's primary pricing power comes from two areas:
    *   **Acquisition Pricing:** Their low cost of capital gives them a clear advantage in successfully bidding for the best assets.
    *   **Contractual Escalations:** The leases typically include **annual rent escalations** (often fixed percentages or tied to an inflation index like CPI), which provides built-in, predictable annual rent growth regardless of the economic climate.

#### 4. Reasons for Growth and Displacement Difficulty

*   **Reason for Growth (Discipline and Underwriting):** ADC's success is a result of a consistently applied, long-term, **disciplined investment strategy** and conservative underwriting. This is demonstrated by the company's historical record of over $10 billion in acquisitions versus very low dispositions over 15 years, indicating they pick and choose assets exceptionally well.
*   **Displacement Difficulty by Capital:** It would be **difficult, but not impossible,** for a competitor with more capital to easily displace ADC. Simply having more money is not enough. The competitor would also need to achieve a **lower cost of capital**—which is a major barrier—and replicate ADC's decades-long track record of disciplined underwriting, deep tenant relationships, and proven execution on ground leases and omni-channel assets.

#### 5. Network Effects and Innovation

*   **Network Effects (Relationship/Expertise Network):** ADC does not have a traditional social network effect, but it benefits from a **relationship network and specialized expertise.** Their track record and financial strength make them a preferred capital partner for the nation's leading retailers for sale-leaseback transactions or new development projects (Developer Funding Programs). This "deep tenant relationship" creates a robust and proprietary pipeline of new deals, which is an advantage over smaller players.
*   **R&D and Innovation:** As a real estate company, ADC has **minimal to no R&D spending** (typical R&D expenses are reported as $0M). Their "innovation" is **strategic**, focusing on understanding and acquiring the real estate that is crucial for the future of **omni-channel retail** (e.g., free-standing stores that can handle buy-online-pickup-in-store, or BOPIS). The edge is in being a *thought leader* in retail real estate strategy, not in developing technology.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of public filings, including the DEF 14A (Proxy Statement), the management incentive and compensation structure for Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) appears well-designed to align the interests of its executive team with those of its shareholders.

### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Significant Direct Ownership:** The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has a substantial personal stake, directly owning 0.58% of the company's shares, which was valued at approximately $45–$46 million as of the latest data. This considerable ownership position strongly links his personal wealth to the long-term performance of the stock.
2.  **Mandatory Stock Ownership Guidelines:** The company has adopted formal stock ownership guidelines for its Executive Chairman, CEO, CFO, COO, Chief Growth Officer, General Counsel, and non-employee directors. These guidelines require key management and directors to hold and retain a significant amount of the company's common stock, further aligning their interests with shareholders.
3.  **Active Buying by Directors:** Recent insider transactions, such as purchases by a director, including shares acquired through a dividend reinvestment plan, indicate a continued commitment to increasing their ownership stake.

### **Compensation Structure and Incentives**

4.  **Performance-Weighted Compensation:** The CEO's total compensation is heavily weighted towards performance-based pay, with approximately 89.2% derived from bonuses, company stock, and options, and only 10.8% from base salary. This structure minimizes fixed pay and strongly incentivizes value creation tied to company performance.
5.  **Shareholder-Relevant Performance Metrics:** Executive incentive awards are explicitly linked to key financial metrics that directly impact shareholder value for a REIT. These metrics include **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share**, **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, and **Net Debt to Annualized Recurring EBITDA**.
6.  **Robust Governance and Controls:** The compensation program includes a **"claw-back" policy** for cash and equity awards and is periodically reviewed by an independent third-party consultant to ensure it remains competitive and fair. This oversight helps mitigate the risk of executives lining their own pockets through non-performance-based means.

### **Conclusion**

Based on the structure, ADC's management appears to have **sufficient incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders**.

*   The combination of a very high percentage of variable pay (89.2%), a significant personal equity stake for the CEO, and the use of relevant shareholder-centric performance metrics (AFFO/share and Relative TSR) creates a strong framework for alignment.
*   The mandatory stock ownership guidelines and clawback provisions serve as powerful deterrents against short-term opportunism, encouraging long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.

## Price History

Based on a technical and fundamental analysis of Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) price history:

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The current stock price for Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) is approximately **\$71.26**, with the 52-week trading range spanning from a low of **\$67.58** to a high of **\$79.65**.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** The stock is currently trading approximately **5.45%** above its 52-week low of \$67.58. This indicates the stock is near the lower end of its annual trading range.

3.  **Technical Analysis: Is it Trading Low?** The stock is not at an extreme *oversold* level based on a recent technical analysis, but it is in the "lower part of a horizontal trend" in the short term, which one source suggested may present a good buying opportunity. After reaching a 52-week high of around \$80 in April, the stock has experienced a "pullback" to its current level around \$71, causing some long-term investors to view it as "attractively priced".

4.  **Significant Price Movements (Last Few Months):** The stock price saw a large dip near the end of 2023, where it traded near a low of **\$53.44**, indicating a substantial sell-off at that time. It then recovered strongly, climbing to its recent 52-week high of nearly **\$80** in April of the current year, marking a significant upswing over a few months.

5.  **Explanation for Recent Drop (Post-April Pullback):** The recent drop from the \$80 high to the current \$71 price is attributed to a general market pullback and "macro uncertainty," despite Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) often benefiting from lower interest rates. The price decline appears to be driven by market sentiment rather than company-specific fundamentals.

6.  **Positive Corporate News:** A significant positive development for the company was its credit rating upgrade to 'A' from Fitch Ratings in August, which provides a cost of capital advantage over smaller, lower-rated peers. The company also reported strong earnings and revenue growth in the first quarter of the year, with a significant increase in property acquisitions.

## Long Thesis

Agree Realty Corporation is an elite landlord focused on owning freestanding properties leased to financially strong, essential retailers (like grocery stores, home improvement centers, and discount chains). This results in highly reliable, recession-proof rental income. The stock is positioned to rise because: 1. Near Term: The company possesses the sector's lowest cost of borrowing and a massive cash reserve. This allows management to aggressively acquire the highest quality properties immediately, leading to accelerated and predictable rental income and earnings growth. 2. Long Term: The disciplined focus on only the best, most critical retail locations, coupled with long-term leases that often include guaranteed annual rent increases, ensures stable, growing profits. This consistent financial growth is expected to support a steady increase in the company’s attractive monthly dividend, attracting and retaining long-term income-focused investors.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This optimistic scenario relies on the following key assumptions holding true: 1. Interest Rate Stability: The market's current volatility regarding rising interest rates must stabilize or decline, which will lower ADC's cost of capital and further boost acquisition profitability. 2. Tenant Resilience: ADC's major tenants (essential retailers like Walmart and Dollar General) must maintain their strong financial health and successfully resist displacement by e-commerce, ensuring long-term rental payments. 3. Continued Discipline: Management must continue its conservative financial strategy (keeping debt low) and maintain its strict standards for acquiring only the highest-quality properties, avoiding the temptation to chase risky or unprofitable deals just to meet growth targets.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) presents a strong argument based on the company's established strengths (credit quality, conservative management). However, a bear case can be constructed by identifying flaws in the thesis's assumptions, scrutinizing its financial claims, and highlighting inherent risks in its operational strategy.

### Flaws and Faults in the Long Thesis (Bear Case Critique)

#### **1. Critique on Financial Claims and Liquidity:**

*   **The "Massive Cash Reserve" is Primarily Debt/Equity Capacity:** The claim of possessing a "massive cash reserve" is misleading, as the company's significant liquidity (reported at \$2.3 billion in Q2 2025) largely consists of undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility and unsettled forward equity proceeds, not cash on the balance sheet. This "reserve" is capital that must still be deployed (which will increase share count or debt) or is debt-based.
*   **Leverage is Moderate, not Minimal:** ADC's net debt to annualized recurring EBITDA was approximately 5.47x as of June 2025, a leverage ratio that some financial metrics consider elevated for safety, which contradicts the long thesis's implied "low debt" profile. While the company utilizes forward equity to manage its pro-forma leverage, this highlights a reliance on equity capital markets to maintain its balance sheet strength.
*   **"Lowest Cost of Borrowing" Is an Unproven Assumption:** While the company is investment-grade and has access to competitive financing (e.g., a Q2 2025 bond at a 5.35% all-in rate), the claim of having the *sector's lowest* cost of borrowing lacks explicit peer comparison and is highly dependent on a volatile, high-interest-rate environment that could quickly shift.

#### **2. Critique on Acquisition Strategy and Growth Rate:**

*   **Acquisitions May Not Be the "Highest Quality":** ADC's weighted-average cap rate for new acquisitions in Q2 2025 was approximately 7.1%. While a higher cap rate implies better yield, the *highest quality* net lease assets (like prime bank or essential convenience store locations) often trade in the sub-6% cap rate range, suggesting ADC is either purchasing properties with shorter lease terms, less-than-prime real estate, or a higher proportion of non-investment-grade tenants to hit their volume targets.
*   **"Accelerated" Earnings Growth is Modest:** The thesis suggests "accelerated and predictable rental income and earnings growth." However, the year-over-year Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) per share growth was a modest 1.7% in Q2 2025 and 2.4% for the first half of 2025, which is not an "accelerated" growth rate that typically drives significant stock appreciation.
*   **Dividend Growth is Slowing Relative to Peers:** The company's monthly dividend increase of 2.4% year-over-year (as of Q2 2025) is relatively slow, which may not be enough to attract or retain income-focused investors looking for a significant increase in purchasing power.

#### **3. Critique on "Recession-Proof" Tenant/Concentration Risk:**

*   **Significant Tenant Concentration Risk Remains:** Despite broad diversification efforts, a high percentage of Annualized Base Rent (ABR) is still concentrated, with the **top 18 tenants comprising over 53% of ABR** as of March 31, 2025. A major credit event or financial stress for one of these top tenants could disproportionately impact the entire portfolio's revenue.
*   **"Essential Retailer" Thesis is Vulnerable to Shifting Trends:** While tenants like discount and dollar stores are "essential," the profitability of their low-margin business model is heavily exposed to factors like inflation, minimum wage increases, and the persistent threat of major economic competitors (e.g., Amazon, Walmart) expanding their own e-commerce and logistics networks.

***

### **Bear Case Thesis for Agree Realty Corporation (ADC)**

The bear case for Agree Realty Corporation argues that its premium valuation and aggressive growth plans are highly dependent on favorable capital markets and that the returns generated do not fully justify the underlying risks, making the stock susceptible to a downward re-rating.

1.  **Risk of Spread Compression in a "Higher for Longer" Rate Environment:** The core of the long thesis—aggressive acquisitions—is reliant on maintaining a profitable spread between the yield on new properties (cap rate) and the cost of capital. If interest rates fail to stabilize or rise further, the cost of capital will increase, directly compressing this spread and making new acquisitions less accretive to earnings, thereby crippling the main growth engine.
2.  **Dilutive Equity Issuance to Maintain Acquisition Pace:** The company’s ability to execute a large acquisition volume is heavily dependent on continuously raising equity capital (via forward sales) to manage its leverage ratio and fund deals. This constant issuance of new stock creates dilution that acts as a headwind against meaningful AFFO per share growth, limiting total return to investors.
3.  **Vulnerability to Tenant or Geographic Concentration:** Despite its quality, the portfolio has a material concentration risk where over half of the rent is derived from a small number of top tenants and a few key markets. Any industry-specific downturn, unexpected tenant bankruptcy, or unfavorable economic event in a core state could have an outsized negative impact on revenue stability, challenging the "recession-proof" narrative.
4.  **Premium Valuation for Modest Growth:** The stock trades at a premium multiple compared to its projected low single-digit (sub-3%) AFFO per share growth. Investors could rotate out of the stock and into peers offering comparable stability and yield without the premium valuation, or into other REIT sub-sectors offering higher growth, leading to stock price underperformance.

## Next Steps

This analysis is comprehensive, clearly outlining the bull and bear cases. The next step is to investigate the most critical quantitative claims that either support the *Moat* (low cost of capital) or invalidate the *Bear Case* (risk from growth and valuation).

Here are the important questions left unanswered for further investigation:

1.  **Quantifying the Cost of Capital and Spread Moat (Financial Benchmarking):**
    *   **Question:** How does ADC's cost of capital (WACC) and its acquisition spread (Cap Rate minus WACC) compare explicitly to its largest net lease peers (e.g., Realty Income (O), National Retail Properties (NNN))?
    *   **Need to investigate:** While the search suggests an acquisition cap rate of **7.3%** and an approximate WACC of **5.6% to 6.25%**, resulting in a spread of **105 to 170 basis points**, a direct, recent peer comparison is needed to validate the "lowest cost of capital" claim, which is ADC's core competitive advantage.

2.  **Evaluating Portfolio Risk from Non-Investment Grade Tenants:**
    *   **Question:** What is the actual composition (by tenant type and financial health/industry exposure) of the approximately **32%** of Annualized Base Rent (ABR) derived from the *non-investment-grade* and *not-rated* tenants?
    *   **Need to investigate:** We know the high-quality percentage is strong, but to fully assess the "recession-proof" nature, the riskier segment needs a deep dive, especially concerning their lease terms and financial stability outside of a credit rating.

3.  **Analyzing Near-Term Lease Expiration/Re-Leasing Risk:**
    *   **Question:** What is the annual schedule of lease expirations (the "lease expiration ladder") over the next three to five years, and what percentage of ABR is at risk in those periods?
    *   **Need to investigate:** The overall Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term (WALT) is approximately **8.0 years**, which is good, but any disproportionate concentration of lease expirations in the near-term could expose the company to unexpected re-leasing costs or lower renewal rates.

4.  **Deep Dive into the Ground Lease Advantage:**
    *   **Question:** How much of a cap rate (initial yield) difference does ADC typically see between its traditional net lease properties and its ground lease acquisitions, and how does this affect the long-term total return profile?
    *   **Need to investigate:** Ground leases (around **11% of ABR**) are a key differentiator. Quantifying the lower acquisition yield (which implies higher security/moat) will solidify whether this segment truly provides superior risk-adjusted returns or if it is merely a smaller portfolio component.

5.  **Verifying Management's Performance Incentives:**
    *   **Question:** What were the **specific, measurable financial targets** (e.g., a minimum *AFFO per share growth rate* or *Total Shareholder Return (TSR)* ranking) that management must achieve to earn their full performance-based equity awards?
    *   **Need to investigate:** This will confirm if the incentive structure is truly aligned with *accelerating* shareholder returns, or if the targets are modest enough to be easily met, as implied by the bear case's critique of their modest AFFO per share growth.
