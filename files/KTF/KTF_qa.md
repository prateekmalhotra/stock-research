## Business Summary

The DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) operates as an investment fund that gathers money from its shareholders and primarily uses those funds to purchase debt securities, known as municipal bonds, which are issued by U.S. state and local governments. These bonds finance public projects, and in return, the Trust receives regular interest payments. The main appeal to its customers, who are typically high-net-worth individual investors across the U.S. seeking tax efficiency, is that this interest income is usually exempt from federal income taxes. The Trust generates its income by collecting these tax-exempt payments and distributing them to shareholders, often utilizing borrowed funds (leverage) to buy additional bonds and potentially boost the distributions it pays out.

## Business Model Risk

The Trust faces significant interest rate risk in the near term, meaning if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the market value of the long-term bonds KTF already holds drops, directly harming the fund’s asset value. This risk is amplified because KTF uses leverage (borrowed money); when rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases faster than the income the bonds generate, squeezing the fund's earnings. A key long-term risk is credit risk, where a municipality could fail to repay its debt due to severe financial distress, causing a permanent loss of principal, as occurred during historical crises like the Puerto Rican debt default. Finally, KTF's entire business model hinges on the tax-exempt status of municipal bond interest; any adverse change in federal tax law eliminating this benefit would remove KTF's primary competitive advantage, severely damaging investor demand and the fund's market position.

## Company History

This history lesson details the DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF), now known as Deutsche Municipal Income Trust, focusing on its foundational purpose and its journey through various financial cycles, which is concluding with its planned termination.

### 1. Inception and Foundational Purpose (1988)

1.  **Date and Structure:** The DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) was established on October 20, 1988, as a **closed-end fund** (CEF). Unlike a typical mutual fund, a closed-end fund sells a fixed number of shares in a one-time public offering, and after that, the shares are traded on a stock exchange like any regular stock.
2.  **The Core Goal (Why it was Founded):** The primary objective was to provide investors with a high level of **current income that is exempt from federal income tax**.
3.  **The Investment Strategy:** To achieve this tax-free income goal, the fund primarily invests in high-quality, investment-grade municipal securities, which are essentially bonds issued by state and local governments to finance projects like roads, schools, and hospitals.

### 2. Innovative Strategy: The Use of Leverage

1.  **The "Innovative Solution" (The Core Strategy):** To offer a *higher* income yield than a simple bond fund, the DWS Municipal Income Trust employs **leverage**, which means the fund borrows money, often by issuing its own preferred stock, to buy even more municipal bonds.
2.  **Amplifying Returns:** When the income earned from the bonds is greater than the cost of the borrowing, this strategy successfully amplifies the returns and helps the fund pay its high, tax-exempt monthly distributions to its shareholders.

### 3. Tailwinds (Favorable Market Conditions)

1.  **Long-Term Low-Interest Rates:** The single most fortunate tailwind was the extended period of generally low interest rates in the U.S. economy, especially in the years following the 2008 Financial Crisis.
2.  **Low Borrowing Costs:** During this time, the fund's cost of leverage (the interest paid on the borrowed money) was very low, allowing it to maintain a high-income advantage for its shareholders with minimal risk to its core strategy.
3.  **Demand for Tax-Exempt Income:** A consistent, high demand from wealthy investors for investments that shield income from federal taxes created a steady buyer base for the municipal bonds the fund held and the fund's shares themselves.

### 4. Headwinds and Problems Faced (Past and Present)

1.  **The 2008 Financial Crisis Impact (Credit Risk Headwind):** While municipal bonds are generally very safe, the 2008 crisis hurt the municipal bond insurance business, which led to sharp drops in the value of many municipal bonds, causing a significant, but temporary, financial headache for the fund.
2.  **The Great Interest Rate Reversal (Current Major Headwind):** The most serious current problem began when the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates starting in 2022 to fight inflation.
3.  **Leverage Becomes a Problem:** This major change caused the fund's cost of borrowing (its leverage) to rise sharply, squeezing the profit margin between the interest it earned on its bonds and the higher interest it had to pay on its borrowed money.
4.  **Distribution Issues:** In recent years, the fund's investment performance has been underwhelming, with a concerning sign that some of its monthly distributions to shareholders were essentially a "return of capital," meaning they were paying back the investors’ original money rather than true income earned. This erodes the fund's net asset value (NAV) over time.

### 5. The Ultimate "Solution" (Termination)

1.  **The Final Decision:** Due to these long-term performance issues and the pressure from the high-interest rate environment, the Board of Trustees approved the fund's complete **termination and liquidation** in early 2024.
2.  **The End Date:** The process of liquidating all assets and paying out the final distribution to common shareholders is scheduled to be completed no later than November 30, 2026.
3.  **The Wind-Down Strategy:** As part of this wind-down, the fund's management announced an increase in the monthly distribution rate (to at least 7% of NAV) to return capital to investors in an orderly manner before the final closing. This effectively changes the fund's immediate goal from long-term income generation to a planned, multi-year return of shareholder capital.

## Moat Analysis

The DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) is a publicly traded Closed-End Fund (CEF) that invests in municipal bonds. Its moat is not a traditional business moat but rather a combination of structural and legacy advantages that are currently under significant competitive pressure, especially given the fund's scheduled liquidation.

### Moat Analysis and Differentiation

1.  **Tax-Exempt Income Mandate:** The fund's primary "moat" feature is the **tax-exempt nature** of its distributions at the federal level, which is the core appeal for its target investors (high-income individuals). This structural advantage makes its yield highly competitive against taxable investments, but this is a feature shared by all municipal bond funds.
2.  **Long Operating History (Legacy Advantage):** The fund has been operating since 1988, which translates to a nearly four-decade track record and familiarity among financial advisors and investors. This long history provides a legacy base of investors and a reputation in the municipal bond space.
3.  **Leverage and Closed-End Structure:** As a CEF, KTF uses borrowing (leverage) to amplify the income it generates for shareholders, which can result in a higher dividend yield compared to non-leveraged mutual funds or ETFs. This structure also means its shares trade on an exchange, which is different from a typical mutual fund.
4.  **Specialized Focus on Revenue Bonds:** The fund has a strategy of primarily focusing on municipal **revenue bonds**, which are backed by the cash flow from specific projects (like toll roads or utility fees) rather than a city's general tax revenue. This specialized focus differentiates the composition of its portfolio, but does not provide a unique barrier to entry.

### Pricing Power and Market Position

1.  **Limited Pricing Power:** The fund has an effective expense ratio (including interest expense from leverage) of over 3%, which is relatively high in the investment world. In a highly competitive market, this suggests the fund does *not* possess significant pricing power, as competitors like BlackRock have a scale advantage that may allow for lower fees.
2.  **Competitive Market Position:** KTF operates in a crowded market space, competing directly with municipal income closed-end funds managed by massive, well-capitalized firms like BlackRock, Nuveen, and Invesco. These larger competitors often have more resources, stronger brand recognition, and immense distribution networks.

### Reason for Growth and Displacement Risk

1.  **Reason for Past Growth:** KTF grew into a multi-hundred-million-dollar fund due to the combined appeal of its **long operating history** and its ability to deliver a **tax-exempt, leveraged-boosted monthly income stream** to investors over several decades.
2.  **Easy Displacement by Competitors:** KTF can be easily displaced by firms with more capital because the core product—tax-exempt municipal bond exposure—is a commodity. Furthermore, the fund has faced underperformance and is scheduled to liquidate by November 2026, which is the ultimate sign of failure to maintain a strong competitive edge.
3.  **Customer Stickiness and Contracts:** The customers are the shareholders, and their "contract" is simply owning a share that trades daily on a public exchange; therefore, they are *not* sticky. Investors are only "sticky" as long as the fund provides a compelling tax-free monthly distribution that they cannot easily replicate elsewhere.

### Network Effects and Innovation

1.  **Minimal Network Effects:** Investment funds, in general, do not benefit from a classic network effect; there is no increased value to a shareholder simply because more people own the fund. The benefit is to the fund manager, DWS, through its existing brand and asset gathering capabilities.
2.  **No R&D or Constant Innovation:** As a fund that buys and manages municipal bonds, KTF does not invest in research and development (R&D) or need to constantly innovate its product. Its edge relies on the skill of its portfolio managers in selecting bonds and managing its debt (leverage) effectively, which is an execution risk, not an innovation moat.
3.  **Focus on Leverage:** The main action the company takes to ensure a solid income is the **use of leverage** (borrowed money) to buy more bonds, increasing the size of the portfolio and the potential income for shareholders. However, this strategy also amplifies risk and contributes to its high expense ratio.

## Catalyst Analysis

The analysis of catalysts for DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) is largely driven by its specific structure as a closed-end fund (CEF) with a scheduled termination date.

### Near-Term Catalysts (Leading to November 2026)

1.  **Liquidation and NAV Convergence:** The most significant catalyst is the fund's scheduled termination and **orderly liquidation by November 30, 2026**. Since the fund's shares have historically traded at a discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV), the liquidation process is expected to push the stock price towards its NAV as assets are sold and distributed, thereby narrowing or eliminating the discount.
2.  **Increased Investor Distribution:** The fund recently increased its monthly distribution rate to an annualized 7% (as of September 2025). This higher payout can attract income-seeking investors, which may increase demand for the shares and potentially reduce the price's discount to NAV.
3.  **Positive Municipal Bond Market Movements:** KTF invests in municipal bonds, so a general rally in the bond market (often caused by falling interest rates) would directly increase the value of its holdings, boosting its Net Asset Value (NAV). A higher NAV would directly support a higher share price.

### Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 2026)

1.  **None Due to Termination:** The fund has a firm termination date of November 30, 2026, which makes a traditional "long-term" strategy or catalyst analysis beyond this date irrelevant. All catalysts are focused on the realization of value leading up to and including the final distribution at termination.

### Management Commentary and Strategy (from Recent Shareholder Reports)

1.  **Focus on Orderly Wind-Down:** Management's primary strategy and focus, particularly from the recently elected trustees, is on executing an **orderly wind-down** of the fund's operations and portfolio leading up to the 2026 liquidation.
2.  **Enhancing Shareholder Return:** The decision to increase the monthly distribution rate to an annualized 7% was a strategic move designed by management to **enhance investor returns** during the fund's final phase.
3.  **Governance and Accountability:** Recent appointments of new trustees in September 2025 underscored the fund's commitment to **governance transparency and accountability** in managing risks and shareholder interests during the wind-down period.

## Management Record

This analysis of the management of DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) is focused on providing relevant information for an investor, including track record, key decisions, and future strategy.

### **I. Fund Management and Structure**

1.  **Investment Advisor:** The fund's investment advisor is DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc., the US-based asset management arm of DWS Group, a major global asset manager. The fund was established in 1988, giving it a long history of nearly 40 years under the same institutional umbrella.
2.  **Portfolio Management Team:** The fund is currently managed by a team that includes Michael J. Generazo and Chad H. Farrington. The management team, as a whole, has a stable tenure, with the longest-serving manager having a tenure of approximately 15.7 years, and the average tenure being 9.8 years.
3.  **Key Executive Background:** Michael J. Generazo has been a Director at DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc. since 1999, demonstrating a long-term commitment to the firm and its municipal bond strategy. Chad H. Farrington, CFA, joined DWS in 2018 as a Managing Director and Co-Head of Municipal Bond Strategy, bringing over 20 years of prior experience, including running a high-yield municipal fund and working at Fitch Ratings.
4.  **Oversight Leadership:** The firm’s Head of Fixed Income for the Americas is George Catrambone, who oversees the Active Fixed Income platform, having been with DWS (or its predecessor) since 2006 (with a brief time at BlackRock). His background is noted for risk management, operational excellence, and building scalable processes for DWS.
5.  **Previous Management:** The change in the fund's name and investment advisor title from "Deutsche Municipal Income Trust" to "DWS Municipal Income Trust" was a rebranding effort in 2018 by the parent company, DWS Group, rather than a material change in the fundamental investment advisor entity.

### **II. Track Record and Shareholder Value**

6.  **Long-Term Track Record:** Since its IPO in 1988, a $1,000 hypothetical investment in KTF, with reinvested dividends, would have grown to about $6,998, representing a compound annual growth rate of 5.78% over 37 years.
7.  **Performance Critique:** External analysis has noted that the fund's long-term performance was generally underwhelming, with a declining Net Asset Value (NAV) and distributions that historically failed to be fully covered by net investment income [cite: 4 (from search 1), 10 (from search 1)].
8.  **Management Promises (Strategy):** The core investment objective has consistently been to provide high current income exempt from federal income tax by investing primarily in investment-grade, tax-exempt municipal securities. The fund consistently employs leverage, with an effective leverage percentage of approximately 35.50% as of late 2025, to enhance income.
9.  **Key Decision - Share Repurchase Program:** Management delivered value by periodically extending an open market share repurchase program, authorized to purchase shares when they trade at a discount to NAV, which is a mechanism to stabilize or boost the share price.

### **III. Future Strategy and Key Decisions**

10. **Future Strategy & Vision: Termination:** The single most important decision regarding the fund’s future is the Board of Trustees’ approval of its **termination and liquidation**, with a final distribution to shareholders scheduled for no later than November 30, 2026. This decision eliminates the long-term management challenge of maintaining NAV and market performance.
11. **Management's Final Value Delivery:** Concurrent with the termination announcement, management's Board approved a significant increase in the monthly distribution rate to an annualized target of at least 7% of NAV until the fund is liquidated. This is a strategic move to return capital to shareholders and close the discount to NAV in the lead-up to the final payout.
12. **Context of Liquidation:** The liquidation decision for KTF and a sister fund (KSM) followed pressure from a hedge fund activist, often called a "Saba victory," and suggested DWS was no longer interested in managing the specific closed-end fund business. The management team chose a straightforward liquidation over other options like a tender offer or fund conversion.
13. **Investor Popularity and Coverage:** The fund is followed by various investment research groups focused on closed-end funds (CEFs), a measure of its popularity within that specialized investor community [cite: 4 (from search 1)]. The liquidation itself brought significant attention and commentary in the CEF market.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF)'s structure and recent actions, here is an analysis of its management incentives and compensation:

### Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF)

1.  **Advisor Compensation Structure (The AUM Incentive):**
    *   The Fund pays an annual **Management Fee (0.81% of common assets)** to its Advisor, DWS Investment Management Americas, Inc. (DIMA).
    *   This fee is based on the Fund's Assets Under Management (AUM), which creates an inherent, standard conflict of interest for the Advisor: the incentive is to maintain or grow AUM, even if the fund trades at a wide discount to Net Asset Value (NAV), to ensure a stable fee stream.

2.  **Portfolio Manager Compensation (Indirect/Corporate Focus):**
    *   The portfolio managers are employees of the Advisor (DWS), and their compensation is paid by the Advisor, not directly by KTF.
    *   Variable compensation for DWS executives is partially tied to broader corporate metrics like the Adjusted Cost-Income Ratio and Net Flows (AUM growth) for the DWS Group, not the specific NAV or market price performance of the KTF common shares.
    *   This structure dilutes the direct financial incentive for the portfolio managers to maximize KTF's individual shareholder returns, as their primary loyalty and career progression is tied to the parent company, DWS.

3.  **Insider Ownership (Director/Officer Alignment):**
    *   The Fund's proxy statements require disclosure of the dollar range of equity securities owned by each Trustee and Officer in KTF and the broader DWS fund complex.
    *   While the specific percentage is not publicly available in the search results, the requirement for directors and officers to hold Fund shares is a governance mechanism designed to align their interests with those of common shareholders ("higher the better").

4.  **Board Compensation (Service-Based):**
    *   Independent Trustees are compensated with cash fees (retainer and/or meeting fees) paid by the Fund and the DWS fund complex.
    *   This fixed, service-based fee structure is typical for closed-end funds and may not provide a strong incentive to take risks or aggressively pursue actions to close the NAV discount, other than fulfilling their fiduciary duty.

### Conclusion: Alignment of Interests

Management's incentives were historically mixed, presenting a common structural conflict for closed-end funds, but recent actions strongly suggest an alignment with shareholder value:

*   **Incentive to Line Pockets (Structural Risk):** The primary **0.81% management fee is based on AUM**, incentivizing the Advisor (DWS) to keep the fund operating indefinitely, regardless of common shareholder returns.
*   **Incentive to Act for Shareholders (Decisive Action):** The Board of Trustees approved the **termination and liquidation of KTF** by November 30, 2026. This is the strongest possible action in favor of common shareholders as it forces the realization of the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share, eliminating any market discount and effectively realizing shareholder value.
*   **Final Judgment:** The decision to liquidate, often an outcome of shareholder pressure, demonstrates that the **fiduciary duty of the Board ultimately overrode the Advisor's structural incentive to maintain AUM.** For the final period until liquidation, the clear incentive for both the Board and Advisor is to manage the portfolio to maximize the final NAV to be distributed.

## Price History

Based on the recent price history and market context for the DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF), here is an analysis:

### **KTF Price History and Technical Analysis**

1.  **Current Position Relative to 52-Week Low:** The DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) is currently trading approximately **8.84%** above its 52-week low of $8.48. This calculation is based on an approximate recent price of $9.23 [cite: 10 (from first search as source 7 in that search), 9 (from first search)].

2.  **Recent Price Momentum ("Up Bigly"):** The fund has seen a strong short-term price surge, with a momentum gain of approximately **+7.76% over the last three months** [cite: 9 (from first search)]. However, its longer-term performance remains negative, showing a decline of about -5.56% over the past year [cite: 9 (from first search)].

3.  **Reason for the Short-Term Gain (The "Why"):** KTF is a leveraged closed-end fund that primarily holds municipal bonds, making its stock price highly sensitive to the interest rate environment. The recent surge is likely driven by market anticipation of future **Federal Reserve interest rate cuts**. Lowering rates benefits funds that use leverage, as it reduces their borrowing costs and typically causes the value of existing bonds to rise, which in turn boosts the fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) and share price.

4.  **Technical Analysis Outlook (Trading Low):** Technical indicators provide a mixed but cautious outlook. While the stock has rebounded strongly in the last three months, some technical analysis models indicate **sell signals** from both short and long-term moving averages. This suggests that while the stock is far from its 52-week high of $10.10, it does not present a unanimous "trading low" or "strong buy" signal based on popular technical metrics.

5.  **Underlying Risk Factor:** The fund’s price movement is heavily influenced by its structure and underlying market. As a closed-end fund, KTF utilizes a significant amount of leverage (around 35.36% of total assets), which amplifies both gains during periods of falling rates and losses when rates are high. Furthermore, a four-month-old analysis criticized its long-term performance, citing declining NAV and distributions failing to cover payouts [cite: 1 (from first search as source 4 in that search)].

---

## Long Thesis

The bull case for KTF is purely a value realization story tied to its required shutdown by November 2026. The stock currently trades at a price cheaper than the actual value of its assets (the Net Asset Value). Since the fund must liquidate, every shareholder is essentially guaranteed to receive the full asset value per share when the fund closes, which should push the stock price higher between now and the end date. Furthermore, management has committed to paying out a very high monthly distribution (targeting 7% of asset value annually) until the final payment. This high return potential is maximized if U.S. interest rates fall, as lower rates would instantly increase the market value of the fund's bonds, boosting the total cash returned to shareholders at liquidation.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. The fund must complete its planned termination and distribute assets to shareholders no later than November 2026, forcing the stock price to converge with the full Net Asset Value. 2. Interest rates must remain stable or decline modestly over the next two years, which prevents the value of the fund's bond holdings from dropping and helps support the high monthly income payouts. 3. The fund's underlying municipal bonds do not suffer significant credit losses (i.e., no major city or state defaults on its debt) before the final liquidation occurs. 4. Management successfully sells the portfolio assets in an orderly process without having to accept discounted prices.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) hinges on a simple convergence-to-NAV story amplified by high yield and falling rates. However, several critical flaws and risks undermine the certainty of this predicted return. The main faults lie in the assumption that the Net Asset Value (NAV) will hold its value, the high-yield payment is "free" money, and that the liquidation process will be perfectly executed.

Here is the bear case critique, identifying the flaws and faults in the thesis:

1.  **Guaranteed Value Realization is Overstated Due to NAV Decay:** The core argument that a shareholder is "guaranteed to receive the full asset value per share" is misleading because the target value (the final Net Asset Value, or NAV) is not static. The fund's distribution target of at least 7% of NAV annually is explicitly expected to include a **Return of Capital (ROC)**, which means the payment is literally part of the fund's principal being paid back, thereby *reducing* the future liquidation value (NAV) per share.

2.  **Limited Upside from Discount Convergence:** The premise of a large "value realization" is significantly weakened by the current valuation. As of late October 2025, KTF's stock price ($9.19) trades at a relatively small **-3.36% discount** to its NAV ($9.51), limiting the potential capital gain from convergence over the next year. This convergence is likely already priced into the stock following the termination announcement in March 2024.

3.  **Amplified Interest Rate Risk from High Leverage:** The thesis underestimates the risk if interest rates *do not* fall, or if they rise. KTF operates with high effective leverage of **35.50%** of total assets. A significant portion of the fund's expense ratio is its **2.35% interest expense** on this leverage. Any unexpected rise in the short-term rates used to finance this leverage will increase the fund's borrowing costs, further eroding its net investment income and accelerating the NAV decay mentioned above.

4.  **Forced Selling Risk Undermines "Orderly Process":** The long thesis assumes management "successfully sells the portfolio assets in an orderly process." However, the mandatory termination deadline of November 2026 creates a risk of **forced selling**. Should the municipal bond market experience poor liquidity, high volatility, or a sharp downturn in the months leading up to the deadline, the manager may be forced to liquidate large positions at discounted prices to meet the termination deadline, resulting in a liquidation value (final NAV) that is lower than current marks.

5.  **Lower-Grade Municipal Bond Risk:** While the fund primarily invests in investment-grade bonds (Baa/BBB or better), a significant portion of its portfolio is in the lower tiers of the investment-grade spectrum. In a scenario where economic conditions worsen, these lower-rated bonds are most vulnerable to downgrades and price drops, especially with a highly-leveraged structure, leading to an accelerated decline in NAV.

---

## Next Steps

Based on your thorough analysis, especially the central factor of the mandatory liquidation by November 2026, the remaining questions should focus on the **execution of the wind-down** and the **final Net Asset Value (NAV)** realization.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered that you should investigate further:

### Next Steps to Investigate: Quantifying the Final NAV and Execution Risk

1.  **Quantify the Current NAV Decay (Return of Capital):**
    The analysis notes the 7% distribution is *expected* to contain a Return of Capital (ROC), which erodes the final payout value. You must find the most recent monthly distribution statement to determine the **actual percentage of ROC** versus net investment income, as this is the direct, quantifiable measure of NAV decay.

2.  **Determine Liquidation Progress and Leverage Reduction:**
    The bear case highlights a "forced selling risk" before the November 2026 deadline. Investigate the most recent semi-annual or annual report to see how much of the portfolio has already been sold and, critically, if the **$198.75 million in preferred share leverage has been paid down** to mitigate the risk of forced selling.

3.  **Find the Current Cost of Leverage:**
    The fund uses variable rate preferred shares, and the interest expense erodes NAV if rates are high. Search for the current (or most recent) **effective interest rate/cost of borrowing** on the VMTPS to directly quantify the high-interest expense noted in the bear case and its current impact on the NAV.

4.  **Confirm the Tax Status of the Distributions:**
    The core appeal is tax-exempt income, but the fund has made taxable capital gain distributions. Determine the most recent data on the **tax status of the current 7% distribution** to ensure the core tax-exempt income benefit is still intact for the majority of the payout, or if the ROC is a fully taxable event.

5.  **Investigate the Activist's Role and Governance:**
    The liquidation was a "Saba victory." Search for any official **settlement or agreement details with Saba Capital** to understand if the activist investor has a formal role, such as a board seat, to ensure the liquidation is executed in a shareholder-friendly manner, maximizing the final payout.

6.  **Analyze Manager Incentives for Final NAV:**
    The long thesis depends on maximizing the final NAV. Investigate whether the portfolio managers or the DWS firm have a **special bonus or incentive tied directly to the final realized NAV per share** at the time of termination. This would align management's focus with common shareholder returns during the wind-down.
