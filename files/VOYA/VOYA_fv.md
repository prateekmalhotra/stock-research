### II. Business Engine and Financial Projections (2026-2030)

The core business of Voya is divided into three segments: Wealth Solutions (Retirement), Investment Management, and Health Solutions (Employee Benefits). The revenue engine is primarily driven by **fee-based revenues** on Assets Under Management/Administration (AUM/AUA) and premiums from insurance products, with management explicitly focusing on **margin expansion** and **disciplined growth**.

#### A. Revenue Engine and Assumptions

Voya's key driver is the increase in AUM/AUA, resulting in durable fee-based revenue growth. The OneAmerica acquisition (Q1 2025) and record organic net inflows provide a strong, immediate boost. In Health Solutions, the strategy is to prioritize margin improvement (loss ratio target 77-80%) over top-line growth.

**Revenue Growth Assumptions (Conservative):**

| Year | Assumption | Rationale (Backing) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | **+4.0%** | Reflects the full-year impact of the OneAmerica acquisition (assets added in 2025), coupled with expectations for "meaningful defined contribution net inflows." |
| **2027** | **+3.0%** | Tapers off slightly, incorporating the Investment Management long-term organic growth target of at least 2%, compounded by capital market performance (assumed modest) and flat/conservative Health Solutions premiums. |
| **2028** | **+2.5%** | A conservative assumption as the short-term benefit from the acquisition fades. |
| **2029** | **+2.5%** | Continued, modest growth from long-term organic flows and market appreciation. |
| **2030** | **+2.5%** | Continued, modest growth from long-term organic flows and market appreciation. |

#### B. Margin and Net Income Projections

Voya is focused on expanding its Adjusted Operating Margin (40% in Retirement and further improvement expected in Health Solutions). The GAAP Net Income Margin for the base year 2025 was 7.48% (613 / 8,190).

**Net Income Margin Assumption (Conservative):**
We assume a conservative and slightly declining **7.0% Net Income Margin** for the entire projection period (2026-2030), which is lower than the 2025 actual of 7.48%. This is to remain conservative and account for potential non-recurring costs or conservative alternative investment returns.

#### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

The instruction requires incorporating additional income from retained net income at a reasonable ROIC rate. Voya's Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) for 2025 was 18.6%, reflecting its capital-light model. For conservatism, we will use a substantially lower, conservative ROIC.

**ROIC Assumption (Conservative):**
We will assume a conservative **5.0% ROIC** on the prior year's retained Net Income (cash).

| Year | **Revenue** (A) | **Net Income Margin** | **Net Income (Base)** (B) | **Previous Year Retained Income** (C) | **ROIC (5.0%)** (D = C * 5.0%) | **Total Net Income** (B+D) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2025** | \$8,190 | 7.48% | \$613 | - | - | **\$613** |
| **2026** | \$8,518 | 7.00% | \$596 | \$613 | \$31 | **\$627** |
| **2027** | \$8,773 | 7.00% | \$614 | \$627 | \$31 | **\$645** |
| **2028** | \$8,992 | 7.00% | \$630 | \$645 | \$32 | **\$662** |
| **2029** | \$9,217 | 7.00% | \$645 | \$662 | \$33 | **\$678** |
| **2030** | \$9,447 | 7.00% | \$661 | \$678 | \$34 | **\$695** |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

For a financial services company with a durable, fee-based business model, we will use a conservative Discount Rate and a low Terminal Growth Rate. The "cash flow" is approximated by Net Income, as per the instructions.

#### A. DCF Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative WACC proxy, well above the current long-term US Treasury yield and reflecting a reasonable Equity Risk Premium for a large-cap financial services company with solid profitability (FY2025 Adj. ROE of 18.6%) but some historical volatility.
*   **Terminal Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **1.5%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a very conservative assumption, well below the long-term expected US GDP growth rate (2-4%), reflecting maximum caution for cash flow in perpetuity.

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | **Total Net Income** (A) | **Discount Factor (9.0%)** (B) | **NPV of Cash Flow** (A * B) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2026 | \$627 | 0.917 | \$575 |
| 2027 | \$645 | 0.842 | \$543 |
| 2028 | \$662 | 0.772 | \$511 |
| 2029 | \$678 | 0.708 | \$480 |
| 2030 | \$695 | 0.650 | \$452 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026-2030)** | | | **\$2,561** |

#### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal value calculates the present value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

*   Terminal Year Cash Flow (FCF): \$695 million (2030 Net Income)
*   Perpetuity Growth Rate ($g$): 1.5%
*   Discount Rate ($r$): 9.0%

Terminal Value at EOY 2030 = FCF x (1 + $g$) / ($r$ - $g$)
Terminal Value at EOY 2030 = \$695 x (1 + 0.015) / (0.090 - 0.015)
Terminal Value at EOY 2030 = \$695 x 1.015 / 0.075
Terminal Value at EOY 2030 = **\$9,419 million**

NPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value / (1 + $r$)^Year
NPV of Terminal Value = \$9,419 / (1.090)^5
NPV of Terminal Value = \$9,419 x 0.650
NPV of Terminal Value = **\$6,122 million**

#### D. Total Equity Value

*   **Total Enterprise Value (NPV):** Sum of NPV of Future Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value
    *   Total NPV = \$2,561 million + \$6,122 million = **\$8,683 million**
*   **Total Equity Value:** Total NPV + Cash - Total Debt
    *   Total Equity Value = \$8,683 million + \$400 million - \$3,210 million
    *   Total Equity Value = **\$5,873 million**

### IV. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

#### A. Fair Value Per Share Calculation

Fair Value Per Share = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share = \$5,873 million / 94.00 million shares
**Fair Value Per Share = \$62.48**

#### B. Market Value Comparison and Justification

*   **Calculated Fair Value:** **\$62.48**
*   **Current Market Price (Approximate):** **\$74.00**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$62.48** is approximately **15.5% lower** than the current market price of $\approx \$74.00$.

#### C. Justification for Deviation (Market Assumptions)

The market value is higher than the conservative DCF valuation, suggesting the market is making more optimistic assumptions about Voya's future performance. The deviation is justified by the following conservative assumptions in the model:

1.  **Lower-than-Expected Revenue Growth:** The model's conservative revenue growth rate (4.0% in 2026, tapering to 2.5% by 2028) is likely lower than market expectations. Given the momentum in **Investment Management** (4.8% organic growth in 2025) and the significant asset infusion from OneAmerica, the market likely expects a sustained, higher organic growth rate (e.g., 5-6%) in the fee-based segments, driven by both market appreciation and strong net flows.
2.  **Conservative Margin/ROIC:** The model assumes a very conservative **7.0% Net Income Margin** (below 2025 actual 7.48%) and a low **5.0% ROIC** on retained cash. Management explicitly guides to improved margins in Health Solutions and a high Adjusted ROE (18.6%). The market likely prices in a faster and more successful margin expansion across the business, leading to a higher Net Income Margin and/or a higher ROIC on retained capital.
3.  **Low Terminal Growth Rate:** The model uses a very conservative perpetual growth rate of **1.5%**. The market is likely discounting cash flows at a higher perpetual rate (e.g., 2.5%-3.0%), reflecting the long-term structural growth in the retirement and asset management industries.

**Conclusion:** The conservative DCF model indicates a fair value below the current market price. The market appears to be assuming a higher long-term growth rate and/or greater success in achieving management's targets for margin expansion and capital efficiency than incorporated in this conservative valuation.
