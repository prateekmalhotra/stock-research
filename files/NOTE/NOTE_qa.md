## Business Summary

FiscalNote operates using a recurring subscription model, primarily selling software and data services (SaaS) to professional clients globally. Its core service is gathering, tracking, and analyzing massive amounts of legislative, regulatory, and geopolitical information—essentially translating complex policy changes into actionable data. Customers, which are mainly large corporations, law firms, government relations professionals, and advocacy groups, pay annual fees to access these platforms to understand how new laws or rules might affect their operations. This ensures predictable revenue streams, as clients rely on this constant flow of specialized information to maintain compliance and strategize their responses to policy shifts.

## Business Model Risk

The business faces risks primarily related to its rapid growth strategy, which heavily relies on buying smaller companies (acquisitions). Near-term concerns involve integration risk; if FiscalNote cannot successfully combine the technology, data sets, and employee teams of these disparate businesses, it could lead to increased operational costs and customer confusion, potentially hindering profitability. A second major risk is dependence on maintaining extremely high data quality and comprehensive coverage, as clients pay a premium for accuracy; any failure to track critical legislative changes could cause subscribers to switch providers. Long-term risks include potential budget cuts by corporate or government clients during economic slowdowns, reducing their willingness to renew specialized data subscriptions. This susceptibility has always been a concern for premium B2B data services. Furthermore, the increasing capabilities of public domain generative AI tools could eventually automate some of FiscalNote’s basic data analysis services, potentially reducing its competitive edge over the long term.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of FiscalNote Holdings, Inc., explaining its journey from a student-led startup to a publicly traded leader in policy intelligence.

### **The Inception and Founding Vision (2013)**

1.  **The Founders and Initial Problem:** FiscalNote was founded in June 2013 by three friends and former high school classmates: Timothy Hwang, Gerald Yao, and Jonathan Chen.
2.  **The "Why" - A Clear Goal:** The company was created to solve a problem that Founder Timothy Hwang experienced while working in politics: it was incredibly difficult and time-consuming for organizations to track, search, and understand the vast number of legislative and regulatory changes happening across the U.S. government.
3.  **The Vision (Simple Goal):** Their initial vision was to create a more transparent world by using modern technology to bring clarity to the mountain of disorganized and "unstructured" government data.
4.  **The Start:** The founders, all young men fresh out of college or deferring business school, started the company in Sunnyvale, California, working out of a Motel 6 to build their first product.

### **Early Headwinds, Innovative Solutions, and Growth (2013 - 2021)**

5.  **Initial Headwind and a Lifeline:** In the very early days, the company struggled financially, to the point where the small team voluntarily cut or gave up their salaries to stay afloat while waiting for their first funding round to close.
6.  **First Big Tailwinds (Funding):** Their luck changed after Timothy Hwang sent a "cold email" to billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who agreed to lead a \$1.3 million seed round, quickly followed by investments from other big names like Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.
7.  **The Innovative Solution (AI Power):** FiscalNote pioneered the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze proposed government legislation, creating a platform that could track bills, analyze sponsors' voting records, and even provide a list of strengths and weaknesses for proposed laws.
8.  **Strategic Shift and Expansion:** The company moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C., to be closer to its customers (government affairs professionals) and began a period of rapid growth by acquiring smaller companies to expand its data and service offerings.
9.  **A Major Acquisition (Proprietary Data):** In 2018, FiscalNote acquired the venerable publishing company CQ Roll Call, which included the well-respected news organizations *Roll Call* and *Congressional Quarterly* (CQ). This was a key strategic move, as it added premium, proprietary journalism and human intelligence to their technology platform, providing analysis alongside raw data.

### **The Public Market and Present Day (2022 - Present)**

10. **A New Era (Going Public):** FiscalNote became a publicly listed company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "NOTE" on August 1, 2022.
11. **Expanding the Focus (ESG):** Recognizing a global tailwind toward corporate social responsibility, FiscalNote launched its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Solutions suite in 2022, which uses AI to help organizations meet their sustainability and corporate governance goals.
12. **The Current Business Goal:** FiscalNote’s primary goal is to provide a single, comprehensive, and essential subscription-based platform, called PolicyNote, that empowers organizations—including half of the Fortune 100, law firms, and governments—to navigate the increasingly complex and chaotic global political, policy, and regulatory environment.
13. **Recent Headwinds (Operational Challenges):** After going public, the company faced struggles, including a significant drop in its stock value and the need to streamline its business, which is a common challenge for fast-growing companies that need to pivot toward profitability.
14. **The Latest Innovative Solutions (AI Focus):** To counter the struggles, the company doubled down on operational discipline, cutting costs and selling off non-core assets. They focused innovation on their core AI-driven products, adding features like AI-powered bill forecasts (predicting a bill's likelihood of passing) and a Tariff Tracker to help clients manage global trade risks.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NOTE) is built on a combination of proprietary, hard-to-replicate data assets, specialized AI technology, and high customer switching costs derived from its unique position as a single, comprehensive platform.

Here is an analysis of its core competitive advantages:

### 1. Differentiated Market Position and Product Moat

*   **Pioneer in AI-Driven Policy Intelligence:** FiscalNote's original competitive advantage was being a pioneer in applying machine learning and natural language processing (AI) to unstructured government data, a category that was largely unserved by traditional financial data companies.
*   **The "Bloomberg Terminal for Law":** The company is often described as the "Bloomberg terminal for law" or regulatory data, signifying its special position as a centralized, essential platform for real-time, global legislative and regulatory information.
*   **Uniquely Integrated Solution:** The core differentiation is the integration of three elements: **proprietary AI technology**, massive and deep **data coverage**, and **expert human analysis** (from acquired brands like CQ and Roll Call). Competitors often provide one or two of these, but FiscalNote aims to be the single source for policy monitoring, news, and advocacy tools.
*   **Deep Local and Global Coverage:** The company differentiates itself by tracking policy far beyond the federal level, with coverage expanding to over 16,000 local government entities in the U.S. and a growing footprint across 80+ countries. This comprehensive reach is difficult for a new competitor to build quickly.

### 2. Customer and Contract Stickiness (Switching Costs)

*   **Durable Recurring Revenue:** FiscalNote operates on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, serving over 4,000 customers with "durable recurring revenue" and high gross margins. This indicates that its contracts are sticky and long-term, not one-time transactions.
*   **Mission-Critical Data and High Switching Costs:** Its services—which inform customers' compliance, regulatory affairs, and risk management—are often "mission-critical" and deeply integrated into the customers' workflow. Switching from a centralized, customized platform to a new provider is costly and risky for a customer, thus creating a strong financial and operational switching cost.
*   **Blue-Chip Customer Base:** Its customer base, including the White House, all three branches of the U.S. Federal government, and a large portion of the Fortune 500 in heavily regulated industries, demonstrates a critical reliance on its data for high-stakes decision-making.

### 3. Network Effects and Growth Strategy

*   **Data Network Effects:** The company explicitly mentions leveraging "Data Network Effects," where the platform’s value increases as it collects and maps usage and data, allowing its AI to continually refine and synthesize raw information into better, more relevant insights.
*   **Acquisition-Driven Growth Engine:** A primary reason for its growth is its strategic acquisition playbook. FiscalNote acquires small, niche content/data companies (e.g., local legislative data) and immediately cross-sells that new, specialized data to its existing, large global customer base, rapidly multiplying the acquired company's revenue. This flywheel effect has made its platform increasingly comprehensive and hard to replicate.

### 4. Defensibility and Investment

*   **Displacement by Larger Competitors:** The company acknowledges it competes with much larger, well-funded data companies like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. Its defense against capital-rich rivals lies in its **decade-long proprietary AI training data** and the **trusted, expert content brands** it has acquired (like CQ and Roll Call), which offer a blend of tech and editorial analysis that pure-play competitors lack.
*   **Need for Constant Innovation:** FiscalNote must constantly innovate to maintain its edge, as evidenced by its focus on rolling out new AI-powered features like legislative drafting and tariff trackers. However, the company is managing its overall investment; as part of a strategic turnaround, it reported a temporary 29% reduction in R&D expenses while prioritizing AI product launches to drive profitability.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of available public filings, including the 2025 Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), the management incentive and compensation structure for FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NOTE) demonstrates a high degree of alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership is High and Aligned:** Insider ownership is substantial, with reported figures ranging from approximately 36.82% to over 68% of the company's stock held by insiders, which is generally a strong indicator of alignment. The co-founder and Executive Chair, Tim Hwang, along with major individual shareholders/insiders like Manoj Jain, hold significant stakes, meaning their personal wealth is heavily tied to the company's long-term stock performance.

2.  **Compensation Structure is Equity-Focused:** The company's compensation philosophy explicitly emphasizes paying for performance and retention, with compensation for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) heavily weighted toward **long-term equity awards**. For example, the CEO's 2024 total compensation was structured with a minority as base salary, and a significant portion (77.2%) comprised of bonuses, stock, and options, ensuring their financial success is largely dependent on stock value appreciation.

3.  **Performance Metrics are Growth-Oriented:** The Compensation Committee uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as **Run-Rate Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), and Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** to assess executive compensation. These metrics encourage management to focus on the core subscription-based business model's long-term health and growth, which directly benefits shareholders.

4.  **Incentive Conclusion: High Alignment with Shareholders**
    The overall structure suggests that management and directors are **incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders**. The combination of significant insider ownership and a compensation structure where over three-quarters of executive pay is tied to bonuses, stock, and options ensures that executives only line their own pockets if the stock price increases over the long term, thereby benefiting all shareholders.

## Price History

Based on an analysis of its recent price history and technical indicators, here is an analysis of FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NOTE).

### Price History and Technical Analysis Summary

1.  **Current Price and 52-Week Range:** The stock's last reported closing price was **\$4.25** as of October 17, 2025. Its 52-week trading range is extremely wide, with a 52-week low of **\$3.80** and a 52-week high of **\$24.36**.

2.  **Proximity to 52-Week Low:** FiscalNote is currently trading very close to its 52-week low. The stock price of \$4.25 is approximately **11.84%** above its 52-week low of \$3.80.

3.  **Technical Analysis Signals (Trading Low):** Despite being near its 52-week low, most technical analysis indicators suggest the stock is in a **falling trend** and currently has a **"Strong Sell"** or **"Sell"** rating. This technical outlook is largely driven by its price trading below all major moving averages (EMA10, SMA20, SMA50, SMA200), which are generating bearish signals.

4.  **Significant Price Movements: The Big Drop:** The large price difference in the 52-week range and the significant overall year-over-year decline (approximately 69%) are heavily influenced by a major corporate action. In August 2025, the company announced a **1-for-12 reverse stock split** to increase its nominal share price and ensure compliance with the NYSE's minimum listing price requirement.

5.  **Reason for Recent Drops:** The stock has shown significant weakness in the last few months, falling over 17% in the 10 days leading up to October 17, 2025. This decline followed a negative reaction to its **Q2 2025 earnings report** in August 2025, which revealed a **20% year-over-year drop in total revenue**.

6.  **Underlying Financial Concerns:** The revenue decline was mainly attributed to business divestitures and the sunsetting of non-core products, but key subscription metrics like Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) also continued to decline, leading to increased investor caution. While the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and beat adjusted EBITDA expectations, the shrinking revenue base and continued net losses weigh on the stock price.

---

## Long Thesis

FiscalNote is poised to become the definitive, highly profitable subscription service for global policy and regulatory intelligence. In the near term, the bull case rests on the management successfully executing its pivot toward financial discipline. The company has already achieved operational profits and is focused on cutting non-core businesses and costs. This stabilization effort is crucial for building a strong foundation. Long term, FiscalNote's competitive strength comes from its unique combination of proprietary, expert-written news (like CQ Roll Call) and specialized Artificial Intelligence (AI). This blend creates a mission-critical platform for thousands of organizations—including governments and major corporations—who must know how new laws affect them. Because this data is essential for managing risk and compliance, customers rarely switch providers. As the global regulatory environment becomes more complex, FiscalNote will leverage its deep AI integration to drive higher user engagement, leading to a projected return to overall revenue growth by 2026, making the platform indispensable and highly profitable.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The core assumption is that FiscalNote successfully reverses its current decline in subscription revenue (Annual Recurring Revenue) by the second half of 2025, as projected by management. It is also assumed that the new CEO and streamlined strategy successfully integrate all previously acquired companies and deliver sustained, significant cost savings without harming the quality or comprehensiveness of the data. Finally, the company's proprietary policy data and specialized AI features must remain superior to general-purpose generative AI tools, ensuring that clients continue to pay a premium for FiscalNote's specific, essential policy analysis.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the following holes and faults in the FiscalNote Holdings (NOTE) long thesis:

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

1.  **Core Assumption of Revenue Turnaround is Unproven (ARR Decline):** The thesis's near-term foundation rests on the "successful reversal of its current decline in subscription revenue (ARR)" by the second half of 2025, yet core metrics continue to decline. In Q2 2025, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), when adjusted to exclude divested businesses (pro forma), still declined by 8% year-over-year, and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) fell to 96% from 98%. This indicates that existing customers are either churning or downsizing their contracts in the core business, directly challenging the management's optimistic timeline for a return to growth.
2.  **"Highly Profitable" is a Non-GAAP Measure (The Profitability Illusion):** While the company has achieved its goal of generating positive **Adjusted EBITDA** for multiple consecutive quarters and a full year in 2024, the full GAAP financial results show ongoing financial pressure. The company reported an expanding net loss of \$13.27 million in Q2 2025, signaling that non-operating expenses, such as high interest on debt or stock-based compensation, continue to significantly offset operating gains.
3.  **High Execution Risk in Streamlining and Integration:** The management's strategy of divesting numerous acquired "non-core" assets (e.g., Oxford Analytica, Dragonfly, Timebase) to simplify the business is crucial but carries substantial integration risk. Aggressive divestitures cause reported revenue to decline significantly, and the forced migration of legacy customers to the new PolicyNote platform risks further near-term customer churn due to product disruption or dissatisfaction.
4.  **Competitive Threat from Large Data & AI Competitors:** The assumption that FiscalNote's specialized AI remains "superior to general-purpose generative AI tools" and merits a premium is a major risk factor. Much larger, well-funded competitors like Thomson Reuters or Bloomberg, which already possess vast proprietary data networks and greater capital, could rapidly deploy or integrate their own high-quality, specialized AI tools, potentially commoditizing FiscalNote's core offerings.
5.  **Leverage and Liquidity Concerns Remain:** The reliance on divestiture proceeds to pay down debt is a non-recurring event, and the stock is trading significantly below its IPO price, suggesting poor investor confidence in the long-term, self-funded growth plan. While debt has been reduced, continued GAAP losses and an inability to convert positive Adjusted EBITDA into positive Free Cash Flow quickly could renew liquidity concerns if the H2 2025 ARR rebound fails to materialize.

---

### **Bear Case Thesis for FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NOTE)**

1.  **The Operational Turnaround is a Financial Illusion:** FiscalNote's reported **Adjusted EBITDA profitability** is an exercise in cost-cutting and asset sales, not sustainable, organic revenue growth. The ongoing decline in *pro forma* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) confirms a fundamental and sustained inability to grow the core subscriber base, which is the long-term value driver for a SaaS company.
2.  **AI is a Feature, Not an Indefensible Moat:** The company's specialized AI (PolicyNote, Copilot) is a necessary product upgrade, but the technological barrier is not high enough to warrant a premium indefinitely. Policy data is ultimately public information (with proprietary indexing and analysis), and a larger, resource-rich competitor could quickly integrate a comparable or superior AI layer into their own existing, deeper customer bases, putting immediate downward pressure on FiscalNote's pricing.
3.  **Revenue Contraction is Structural:** The divestitures, while improving the balance sheet, have permanently shrunk the revenue base, and the sustained drop in NRR suggests that the "mission-critical" nature of the product is eroding among current clients. This trend will make the path to returning to overall revenue growth by 2026 much steeper, forcing the company to achieve a disproportionately high rate of new customer acquisition just to offset existing customer churn and downsells.
4.  **Long-Term GAAP Profitability Remains Distant:** Despite positive Adjusted EBITDA, the company continues to report significant GAAP net losses, demonstrating that the full cost structure (including amortization and interest) remains too heavy for the current revenue scale. This suggests that shareholders will face prolonged dilution or financing risk before the company can be truly self-sustaining and "highly profitable" on a reported earnings basis.

---

## Next Steps

The initial analysis is comprehensive, but the bear thesis correctly highlights that the critical path to success hinges on converting Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) into true GAAP profitability and, most importantly, positive Free Cash Flow (FCF). The initial search has successfully filled in some key financial gaps, which now allows for more focused and pointed questions.

Here is an analysis of what you should investigate next:

### **1. Deep Dive into Financial Solvency and Cash Flow**

*   **Determine the True Cost of Debt:** You have confirmed the company received a total consideration of **\$40 million** for the divestiture of Oxford Analytica and Dragonfly, with **\$27.1 million** in net proceeds used to reduce senior term debt to approximately **\$61.5 million** (as of Q1 2025). Now, the question is: what is the *annual interest expense* on this remaining **\$61.5 million** debt?
*   **Analyze the FCF Burn Rate:** The company is aiming for positive Free Cash Flow (FCF) and reported a quarterly FCF of **-\$7.7 million** for Q2 2025. You need to investigate the primary *components* of this burn (e.g., cash interest, restructuring costs, CapEx) to project when they can genuinely turn FCF positive and eliminate the risk of requiring another capital raise.
*   **Calculate Share Dilution:** The management incentive plan is heavily equity-based. Investigate the current, fully diluted share count (post-reverse split) and the number of shares reserved for future equity compensation. This is crucial for calculating the true *net loss per share* and the potential for future shareholder dilution.

### **2. Validate the Core Subscription Turnaround (ARR/NRR)**

*   **Scrutinize ARR/NRR Projections:** Management projects Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth to resume in the second half of 2025. Track the Q3 2025 earnings report (scheduled for November 11, 2025) to find the *actual reported* ARR and Net Revenue Retention (NRR) to validate if the downward trend (NRR at 96% and 8% pro forma ARR decline in Q2 2025) has stabilized as promised.
*   **Investigate PolicyNote Adoption:** Search for independent or third-party reports/reviews on the new **PolicyNote** platform and the "AI Co-pilot" features. The bull case relies on this driving stickiness; you need to find evidence beyond management's commentary on "enhanced user engagement."
*   **Quantify Revenue from Divested Assets:** Determine the exact *Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)* that Oxford Analytica, Dragonfly, and Timebase contributed to the total revenue in the last 12 months. This allows you to differentiate between the revenue decline from intentional divestiture versus the decline from the *core, retained* business losing customers.

### **3. Competitive Landscape and Moat Durability**

*   **Identify Direct Competitor Pricing:** The moat analysis generally mentions large firms like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. Investigate specialized competitors (e.g., in state-level legislative tracking, specific regulatory compliance software, or advocacy tools) to understand their pricing structure and service models.
*   **Assess AI Commoditization Risk:** Research the recent AI offerings from major competitors (BloombergGPT, Thomson Reuters Generative AI tools). The bear case suggests AI could commoditize FiscalNote's analysis; you need to see if a larger competitor is rapidly closing the specialized "policy intelligence" gap.
