## Business Summary

Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH) primarily generates revenue by constructing and selling single-family homes. The vast majority of its income comes directly from these home sales, with supplementary revenue derived from offering in-house mortgage and title services to buyers, which streamlines the purchasing process. DFH focuses its operations in rapidly growing, high-demand metropolitan areas across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, including Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas. Their core customers are typically entry-level buyers purchasing their first home or 'move-up' buyers seeking a slightly larger or better-located house. The business model centers on acquiring raw land, developing it into communities, and then building affordable and semi-custom homes, often starting construction before a buyer has fully committed (speculative building) to manage construction timelines and inventories efficiently.

## Business Model Risk

DFH faces substantial near-term and long-term risks due to the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry. The most immediate threat is the vulnerability to interest rate hikes and broader economic health. Historically, when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation, mortgage affordability rapidly declines. This severely limits the pool of potential buyers, forcing builders like DFH to either slow sales or cut prices, directly harming profit margins. This phenomenon was a key factor in previous housing downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis. Currently, high mortgage rates are a major concern, potentially leading to increased inventory of unsold homes. A near-term operational risk involves unpredictable construction costs. DFH relies heavily on subcontractors and materials (lumber, concrete, etc.). If DFH has set a selling price for a home, but the costs of materials or labor rise unexpectedly before completion, their committed profit margin shrinks. Long-term risk is concentrated in land acquisition. DFH must constantly acquire land to ensure future construction opportunities. If they overpay for land during a market boom, or if the local housing market suddenly cools, they may be stuck with expensive inventory that is no longer profitable to build on, endangering long-term earnings and market position.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH), starting from its founding to its present operations.

### The Inception: Starting in a Crisis (2008–2010)

1.  **A Business Born from Opportunity:** Dream Finders Homes was founded in 2008 by Patrick Zalupski in Jacksonville, Florida, right at the height of the Great Recession and housing market collapse.
2.  **The Founding Vision:** Zalupski, who had a background in finance and experience renovating homes, saw a unique chance to get into homebuilding when national builders were retreating and land prices were extremely low.
3.  **The Founding Goal:** The company's initial mission was to build high-quality, affordable homes primarily for first-time homebuyers, leveraging the low cost of land available in the depressed market.

### Innovative Solution and Early Success (2008–2012)

4.  **Problem: Lack of Capital:** As a small, new company starting during a credit crunch, DFH did not have large amounts of capital to buy and hold land like the major national builders.
5.  **Innovative Solution: The "Asset-Light" Model:** DFH adopted a brilliant strategy: instead of buying land outright, they secured it through **option contracts** with developers. This meant they only paid for the lots right before they were ready to start building or once the homes were sold.
6.  **The Result of the Solution:** This minimized financial risk and required significantly less upfront money, allowing the company to grow quickly and efficiently, essentially "building homes with someone else's capital" in the beginning.
7.  **First Year Milestone:** This model allowed DFH to build 27 homes in its first full year of operation in 2009, a small start that laid the foundation for future growth.

### Expansion and Geographic Growth (2013–2020)

8.  **The First Tailwinds (Economic Recovery):** As the housing market began to recover, the land they had secured at low, crisis-era prices became much more valuable, fueling rapid expansion.
9.  **Organic Expansion:** From its Jacksonville base, the company began to move into new, high-growth metropolitan areas, starting with Orlando and later expanding into markets like Austin, Denver, and the Washington D.C. area.
10. **A New Growth Strategy: Acquisitions (M&A Spree):** To accelerate its growth and enter new markets quickly, DFH began strategically acquiring established local homebuilding companies.
11. **Acquisition Benefits:** This strategy allowed DFH to bypass the slow process of starting a new division from scratch, instantly gaining experienced local teams, established vendor relationships, and a pipeline of land for development.
12. **Major Acquisitions:** Key acquisitions included Village Park Homes (2018), H&H Homes (2019), and McGuyer Homebuilders (2020), which solidified its presence across the Southeast and Texas.
13. **Financial Tailwind:** In 2017, the company received a strategic investment from Boston Omaha Corporation, providing substantial capital to help fund this aggressive expansion.

### Present Day and Public Company Status (2021–Present)

14. **Pivotal Moment: Going Public:** In January 2021, Dream Finders Homes completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO), becoming a publicly traded company and providing a massive influx of capital for continued expansion.
15. **Headwind: Supply Chain and Affordability Challenges:** Like all builders, the company has faced recent industry headwinds, including global supply chain disruptions for materials and rising interest rates that affect housing affordability for buyers.
16. **How They Deal with Headwinds:** DFH has addressed this by focusing on efficient operations, leveraging its scale for better supplier relationships, and using sales incentives to help buyers manage the challenging mortgage rate environment.
17. **Integrated Financial Services:** The company now offers an integrated service through its affiliated businesses, DF Mortgage and DF Title, giving homebuyers a simplified, one-stop-shop for financing and closing their new home.
18. **Current Focus and Goal:** The company's goal remains focused on its core market of first-time and first-time move-up homebuyers, consistently delivering homes in rapidly growing regions across the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southwest, and continues its acquisition strategy to enter new markets like Nashville and Atlanta.

## Moat Analysis

The competitive advantage, or "moat," of Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH) is primarily centered on its distinct approach to land acquisition, which provides superior financial flexibility and risk management compared to most large, traditional homebuilders.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat and differentiation:

### **The Core Moat: Asset-Light Business Model**

1.  **Structural Capital Efficiency:** DFH uses an **asset-light** land model, similar to NVR, Inc., where it secures land through lot option contracts and deposits rather than buying and holding the land outright on its balance sheet.
2.  **Minimized Risk and High Returns:** This model drastically reduces the financial risk associated with a decline in land value during a housing market downturn. By committing less capital to land, the company achieves much higher Return on Equity (ROE) and better inventory turnover compared to its asset-heavy competitors.
3.  **The Reason for Growth:** The company's rapid growth (high Compound Annual Growth Rate) is a direct consequence of this model's scalability; controlling a large number of lots (a "controlled lot pipeline") with minimal capital expenditure allows for quick expansion into new markets and a high volume of home sales.

### **Pricing Power and Market Position**

4.  **Defensive Pricing Power:** While the company does not have a unique product that commands a massive price premium, the asset-light model provides crucial **defensive pricing power**. By not holding excess land inventory, DFH is less desperate to cut home prices during slow markets to free up capital, which helps protect its profit margins.
5.  **Strategic Market Focus:** DFH targets high-growth, desirable markets in the Sun Belt (like Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas) that show strong population growth and in-migration trends, which inherently drives demand and supports pricing.
6.  **Product Differentiation:** The company positions itself strategically, focusing on the **entry-level to move-up buyer** with a blend of affordability, quality, and a higher degree of customization than many large production homebuilders.

### **Customer Stickiness and Contract Nature**

7.  **One-Time Sales with Financial Stickiness:** Home construction is fundamentally a one-time purchase, not a recurring subscription. The customer contract itself is sticky because it is secured by a typically **nonrefundable deposit**, which often averages around 9% of the home's purchase price.
8.  **Vertical Integration/Embedded Service:** The company creates stickiness through its **Financial Services segment** (mortgage financing and title insurance). By offering these services in-house, DFH simplifies the complicated home-buying process for the customer and captures additional revenue streams, effectively integrating the whole transaction.
9.  **Reputational Risk/Lack of Moat:** A potential weakness in brand loyalty is suggested by public customer complaints regarding build quality and customer service, which can damage the long-term reputation and reduce repeat/referral business, indicating that brand is not a strong component of the moat.

### **Displacement and Innovation**

10. **Displacement by Capital is Difficult:** A well-capitalized competitor could only displace DFH by successfully replicating the **asset-light model** itself, not just by outspending them on traditional land ownership. The core advantage is *not* having capital tied up in land inventory, which a competitor with "more capital" would have to intentionally avoid to compete on an equal footing of capital efficiency.
11. **Network Effects (Limited):** The business does not rely on classic customer-to-customer network effects (like a social media company). However, the scale and focus of the asset-light model likely create favorable **developer/land banker relationships** over time, which can become a hard-to-replicate advantage in securing future option contracts.
12. **Minimal R&D Investment:** Dream Finders Homes, like most homebuilders, reports virtually **zero R&D expenses** in its financial statements. Their innovation is focused on construction process efficiency, design, and incorporating sustainable practices, rather than costly, high-tech R&D to maintain an edge.

## Management Record

The management of Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH) is centrally characterized by its founder-led structure, aggressive growth strategy, and unique capital-efficient business model.

### **CEO, History, and Track Record**

1.  **Founder-Led Management:** Patrick Zalupski is the Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, having started the company in 2008. He remains heavily involved in overall operations, origination, underwriting, and structuring of all investment activities.
2.  **Origin and Grit:** Zalupski founded DFH during the Great Recession in 2008 with a focus on single-family detached homes, learning from a prior real estate failure. The company began by closing only 27 homes in 2009.
3.  **High Insider Control:** Zalupski holds a substantial position, owning roughly 65% of the economic interest and controlling approximately 85% of the votes due to the Class B shares having three times the voting power of Class A shares. This structure suggests strong management alignment with the company’s long-term vision but concentrates control.
4.  **Track Record of Rapid Growth:** Under his leadership, DFH has grown from a local builder to the 14th largest public homebuilder, closing 8,583 homes in 2024, compared to an initial goal of 1,000 homes per year, which was first surpassed in 2018. The company was named **2025's Builder of the Year** by Builder Magazine.
5.  **Key Supporting Management:** Key executives include CFO Anabel Fernandez, a Certified Public Accountant appointed in 2022 (after serving as Interim CFO since 2021), and COO Doug Moran, who has been with the primary subsidiary since 2017.

### **Strategy, Vision, and Key Decisions**

6.  **Asset-Light Strategy (Key Decision):** DFH utilizes an "asset-light lot acquisition model," primarily controlling land through option contracts rather than direct ownership. This strategic decision is fundamental to reducing financial risk, enhancing asset turnover, and improving the return on equity.
7.  **Focus on Affordable Housing and High-Growth Markets:** The company's vision and strategy concentrate on entry-level and first-time move-up homes, operating in high-growth markets where population and employment are increasing above the national average.
8.  **Strategic M&A for Expansion (Key Decision):** Management has used strategic acquisitions, such as Liberty Communities in 2024 (expanding into Atlanta) and Crescent Homes (expanding into Charleston, Greenville, and Nashville), to accelerate growth and enter new, large markets.
9.  **Vertical Integration and Financial Services:** DFH has an integrated business model that includes a financial services segment with a mortgage banking joint venture (Jet HomeLoans) and a title services company, enhancing the homebuying experience and service offering.

### **Shareholder Value and Performance Delivery**

10. **Value Creation Promise:** Management asserts that they have compounded shareholder equity, earnings, and revenue by more than 40% annually since the company's 2008 inception and consistently grow intrinsic value for shareholders.
11. **High Return on Equity (ROE):** The company reported an impressive return on participating equity of 49.1% in 2022 and 36.3% in 2023, which they credit to the efficiency of the asset-light model.
12. **Resilience During Market Turmoil:** DFH demonstrated resilience during the 2020–2023 housing market correction, achieving significant revenue growth (e.g., 74% year-over-year in 2022) when new home sales nationally declined.
13. **Delivery on Guidance:** The company closed 7,314 homes in 2023, outperforming its conservative guidance of 6,000 closings set amidst interest rate hikes.
14. **Investor Caution on Margins:** Some analysts express concern that the high "adjusted margins" touted by management become significantly lower when commissions paid and interest expense—which they argue are real costs—are not adjusted out.
15. **Debt and Risk Profile:** Despite its asset-light model, DFH's corporate-level debt leverage is noted as being far greater than that of some of its peers, which may be a risk factor in the cyclical homebuilding business.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Dream Finders Homes, Inc.'s (DFH) corporate filings, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Insider Ownership (High Control):** Dream Finders Homes operates with a dual-class stock structure, consisting of Class A Common Stock (one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (three votes per share). This structure grants significant voting control to the insiders who hold the Class B shares, which, as of February 2025, totaled over 57.7 million shares compared to 35.7 million Class A shares.

2.  **High Insider Control (Higher is Better for Long-Term Alignment):** The founder, CEO, and Chairman, Patrick O. Zalupski, is highly likely to possess the majority of the high-vote stock. This concentration of voting power suggests that management's wealth is overwhelmingly tied to the long-term success of the company, which is a strong incentive to act in the company's best interest (and, by extension, shareholder interest).

3.  **Compensation Structure is Performance-Based:** The executive compensation program is linked to specific financial and operational metrics, which aligns pay with company performance. The key metrics include: **Adjusted Pre-Tax Income, Home Closings, Return on Participating Equity (ROE),** and **Net Debt to Capitalization Ratio**.

4.  **Alignment with Shareholder Value:** The inclusion of Return on Participating Equity (ROE) and the Net Debt to Capitalization Ratio in the compensation plan is highly favorable for shareholders. These metrics directly incentivize management to use capital efficiently and to manage financial risk, which are critical drivers of long-term value in the homebuilding industry.

5.  **High Compensation Level:** The CEO's total compensation, reported at approximately \$12.88 million for 2024, is considered above average for companies of a similar size in the U.S. market. This figure suggests a significant portion of their pay comes from equity and bonuses, reinforcing the performance-based nature of the structure.

### **Conclusion: Incentive to Act in Shareholders' Interest**

*   **Yes, there is a strong incentive to act in the interest of shareholders.** The founder's high ownership and voting control (via the Class B stock) create an existential link between his personal wealth and the company's long-term stock performance.
*   **The compensation structure directly supports this alignment** by tying a large portion of pay to value-creation metrics like **Return on Equity** and **risk-management** metrics like the **Net Debt to Capitalization Ratio**.
*   **However, the dual-class structure and high compensation create limited accountability.** While the pay is performance-driven, the dual-class shares concentrate voting power with the founder, meaning external shareholders have little practical recourse to challenge the level of compensation, even if they disagree, as the advisory vote on compensation is non-binding. The management is incentivized to create value, but they have the power to approve their own compensation regardless of a majority *non-binding* shareholder vote.

## Price History

Based on the analysis of Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH) price history and current technical indicators (as of late September 2025 data):

1.  **Price Range and Current Position:** The stock has traded within a wide **52-week range of \$19.65 to approximately \$36.10**. With a recent closing price around \$25.92, it is trading significantly above its low but also substantially below its high.

2.  **Percentage Above 52-Week Low:** Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH) is currently trading approximately **31.91%** above its 52-week low of \$19.65.
    *   *Calculation: ((\\$25.92 - \\$19.65) / \\$19.65) \* 100 \approx 31.91\%*.

3.  **Technical Analysis Sentiment ("Trading Low"):** The stock is not technically considered "oversold" (or "trading low") based on its Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 44.977. An RSI below 30 would typically indicate a short-term oversold condition.

4.  **Technical Sell Signals:** Key technical indicators generally suggest bearish momentum, with a consensus for a **"Strong Sell"** based on daily analysis, which includes zero buy signals and multiple sell signals. Additionally, the stock's price is below its 50-day moving average of \$26.73, which is another common sell signal for traders.

5.  **Recent Significant Price Drop Explanation:** The stock has experienced a noticeable drop recently, losing **5.54% over the last month**. This downward pressure is strongly correlated with a poor near-term fundamental outlook.

6.  **Earnings Estimate Revisions:** Over the last 30 days, analyst consensus for Earnings Per Share (EPS) has been revised **30.73% lower**, moving the stock to a Zacks Rank of "Strong Sell". The forecast for the upcoming quarterly EPS suggests a **32.86% decline** compared to the same quarter last year, which serves as a major fundamental reason for the recent decline in share price.

7.  **Sector Performance:** The decline in DFH's price has occurred while the broader S\&P 500 index has generally moved higher, indicating that the stock's weakness is likely company or sector-specific.

## Long Thesis

Dream Finders Homes is poised for significant long-term growth driven by its unique, capital-efficient business model. Unlike traditional homebuilders that tie up massive amounts of cash buying land outright, DFH primarily uses options to control its land supply. This ‘asset-light’ approach drastically reduces financial risk during market downturns, minimizes the amount of capital needed to operate, and allows the company to generate much higher returns on invested money (profitability). In the near term, DFH is successfully executing its strategy of rapid expansion by acquiring smaller local builders and focusing exclusively on high-growth areas in the Sun Belt (like Florida and Texas). Management has already secured a huge inventory of future home sites (over 63,000 lots) under option contracts, giving them a guaranteed path for consistent revenue and home closings, supporting aggressive expansion regardless of temporary economic fluctuations. The addition of in-house mortgage and title services also boosts overall profit margins.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

This bull case relies on several critical assumptions: 1) The unique asset-light model continues to be viable, meaning the company must consistently secure favorable lot option contracts with land developers. 2) DFH successfully integrates its new acquisitions without significant operational delays or cost overruns. 3) Demand for entry-level and move-up homes in the targeted Sun Belt markets remains robust, supported by continued population and job growth in those regions. 4) While DFH is resilient, mortgage interest rates must stabilize or decline enough over the long term to maintain housing affordability for its core customer base, preventing a major market crash.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies the holes and faults in the long thesis for Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH).

## Bear Case Thesis and Flaws in the Bull Case

The long thesis overstates the insulation provided by the "asset-light" model and minimizes the significant financial and macroeconomic pressures currently impacting the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy.

### Flaws in the "Asset-Light" Model & Risk Management

1.  **High Cost of Option Contracts:** The capital-efficient model trades off lower upfront investment for higher ongoing costs. The large inventory of over 63,000 optioned lots, while de-risking the balance sheet, requires the company to consistently pay lot option fees. This strategy introduces risk because if the housing market slows down, DFH must choose between either forfeiting significant option deposits or incurring additional costs through contract extensions and fees, which can erode profitability.
2.  **Loss of Land Development Control:** An asset-light model relies heavily on land developers and third parties to deliver finished lots on schedule. This lack of "sovereignty" over the land development process means DFH has less control over supply chain timing, material costs, and land-use decisions, potentially leading to delays and missed closing targets if a developer faces issues.
3.  **Gross Margin Pressure from External Costs:** The bull case touts high returns on invested capital, but recent financial performance indicates pressure on the core business. Homebuilding gross margins have been decreasing, primarily due to increased incentives for buyers and higher land and financing costs, suggesting that even the cost structure of the asset-light model is not fully insulated from inflation and market headwinds.

### Flaws in the Expansion and Acquisition Strategy

4.  **Significant Increase in Operating Costs from Acquisitions:** The assumption of successful integration "without significant operational delays or cost overruns" is directly challenged by recent financial results. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG\&A) expenses have seen a sharp increase (39% year-over-year in Q2 2025) with SG\&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue rising significantly, which management explicitly attributes to costs from recent acquisitions and organic expansion.
5.  **Unsustainable Growth-at-Any-Cost Mindset:** The strategy of rapid expansion through continuous acquisitions increases execution risk. The company must successfully merge disparate operations, cultures, and supply chains, which historically leads to integration challenges and the risk of overpaying for assets just to maintain a high growth rate.
6.  **Declining Backlog:** Despite the aggressive expansion and large lot inventory, the total value and number of homes in the backlog (homes sold but not yet closed) has been decreasing, indicating a potential deceleration in future guaranteed revenue, which counters the narrative of a guaranteed path for "consistent revenue."

### Flaws in Macroeconomic and Market Assumptions

7.  **Affordability Crisis Necessitates Incentives:** The assumption of "robust demand" is questionable in an environment of "persistently high mortgage rates," which analysts describe as a "worst-case scenario for housing affordability." DFH has had to increase sales incentives to boost net new orders and maintain sales pace, a common homebuilder strategy that directly compresses profit margins.
8.  **Geographic Concentration Risk:** A nearly exclusive focus on the Sun Belt magnifies exposure to a single economic and migratory trend. If the recent post-pandemic migration pattern to the Sun Belt slows or reverses, or if local economies in major markets like Florida and Texas cool, the company's growth pipeline will be disproportionately impacted.
9.  **Valuation Skepticism:** The market's current valuation of DFH, which includes a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to peers, reflects skepticism about management's ability to maintain high growth and profitability. This "valuation dislocation" suggests investors are already pricing in the risk of margin pressure and integration failures, regardless of the strong historical growth figures.

## Next Steps

This is an excellent, detailed analysis. You have effectively captured the core bull and bear arguments, identified the company's unique moat, and highlighted the key risks.

The search results from the initial investigation provide crucial, concrete data points that now allow you to refine your next steps. Specifically, you have:
*   **Valuation Data (Mixed):** A recent trailing P/E of **8.50x** to **8.71x** and a P/B of **1.83x** to **2.03x**. It's noted to be lower than NVR's P/E of 17.93x and P/B of 6.39x in a November 2024 comparison, suggesting it's potentially undervalued relative to the premier asset-light peer.
*   **Analyst Sentiment (Mixed/Hold):** The consensus rating has moved from a prior "Strong Sell" to a current **"Hold"**. The average price target is around **\$28.00** (with a range of \$25.00 to \$30.00), suggesting a moderate upside from a current price around \$26.28 to \$26.79.
*   **Margin & Debt Metrics (Concrete Data):**
    *   **Net Debt to Net Capitalization** was **39.9%** as of Q1 2024, an improvement from the prior year.
    *   **GAAP Gross Margin** was **19.0%** in Q2 2024, consistent with the prior year, while **Adjusted Gross Margin** was **27.0%**. The difference is partly due to **purchase accounting amortization** from the Crescent Homes acquisition.
    *   **ROE** was reported as **22.94%**.

Based on these findings, here are the most important remaining questions and next steps to investigate, focusing on the quality of the moat, the true financial cost of the strategy, and the valuation gap.

### Next Steps to Investigate

#### 1. Quantify the Cost and Risk of the "Asset-Light" Moat

*   **Option Fees and Forfeitures:** Search for the specific dollar amount of **lot option fees** and any reported **forfeited deposits** in the last 10-K or 10-Q reports. This is a direct cost of the asset-light model that must be quantified to validate the bear case that the fees erode profitability.
*   **The Land-Banker Relationship Advantage:** Investigate the relationship between DFH and its developers/land-bankers. Search for details on their largest land providers, contractual lock-in periods, and whether the company is facing an increased cost or tighter terms for securing new option contracts.

#### 2. Deep Dive into Profitability and True Valuation

*   **Deconstruct the Margin Adjustment:** Specifically, investigate the components of the "Adjusted Gross Margin" and the rationale for management using it. Find the detailed reconciliation that explains the difference between the **19.0% GAAP Gross Margin** and the **27.0% Adjusted Gross Margin** (the \$8.0\% difference). This will clarify the impact of the acquisition-related **purchase accounting amortization** and determine how sustainable the "adjusted" figure is.
*   **Valuation vs. Asset-Heavy Peers:** While you compared DFH to NVR, now compare its **P/E (8.50x)** and **P/B (1.83x)** to key asset-heavy builders like **PulteGroup (PHM)** and **Lennar (LEN)** to see if the discount is warranted, or if it is merely a smaller cap discount.
*   **SG&A Trend:** Find the recent **SG&A as a percentage of revenue** for the last 4-6 quarters. The bear case cites a sharp increase; quantifying this will confirm if the M&A-driven growth is becoming structurally more expensive to manage.

#### 3. Execution Risk and Market Deceleration

*   **Acquisition Integration Status:** Find management commentary or news on the specific **Crescent Homes** integration beyond the purchase accounting amortization. Has the full synergy potential been realized, or are there ongoing operational delays that contribute to the elevated SG&A?
*   **Reason for EPS Revision:** Investigate the specific cause or news event that led to the reported **30.73% downward revision** in analyst EPS consensus over the last 30 days. This is a major fundamental event that must be understood to justify the current stock price action.
*   **Geographic Concentration Risk Check:** Research if the Sun Belt's housing market (Florida/Texas) is showing any localized signs of weakness (e.g., rising insurance costs, slowing migration, property tax issues) that would disproportionately impact DFH versus a more nationally diversified builder.
