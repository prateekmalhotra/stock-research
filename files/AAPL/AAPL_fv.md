# Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Valuation: Conservative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

This valuation uses a conservative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based *only* on the company's SEC filings and management commentary from the last four earnings call transcripts, as required.

The core principle of this valuation is **conservatism**. Future growth is deliberately modeled below the historical trend, and the discount rate is kept high.

## 1. Initial Financial Data & Cash Calculation

All figures are in millions of U.S. Dollars, except where noted. Financial data is based on the Fiscal Year (FY) ended September 28, 2024 (10-K) and subsequent earnings call commentary.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Justification/Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Marketable Securities (Net Cash Basis)** | **\$157,000** | The company ended Q4 2024 (October 2024 call) with \$157 billion in cash and marketable securities, which are highly liquid assets, as required. |
| **Total Debt (Net Debt Basis)** | **\$107,000** | Total debt at the end of Q4 2024, as stated by the CFO during the earnings call. |
| **Net Cash (Initial) / Debt** | **\$50,000** | Net Cash = Cash & Marketable Securities - Total Debt. |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **15,115,823,000** | As of October 18, 2024. |
| **Net Sales / Revenue (FY 2024)** | **\$391,035** | Total Net Sales for the year ended September 28, 2024. |
| **Net Income (GAAP, FY 2024)** | **\$93,736** | GAAP Net Income for the year ended September 28, 2024. |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$270.04** | Current stock price as of the time of the valuation (November 5, 2025). |

## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The revenue model is segmented into the two main categories: **Products** (primarily iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables) and **Services**.

### Business Engine Assumptions

| Segment | FY 2024 Revenue (M) | Business Engine Drivers | Conservative Annual Growth Rate | Justification for Conservative Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Services** | \$96,169 | Driven by the massive and growing active installed base (over 2.2 billion) and the growth of paid subscriptions (over 1 billion). | **10.0%** | Management consistently guides for double-digit growth (FY2024 was $\sim 12.9\%$). A flat **10.0%** is conservative, accounting for market maturation while acknowledging the sticky, high-margin nature and continued geographic expansion. |
| **Products** | \$294,866 | Dependent on the iPhone upgrade cycle, emerging market penetration, and new hardware like Vision Pro and the AI feature cycle (Apple Intelligence). | **3.0%** | The most conservative part of the business. This low rate models for a largely saturated global smartphone/PC market. The **3.0%** growth factors in the offset of the new *Apple Intelligence* (AI) upgrade cycle starting in 2025 and penetration in new, lower-share emerging markets (India, Turkey, etc.), while avoiding any aggressive 'super-cycle' assumptions. |

### Revenue Projection Table

| Fiscal Year | **2024 (Actual)** | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Services Revenue (M)** | \$96,169 | \$105,786 | \$116,365 | \$127,996 | \$140,796 | \$154,876 | \$170,364 |
| **Products Revenue (M)** | \$294,866 | \$303,712 | \$312,823 | \$322,197 | \$331,863 | \$341,819 | \$352,073 |
| **Total Revenue (M)** | **\$391,035** | **\$409,498** | **\$429,188** | **\$450,193** | **\$472,659** | **\$496,695** | **\$522,437** |
| *Total Revenue Growth* | *2.0%* | *4.7%* | *4.8%* | *4.9%* | *5.0%* | *5.1%* | *5.2%* |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projections

### Margin Assumptions

| Metric | FY 2024 Avg. | Projection (2025-2030) | Justification for Conservative Projection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin (%)** | $\sim$46.0% (Calculated: \$180,683M/\$391,035M) | **46.5% steadily increasing to 47.5%** | Management guided 46%-47% for Q1 2025. A modest increase of 20 basis points per year reflects the favorable and high-margin mix-shift toward the Services segment (Services GM $\sim$74%). |
| **Operating Expenses (OpEx) (M)** | $\sim\$56,760$ (Calculated: FY2024 OpEx) | **\$61,600 increasing to \$66,400** | FY2024 run-rate: OpEx was $\sim\$14.2B-\$14.5B$ per quarter in 2024. Q1 2025 guidance is $\sim\$15.4B$ per quarter, or **\$61.6B** annualized. I project OpEx to grow at a conservative $\sim1.5\%$ annually to account for significant R&D investments, including those related to AI and Vision Pro, which management highlights as a key focus. |
| **Tax Rate (%)** | 19.5% (GAAP) | **16.0%** | Management explicitly guided for a tax rate of **around 16%** for the current quarter (Q1 2025). This is used as gospel for the future, per the rule. |
| **ROIC on Cash (%)** | >30% Historical (TTM) | **2.0%** | Historical ROIC is high (e.g., TTM ROIC is $\sim$55.7%). Per the rule to be *very conservative* in the business engine building, a stable **2.0%** is used. This is a highly conservative rate, modeling the return on net cash as ultra-low-risk Treasury-like investments. |

### Net Income Projection & Cash Flow Table

*Note: Cash Flow = Net Income + (ROIC on Prior Year's Accumulated Cash)*

| Fiscal Year | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue (M)** | \$409,498 | \$429,188 | \$450,193 | \$472,659 | \$496,695 | \$522,437 |
| **Gross Margin (%)** | 46.50% | 46.70% | 46.90% | 47.10% | 47.30% | 47.50% |
| **Gross Profit (M)** | \$190,402 | \$199,578 | \$211,131 | \$222,652 | \$234,917 | \$248,153 |
| **OpEx (M)** | \$61,600 | \$62,524 | \$63,462 | \$64,414 | \$65,380 | \$66,361 |
| **Operating Income (M)** | \$128,802 | \$137,054 | \$147,669 | \$158,238 | \$169,537 | \$181,792 |
| **Tax Rate (%)** | 16.0% | 16.0% | 16.0% | 16.0% | 16.0% | 16.0% |
| **Net Income (M)** | **\$108,194** | **\$115,125** | **\$124,042** | **\$132,920** | **\$142,411** | **\$152,705** |
| **Prior Year's Accumulated Cash (M)** | *N/A* | \$108,194 | \$223,319 | \$347,361 | \$480,281 | \$622,692 |
| **ROIC Income (2.0% of Cash) (M)** | *N/A* | \$2,164 | \$4,466 | \$6,947 | \$9,606 | \$12,454 |
| **Total Cash Flow (for DCF) (M)** | **\$108,194** | **\$117,289** | **\$128,508** | **\$139,867** | **\$152,017** | **\$165,159** |

*Note: Prior Year's Accumulated Cash for 2026 = 2025 Net Income; 2027 = 2026 Net Income + 2025 Net Income, etc. (Since net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year). Total Cash Flow for DCF is Net Income for the year + ROIC Income for that year.*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### Conservative Discount Rate (WACC)

The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is an estimate of the company's cost of financing. For a very conservative valuation of a stable, dominant technology company, I will select a WACC higher than the firm's typical cost of capital.

*   **Conservative Discount Rate (WACC): 9.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a high-end, conservative rate for a blue-chip company, incorporating a significant risk premium for all future cash flows.

### Conservative Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)

The terminal growth rate assumes the company grows in perpetuity after the projection period.

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g): 2.0%**
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative long-term growth rate, roughly in line with long-term global GDP growth, reflecting the company's mature, but still innovative, status.

### DCF Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow (M) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$108,194 | 0.9174 | \$99,252 |
| **2026** | \$117,289 | 0.8417 | \$98,720 |
| **2027** | \$128,508 | 0.7722 | \$99,209 |
| **2028** | \$139,867 | 0.7084 | \$99,102 |
| **2029** | \$152,017 | 0.6499 | \$98,796 |
| **2030** | \$165,159 | 0.5963 | \$98,545 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | \$165,159 x (1+0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02) = \$2,410,480 | 0.5963 | \$1,437,847 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | **\$2,033,471** |

---

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

1.  **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**:
    TEV = NPV of Future Cash Flows + Initial Net Cash
    TEV = \$2,033,471 M + \$50,000 M
    **TEV = \$2,083,471 million**

2.  **Equity Value**:
    Equity Value = TEV - Total Debt (Since the initial Net Cash already adjusted for the debt, the Total Debt is already accounted for in the initial Net Cash line).
    **Equity Value = \$2,083,471 million**

3.  **Fair Value per Share**:
    Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
    Fair Value per Share = \$2,083,471,000,000 / 15,115,823,000 shares
    **Fair Value per Share = \$137.83**

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **\$137.83** |
| **Current Stock Price (AAPL)** | **\$270.04** |
| **Difference** | **-49.0%** |

### Justification of the Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$137.83** is significantly lower than the Current Market Price of **\$270.04**. This large discrepancy is a direct result of the mandated, extremely conservative assumptions in the DCF model.

**The Market's Assumptions vs. The Conservative Model's Assumptions:**

| Factor | Conservative DCF Model Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption (for \$270.04) | Why the difference? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Products: **3.0%**; Services: **10.0%** | Products: $\sim$5-7%; Services: $\sim$15-20% | The market is pricing in a much stronger performance from **Apple Intelligence (AI)** and new products like Vision Pro, believing these will drive a larger, multi-year upgrade cycle (a 'super-cycle') across the entire ecosystem, with Services accelerating significantly due to AI-driven engagement. |
| **ROIC on Cash** | **2.0%** (Ultra-low risk) | **Higher, likely 10%+** | The market expects Apple to deploy its massive cash hoard more effectively through profitable acquisitions, higher-returning internal capital expenditures, and/or extremely accretive share repurchases, which would be reflected in a higher ROIC. |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** (High) | **Lower, likely 7.0%-8.0%** | The market views Apple as a less risky, ultra-safe 'bond proxy' with an impenetrable ecosystem, which warrants a lower cost of equity and thus a lower discount rate. A lower WACC significantly increases the NPV. |
| **Terminal Growth** | **2.0%** (Global GDP) | **Higher, likely 3.0%-3.5%** | The market assumes Apple's powerful, sticky Services division justifies a growth rate well above global GDP in perpetuity, reflecting its status as an "forever company" with monopolistic advantages in its ecosystem. |

**In summary, the market is making the fundamental assumptions that my conservative DCF explicitly rejects, as mandated by the rules:**

The market is valuing Apple as a dominant platform company where the transition to an **AI-first product cycle** (Apple Intelligence) acts as a powerful catalyst for significantly higher revenue growth in the **Products** segment and an *accelerating* growth rate in the high-margin **Services** segment for the next decade, combined with a lower risk profile (lower WACC) than assumed in this model. The current stock price of **\$270.04** is justifiable if one assumes a WACC of $\sim 7.5\%$ and Services growth of $\sim 15\%$ indefinitely.
