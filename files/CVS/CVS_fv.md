### II. Business Engine & Financial Assumptions

The valuation relies on the company's stated shift to an integrated health services model, leveraging its three core segments: Health Care Benefits (Aetna), Health Services (Caremark, Specialty, Oak Street, Signify), and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness (Retail).

#### A. Historical Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Calculation (2024)

ROIC is calculated to project the return generated on reinvested Net Income (as per the valuation rules).

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Calculation / Note | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating Income (EBIT Proxy)** | $8,516 | Full-Year 2024 | [cite: 6 (step 3)] |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 25.4% | Based on 2024 10-K disclosures. | [cite: 3 (step 4)] |
| **NOPAT (2024)** | $6,356 | $8,516 \* (1 - 0.254) | - |
| **Total Invested Capital (2024)** | $141,830 | Debt ($66,270) + Total Equity ($75,560) as of Dec 31, 2024 | |
| **Historical ROIC** | **4.48%** | $6,356 / $141,830 | - |

**Assumed ROIC for Cash Generation:** A conservative figure based on the 2024 result is used: **4.5%**.

#### B. Revenue Growth Rationale (2025-2030)

| Year | Revenue (USD Millions) | Revenue Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $391,500 | 5.0% (vs 2024 Revenue of $372.8B) | Management's Revised Full-Year Guidance: at least $391.5 billion, reflecting strong Q2 results and confidence in the integrated model, offsetting utilization/program exit headwinds. |
| **2026-2030** | **4.0%** | **4.0%** | A conservative rate below the 2025 projected growth, reflecting the company's size and the nature of the mature US healthcare market. This incorporates growth drivers like the strategic ramp-up of **Oak Street Health** and **Signify Health** value-based care assets, continued PBM share stability, the benefits of the **Cordavis** biosimilar initiative, and retail market share gains from competitor closures (e.g., Rite Aid acquisition) [cite: 2 (step 2), 5 (step 2), 11 (step 2), 12 (step 2)]. It is also conservative against potential future government policy/reimbursement pressures. |

#### C. Net Income Margin Rationale (2025-2030)

| Year | GAAP Net Income Margin | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | **1.26%** | Calculated from 2025 midpoint GAAP EPS guidance (\$3.89) and Revenue guidance (\$391.5B). This low margin is explicitly due to significant one-time items, including non-deductible litigation charges and high amortization of intangibles from recent large acquisitions. [cite: 15 (step 2), 1 (step 4), 8 (step 4)] |
| **2026-2030** | **2.0%** | A highly conservative assumption for GAAP margin recovery. It assumes a significant reduction in large, non-recurring litigation charges and restructuring costs (which depress the 2025 GAAP EPS) but maintains a conservative long-term profitability view, acknowledging ongoing industry pricing pressure and high, persistent amortization of goodwill/intangibles from the Aetna, Signify, and Oak Street deals. This level is still well below the Adjusted Operating Income margin guidance and is therefore conservative. |

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

The core DCF uses Net Income as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), as per the instruction: "Assume that net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."

#### A. Valuation Rates

| Metric | Rate | Justification (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **7.0%** | A conservative, yet reasonable, cost of equity proxy for a large, diversified, and stable healthcare company with a low beta. |
| **Maturity (Terminal) Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | A very conservative rate, representing long-term growth slightly above the expected long-term inflation rate in a mature industry. |

#### B. Projected Financials and Discounted Cash Flow

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Net Income Margin | Initial Net Income (NI) (Millions USD) | ROIC Income (Millions USD) | Total NI/FCFE (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (7.0%) | NPV of FCFE (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 391,500 | 1.26% | 4,920 | 0 | **4,920** | 0.9346 | 4,598 |
| **2026** | 407,160 | 2.00% | 8,143 | 221 | **8,364** | 0.8734 | 7,308 |
| **2027** | 423,446 | 2.00% | 8,469 | 376 | **8,845** | 0.8163 | 7,222 |
| **2028** | 440,384 | 2.00% | 8,808 | 398 | **9,206** | 0.7629 | 7,025 |
| **2029** | 457,999 | 2.00% | 9,160 | 414 | **9,574** | 0.7130 | 6,825 |
| **2030** | 476,319 | 2.00% | 9,526 | 431 | **9,957** | 0.6663 | 6,634 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | - | - | - | - | **341,900** | 0.6663 | 227,868 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | | | | | **257,480** |

**Notes on Calculations:**

1.  **Initial NI 2025:** Calculated using the midpoint of the revised 2025 GAAP EPS guidance (\$3.89) \* Shares Outstanding (1,265.02 million).
2.  **ROIC Income:** $4.5% \* (Total NI/FCFE from Previous Year).
3.  **Terminal Value (TV):** Calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the 2030 Net Income as the final cash flow: $TV = FCFE_2030 \times (1 + g) / (r - g)$.
    *   $TV = 9,957 \times (1 + 0.02) / (0.07 - 0.02) = 10,156.14 / 0.05 = **$203,123 million**
    *   **Self-Correction:** The rule requires *Net Income* for the final year to go into TV. The final year of the *projection period* is 2030.
    *   $TV = NI_{2030} \times (1 + g) / (r - g)$.
    *   Using *Total NI/FCFE* as the proxy for the entire cash generation for 2030:
    *   $TV = 9,957 \times (1 + 0.02) / (0.07 - 0.02) = **$203,123 million**.
    *   **Final Year Cash Flow (2030):** The TV replaces the 2030 cash flow for the TV calculation, but the *actual* 2030 cash flow must be included in the sum of discounted cash flows. This is a subtle nuance, and the traditional method discounts the TV to the end of year 5 (2030), and excludes the single year FCFE for year 5. Following the rule *exactly* (NI until 2030, then a conservative maturity rate):

    **Recalculation with Maturity Rate Applied to Last Projected Cash Flow:**

    $Terminal Value = \frac{CashFlow_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{9,957 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.07 - 0.02} = \mathbf{\$203,123 \text{ million}}$

    Discount Terminal Value to NPV: $\frac{203,123}{(1 + 0.07)^5} = \mathbf{\$144,858 \text{ million}}$

    *The instruction is ambiguous about which cash flow gets the terminal rate. To be most conservative, I will calculate TV using 2030 FCFE and discount the TV as of the beginning of 2031 (end of 2030).*

| Year | Total NI/FCFE (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (7.0%) | NPV of FCFE (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025 | 4,920 | 0.9346 | 4,598 |
| 2026 | 8,364 | 0.8734 | 7,308 |
| 2027 | 8,845 | 0.8163 | 7,222 |
| 2028 | 9,206 | 0.7629 | 7,025 |
| 2029 | 9,574 | 0.7130 | 6,825 |
| **2030 (Last FCFE Year)** | **9,957** | **0.6663** | 6,634 |
| **Terminal Value (TV) @ Year 5** | 203,123 | 0.7130 | 144,858 |
| **Total Sum of NPV of Cash Flows** | | | **184,510** |

*The terminal value is discounted one year earlier (to the end of 2029 / beginning of 2030) if it uses the Year 2030 cash flow and the last projected cash flow is 2030 FCFE. To avoid double-counting or confusion, I will use the TV calculation on $FCFE_{2030}$ and discount it to the end of 2030, which is the end of the final year.*

*   **NPV of Terminal Value:** $TV / (1+r)^6 = 203,123 / 1.5007 = \mathbf{\$135,357}$ (Discounted to beginning of 2025)
*   **Total NPV of FCFE (2025-2030):** $4,598 + 7,308 + 7,222 + 7,025 + 6,825 + 6,634 = \mathbf{\$39,612 \text{ million}}$
*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** $39,612 + 135,357 = \mathbf{\$174,969 \text{ million}}$

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $174,969 | Sum of NPV of Projections (2025-2030) + NPV of Terminal Value |
| **Add: Total Liquid Assets** | $14,173 | Cash Proxy (as of June 30, 2025) |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $(66,490)$ | Total Debt (as of June 30, 2025) |
| **Total Equity Value** | $122,652$ | $174,969 + 14,173 - 66,490$ |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 1,265.02 | In millions (as of April 23, 2025) |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$96.96** | $122,652 / 1,265.02$ |

### V. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$96.96 per share** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$81.93 per share** |
| **Difference** | **+18.35%** |

The calculated Fair Value of **$96.96 per share** suggests that CVS Health Corporation is undervalued by **18.35%** relative to its current market price of **$81.93**.

#### Justification for Disparity (Market vs. Model Assumptions)

The market's current valuation is lower than this conservative DCF model due to assumptions the market is making about future risk, primarily related to the company's profitability and capital allocation, which contrast with the model's core assumptions:

1.  **Market Fear: Profitable Growth & Margin Risk:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** The model projects a conservative recovery to a 2.0% GAAP Net Income Margin for 2026-2030, assuming one-time litigation/restructuring charges subside.
    *   **Market View:** The market is likely pricing in a more protracted period of severely depressed GAAP profitability. The significant legal charges and the **narrow 1.26% projected GAAP margin for 2025** is heavily weighing on investor confidence, suggesting that these "one-time" issues are actually recurring problems (opioid/Omnicare litigation) [cite: 1 (step 4), 8 (step 4)]. The market may believe the full, unadjusted cost of running the business, including high amortization of intangibles from large acquisitions, will keep the GAAP Net Income margin suppressed near the 1.25% level for longer.

2.  **Uncertainty in New Business Segments (Oak Street/Signify):**
    *   **Model Assumption:** The 4.0% revenue growth is partially driven by the synergistic ramp-up of the acquired health service assets (Oak Street and Signify Health) and the integrated model.
    *   **Market View:** The market is discounting the value creation from these expensive acquisitions until there is clear evidence of the promised margin recovery and synergy realization in the core Aetna segment, which has been challenged by elevated utilization and premium deficiency reserves [cite: 1 (step 4)].

3.  **Conservative Discount Rate:**
    *   **Model Assumption:** The 7.0% discount rate is relatively low, reflecting CVS's stable cash flows and low market risk (beta).
    *   **Market View:** If the market perceives the underlying business to be riskier due to the intense political scrutiny on PBMs (Caremark) and Medicare Advantage (Aetna), they would apply a higher discount rate. A higher discount rate (e.g., 8.0% or 9.0%) would significantly lower the present value of the Terminal Value and bring the Fair Value closer to the current stock price.

**Conclusion:** The DCF model suggests a margin of safety exists, primarily because the market is assigning a higher risk premium (discount rate) and/or assuming the recurring nature of non-operating charges (litigation, integration, amortization) will prevent the GAAP Net Income margin from recovering above a sub-2.0% level. The current price is essentially an acknowledgement of the **$66.5 billion in debt** and a projection of perpetually low GAAP earnings due to business-related risks and historical liabilities.
