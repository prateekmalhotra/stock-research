### **2. Business Engine & Future Assumptions**

Inchcape's business engine is transitioning from a mixed Retail/Distribution model to a "pureplay automotive Distributor," which is explicitly stated by management as being **capital-light, highly cash-generative, and higher-margin**. The future growth is underpinned by:

1.  **Organic Volume Growth:** Outperformance of the underlying market, which management targets to deliver an **Organic Volume CAGR of 3% to 5%** for FY 2025 to FY 2030.
2.  **New Contracts:** The scaling of 44 distribution contracts won since 2021, with an average contract expected to deliver $\text{£20m}$ to $\text{£30m}$ in revenue at maturity.

#### **A. Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)**

To remain conservative while aligning with management's strategic outlook, the following assumptions are used:

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth Rate (CAGR 2025-2030)** | $\text{4.0%}$ | Conservative mid-point of the management-guided Organic Volume CAGR of $\text{3%}$ to $\text{5%}$ for the medium term. This compounds the $\text{£9,263m}$ FY 2024 Revenue base. |

| Year | Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual Base)** | $\text{9,263}$ | |
| **FY 2025** | $\text{9,634}$ | $\text{9,263} \times \text{1.040}$ |
| **FY 2026** | $\text{10,020}$ | $\text{9,634} \times \text{1.040}$ |
| **FY 2027** | $\text{10,421}$ | $\text{10,020} \times \text{1.040}$ |
| **FY 2028** | $\text{10,838}$ | $\text{10,421} \times \text{1.040}$ |
| **FY 2029** | $\text{11,271}$ | $\text{10,838} \times \text{1.040}$ |
| **FY 2030** | $\text{11,722}$ | $\text{11,271} \times \text{1.040}$ |

#### **B. Margin and Profit Projections (2025 - 2030)**

The Distribution-focused business is expected to deliver "resilient operating margins of c. 6%".

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adjusted Operating Margin** | $\text{6.0%}$ | Conservative-to-target margin (below the FY 2024 $\text{6.3%}$) reflecting prudent caution for potential industry/FX headwinds while adhering to management's 'c. 6%' medium-term target. |
| **Tax Rate** | $\text{30.0%}$ | Conservative assumption, slightly lower than the FY 2024 rate of $\text{31.3%}$ due to Pillar Two adjustments, but still higher than many corporate tax rates. |
| **ROIC** | $\text{20.0%}$ | Prudent and conservative estimate, well below the historical $\text{27.0%}$ ROCE and the $\text{25\%}$ to $\text{30\%}$ medium-term target. This addresses the requirement to be conservative with future assumptions. |

### **3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**

The projected Net Income is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF), as management targets a FCF/PAT conversion of **c. 100%**.

#### **DCF Model Inputs:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** $\text{10.0%}$ (Conservative, but reasonable rate for an international distributor with exposure to emerging markets).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** $\text{2.0%}$ (Conservative long-term growth rate, well below the $\text{4.0%}$ revenue CAGR assumption, suggesting market saturation and maturity after the current growth cycle).

#### **Cash Flow Projection and NPV Calculation ($\text{£m}$):**

| Year | Revenue ($\text{£m}$) | Operating Profit ($\text{£m}$) | Net Income (Base) ($\text{£m}$) | ROIC Income ($\text{£m}$) | Net Income/FCF ($\text{£m}$) | Discount Factor at $\text{10.0%}$ | NPV ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | $\text{9,263}$ | $\text{584.0}$ | $\text{284.4}$ | - | $\text{284.4}$ | $\text{1.000}$ | - |
| **FY 2025** | $\text{9,634}$ | $\text{578.0}$ | $\text{404.6}$ | $\text{56.9}$ | $\text{461.5}$ | $\text{0.909}$ | $\text{419.5}$ |
| **FY 2026** | $\text{10,020}$ | $\text{601.2}$ | $\text{420.8}$ | $\text{92.3}$ | $\text{513.1}$ | $\text{0.826}$ | $\text{423.8}$ |
| **FY 2027** | $\text{10,421}$ | $\text{625.3}$ | $\text{437.7}$ | $\text{102.6}$ | $\text{540.3}$ | $\text{0.751}$ | $\text{405.8}$ |
| **FY 2028** | $\text{10,838}$ | $\text{650.3}$ | $\text{455.2}$ | $\text{108.1}$ | $\text{563.3}$ | $\text{0.683}$ | $\text{384.8}$ |
| **FY 2029** | $\text{11,271}$ | $\text{676.3}$ | $\text{473.4}$ | $\text{112.7}$ | $\text{586.1}$ | $\text{0.621}$ | $\text{364.1}$ |
| **FY 2030** | $\text{11,722}$ | $\text{703.3}$ | $\text{492.3}$ | $\text{117.2}$ | $\text{609.5}$ | $\text{0.564}$ | $\text{343.8}$ |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | | $\text{609.5}$ | | $\text{5,453.6}$ |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flows** | | | | | | | $\text{7,795.4}$ |

***Calculations Explained:***
*   **Operating Profit:** Revenue * $\text{6.0%}$ Operating Margin.
*   **Net Income (Base):** Operating Profit * $(\text{1} - \text{0.300})$ Tax Rate. (Assuming no significant change in net finance costs which were $\text{£142m}$ in FY 2024, PBT/Operating Profit is simplified here).
*   **ROIC Income for next year:** Net Income/FCF from previous year * $\text{20.0%}$ ROIC.
    *   *FY 2025 ROIC Income:* $\text{284.4m}$ (2024 base NI) * $\text{0.20}$ = $\text{56.9m}$.
*   **Net Income/FCF:** Net Income (Base) + ROIC Income.
*   **Terminal Value (TV):** $(\text{FCF in FY 2030} \times (\text{1} + \text{g})) / (\text{WACC} - \text{g})$
    *   TV in FY 2030: $(\text{609.5} \times \text{1.02}) / (\text{0.10} - \text{0.02}) = \text{7,770.0m}$
    *   NPV of TV: $\text{7,770.0m} \times \text{0.564}$ (FY 2030 Discount Factor) = $\text{4,379.8m}$
    *   *Note: For the final total NPV, the individual cash flows plus the NPV of the Terminal Value are summed.*

### **4. Fair Value Calculation**

The fair value of the equity is calculated by starting with the Total NPV of the business (Enterprise Value), subtracting debt, and adding cash.

| Metric | Value ($\text{£m}$) | Calculation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future FCFs (Enterprise Value)** | $\text{7,795.4}$ | Sum of NPV of all Projected FCFs + NPV of Terminal Value. |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $\text{1,041.0}$ | Gross Total Debt from FY 2024 Balance Sheet. |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $\text{549.0}$ | Cash and Short Term Investments from FY 2024 Balance Sheet. |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | $\text{7,303.4}$ | $\text{7,795.4} - \text{1,041.0} + \text{549.0}$ |
| **Shares Outstanding (Millions)** | $\text{394.0}$ | Used the FY 2024 end-of-year figure as the base. |
| **Fair Value Per Share (GBP)** | $\text{18.54}$ | $\text{7,303.4} / \text{394.0}$ |

### **Justification and Market Disparity Analysis**

The calculated fair value of $\text{£18.54}$ is **141% higher** than the current market price of $\text{£7.69}$. This significant disparity requires a strong justification.

The core reason for the discrepancy lies in the market's skepticism regarding the sustainability and magnitude of the company's stated medium-term financial targets and the successful execution of its "pureplay automotive Distributor" strategy.

| Valuation Assumption | Market's Implicit Assumption (Skepticism) | Justification for Disparity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.0% Revenue CAGR (2025-2030)** | Market assumes a much lower CAGR, likely closer to $\text{1\%}$ - $\text{2\%}$ due to: 1) Cyclicality/volatility of the global auto market. 2) Foreign exchange volatility (which management acknowledged is a headwind). 3) Execution risk in integrating new contracts and exiting retail operations. | My assumption is directly from management guidance of $\text{3\%}$ to $\text{5\%}$. If the market assumes $\text{2\%}$ growth, the valuation drops significantly. |
| **6.0% Operating Margin** | Market assumes margins will revert towards a lower, more cyclical historical average, perhaps $\text{4\%}$ - $\text{5\%}$, as competition in distribution markets increases or as new contracts take longer to reach maturity. | My assumption uses the stated medium-term target of **c. 6%** for the new, higher-margin distribution model. This is a major factor in the high valuation. |
| **20.0% ROIC** | Market believes the transition to "capital-light" distribution is incomplete or that the new capital-light business is inherently subject to working capital demands, leading to a much lower real ROIC and FCF conversion over the cycle. | My $\text{20.0\%}$ ROIC is already a **conservative discount** to the $\text{25\%}$ - $\text{30\%}$ management target. If the market projects an ROIC closer to $\text{10\%}$, the valuation would be much lower. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate of 2.0%** | Market may be applying a zero or negative terminal growth rate, implying that the distribution model is at risk of disruption from direct-to-consumer models being pursued by OEMs. | My assumption is conservative for a long-lived international business but still positive. Any assumption of long-term contraction will wipe out significant value. |

**Conclusion on Disparity:**

The valuation is an **"Execution Success"** valuation, where all of management's medium-term strategic targets for a profitable, capital-light global distributor are met. The market, however, is pricing in a significant **Execution Risk Discount**. For the stock to trade at $\text{£7.69}$, the market is implicitly assuming a combination of:
1.  **Lower Growth:** Long-term growth significantly below the $\text{4.0\%}$ modeled CAGR.
2.  **Margin Contraction:** Failure to sustain $\text{6.0\%}$ operating margins.
3.  **Lower Return/Higher Capital Needs:** A real FCF conversion and ROIC much lower than the management targets.

The fair value of $\text{£18.54}$ suggests that if Inchcape successfully executes its transition to a pureplay distributor and meets its $\text{>10\%}$ EPS CAGR target, the stock is currently a deep-value opportunity. The current market price reflects high skepticism that the company can transition its financial profile as successfully as it projects.
