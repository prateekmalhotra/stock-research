## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Inchcape's business model is shifting to a pure-play automotive distributor, which is characterized by a high-margin, capital-light structure with a strong focus on Aftersales (30% of Gross Profit in 2024) and scaling through distribution contract wins.

The core revenue engine for the projection is driven by two components, aligned with management's **Accelerate+** strategy:

1.  **Market Outperformance/Volume Growth:** Inchcape targets a 3.0% to 5.0% Organic Volume CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) by outperforming the market's expected 1% to 2% growth.
2.  **New Contracts & Acquisitions:** The business has won 40+ contracts since 2021, each expected to contribute $\text{£20m}$ to $\text{£30m}$ in revenue at maturity. The long-term ambition is to grow market share from 3% to 10%, which would "treble the size of the business".

### **Conservative Revenue Projection Assumptions:**

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volume/Organic Growth Rate** | 3.5% CAGR | Mid-point of management's 3%-5% organic volume CAGR target, a conservative estimate based on the goal of outperforming the market. |
| **Revenue Multiple Factor** | 1.0% p.a. | A conservative additional revenue factor to account for the financial impact of new contract wins (22 in 2024) and bolt-on acquisitions **above** the organic volume growth. This factor tapers down in later years as the model is conservative. |
| **Total Revenue Growth Rate** | $\approx$ 4.5% - 4.1% p.a. | Sum of Organic Growth + Revenue Factor. |

### **Projected Revenue and Net Income (in £m)**

| Year | R_t ($\text{£m}$) | Growth Rate | NI\_Margin | NI\_t ($\text{£m}$) | Cash Inflow from ROIC | Total Cash Flow (CF) ($\text{£m}$) |

### **Margin & Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Justification**

*   **Net Income Margin:** The margin increases conservatively from 4.68% (FY2024) to **5.30%** by 2030. This is justified by the strategic shift to a pure-play distributor model which is inherently higher-margin and less capital intensive than the retail model that was disposed. The growth of the high-margin Aftersales business (30% of gross profit) supports this margin expansion.
*   **ROIC (Reinvestment Efficiency):**
    *   **Assumption:** The net income from the previous year is assumed to be cash available for reinvestment, generating additional income in the following year (ROIC from cash).
    *   **ROIC % used:** 27% (Based on the actual FY 2024 reported ROCE). Management's high ROCE (27% in 2024) is a key feature of the new capital-light model.
    *   **Calculation (example t=1):** $\text{NI}_{2025} = \text{Revenue}_{2025} \times \text{NI\_Margin}_{2025} = \text{£466m}$. $\text{Cash Flow from ROIC}_{2025} = \text{NI}_{2024} \times \text{ROIC (27\%)} = \text{£435m} \times 27\% = \text{£118m}$.
    *   **Total Cash Flow (CF) for DCF:** $\text{CF}_t = \text{NI}_t + \text{Cash Inflow from ROIC}_t$.

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### **Conservative Discount & Maturity Rates**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** 9.0%
    *   *Justification:* This is a conservative WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) proxy. It reflects a high rate for a company operating in volatile emerging markets (Americas, APAC) and the cyclical nature of the automotive distribution business, while still acknowledging its strong execution and high ROIC/low leverage.
*   **Terminal/Maturity Growth Rate (Very Conservative):** 1.5%
    *   *Justification:* This assumes the company's growth rate will drop significantly below its medium-term target (3.5% organic) to slightly above the long-term GDP growth for a mature economy. This is a very conservative assumption for a company with a long-term goal to *treble its size* and is used to capture the value of all cash flows beyond 2030.

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

The **Cash Flow (CF)** used for DCF is the **Total Cash Flow** ($\text{NI}_t + \text{Cash Inflow from ROIC}_t$).

| Year (t) | Total Cash Flow ($\text{£m}$) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow ($\text{£m}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | 584 | 0.917 | 536 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | 655 | 0.842 | 551 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | 712 | 0.772 | 550 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | 770 | 0.708 | 545 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | 831 | 0.650 | 540 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | 894 | 0.596 | 533 |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **3,255** |

### **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation**

The Terminal Value captures the value of all cash flows from 2031 to perpetuity.

$$ \text{TV} = \frac{\text{CF}_{\text{t=6}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{r} - \text{g}} $$

Where:
*   $\text{CF}_{\text{t=6}} = \text{£894m}$ (2030 Total Cash Flow)
*   $\text{g}$ (Terminal Growth Rate) = 1.5%
*   $\text{r}$ (Discount Rate) = 9.0%

$$ \text{TV}_{\text{2030}} = \frac{894 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.09 - 0.015} = \frac{907.41}{0.075} = \text{£12,099m} $$

### **NPV of Terminal Value (NPV\_TV)**

$$ \text{NPV\_TV} = \text{TV}_{\text{2030}} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{\text{t=6}} = \text{£12,099m} \times 0.596 = \text{£7,205m} $$

### **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)**

$$ \text{TEV} = \text{NPV of Projected Cash Flows} + \text{NPV of Terminal Value} $$

$$ \text{TEV} = \text{£3,255m} + \text{£7,205m} = \text{£10,460m} $$

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{TEV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Total Debt} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{£10,460m} + \text{£549m} - \text{£1,041m} = \text{£9,968m} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}} $$

$$ \text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{£9,968m}}{408.288 \text{m}} = \text{£24.41} $$

## 5. Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **£24.41** |
| **Current Market Price per Share** | **£8.31** |
| **Difference** | **+193.7%** |

### **Justification for the Valuation Difference**

The calculated Fair Value of $\text{£24.41}$ is approximately **194% higher** than the current market price of $\text{£8.31}$. This significant difference suggests that the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Inchcape's future profitability and growth than the management's own medium-term guidance and the inherent economics of the business model.

**Assumptions Embedded in the Market Price (£8.31):**

The market appears to be skeptical about Inchcape's ability to execute on its "pure-play distributor" strategy and achieve the guided targets. The current price likely discounts one or more of the following risks/factors:

1.  **Sustained Low Margin/Cyclicality:** The market may be assuming the Net Income Margin will remain close to historical levels (e.g., closer to 3.0-3.5%) rather than expanding to the projected 5.3% due to the cyclical and competitive nature of the automotive industry.
2.  **Failure of New Contracts to Mature:** The valuation heavily relies on the success of the 40+ new distribution contracts and the goal to treble the business. The market likely assigns a much lower probability to this ambitious execution, effectively discounting the growth rate to 0-1% beyond a few years.
3.  **ROIC Compression:** The market may not believe the exceptionally high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 27% is sustainable long-term. Inchcape's high ROCE is a function of its capital-light model post-disposals, and if future acquisitions or inventory needs require more capital, the ROIC will drop significantly.
4.  **Terminal Value Discounting:** An $\text{£8.31}$ share price could be explained by a model using the same inputs but a drastically higher discount rate (e.g., 12-14%) and a terminal growth rate of **0%**, reflecting an assumption that the business has no perpetual growth.

**Justification for the High Fair Value:**

My Fair Value is a direct translation of Inchcape's own stated strategic targets and financial profile:

1.  **Management Guidance is Truth:** The rules require using management's commentary as truth. The projected 3.5% organic growth (mid-point of 3-5% target) and increasing margins towards 5.3% are justified by the high-value focus on the distribution segment and aftersales growth.
2.  **High ROIC is Economic Reality:** The high, capital-light ROCE of 27% is a result of the fundamental shift away from the capital-intensive retail model. Using this rate for reinvestment is economically sound for a value-accretive distribution business.
3.  **Conservative Terminal Rate:** The 1.5% terminal growth rate is already highly conservative given the company's long-term goal to triple the business size.

The market is being overly pessimistic and discounting the entire value creation from the transformation to a pure-play automotive distributor, offering a deep discount on the company's officially projected value. If Inchcape delivers on its stated $ >10\%$ EPS CAGR medium-term target, the stock is severely undervalued.
