### II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The valuation relies on a conservative but reasonable projection model based on key business drivers and management commentary.

#### 1. Revenue Projection Justification

Align's core business engine is driven by **Clear Aligner Volume** and the increasing adoption of its digital ecosystem (iTero scanners and exocad software), partially offset by **Average Selling Price (ASP) headwinds** due to product mix shift to lower-priced products and geographic expansion into emerging markets.

*   **Key Drivers & Management Commentary:**
    *   For 2026, management guided worldwide revenue growth of 3% to 4% and Clear Aligner volume growth in the mid-single digits year-over-year.
    *   Long-term strategy is focused on "five to fifteen" targets, implying long-term growth potential.
    *   The teen and kids segment is a strong driver (up 7.8% YoY in 2025).
    *   International and Dental Service Organization (DSO) channels show strong growth (double-digit and triple-digit growth in some regions/channels in Q4 2025).
    *   ASP pressure is expected to continue due to mix shift.

*   **Conservative Revenue Growth Assumptions:**
    *   **2026:** Use the conservative end of management guidance: **3.0%**.
    *   **2027 - 2030:** As the company benefits from global scaling, new products (e.g., Palate Expander), and cost management, the growth rate is conservatively assumed to improve, but remain below historical peaks to account for competitive pressures and macro uncertainty. I project a constant revenue growth rate of **5.5%** per year.

#### 2. Margin Projection Justification

*   **Net Income Margin:** The 2025 GAAP Net Income Margin is 10.17%. Management guided a 2026 Non-GAAP operating margin of $\approx 23.7\%$ (a $100$ bps improvement). This suggests significant leverage and cost-structure improvement. I will conservatively model the GAAP Net Income margin to slowly recover as cost-saving measures take effect and revenue scales, assuming some non-GAAP adjustments remain persistent.
    *   **Initial Margin (2026):** **11.5%** (a $133$ bps improvement over 2025, reflecting only a fraction of the operating margin improvement).
    *   **Terminal Margin (2030):** **14.0%** (a gradual 50 bps annual improvement, which is still highly conservative compared to the Non-GAAP operating margin).

#### 3. ROIC and Discount Rate Assumptions

*   **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** A conservative ROIC of **10.0%** is applied to the accumulated cash (from the previous year's projected Net Income) to generate a conservative additional income, recognizing the company's efficient use of capital in a high gross margin business (Q4 2025 GAAP Gross Margin was 65.3%).
*   **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy):** A conservative but reasonable rate of **9.0%** is used.
*   **Maturity Rate (g):** A very conservative perpetual growth rate of **2.5%** is used, slightly above long-term inflation, for the Terminal Value calculation.

### III. Projected Income and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The cash flow for the DCF is approximated by the adjusted Net Income:
**Projected Cash Flow for Year $t$ = (Net Income for Year $t$) + (ROIC on Accumulated Cash from Year $t-1$)**

| Year | Revenue (A) | Rev Growth Rate | NI Margin (B) | Net Income (C) = A * B | Accumulated Cash from NI (D) | ROIC Income (E) = D * 10.0% | Cash Flow (CF) (F) = C + E | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) (G) = F * DF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Base) | \$4,035.0 | $0.9\%$ | $10.17\%$ | \$410.4 | \$410.4 | - | - | - | - |
| **2026** | \$4,156.1 | $3.0\%$ | $11.50\%$ | \$478.0 | \$888.4 | \$41.0 | **\$519.0** | 0.9174 | **\$476.1** |
| **2027** | \$4,384.7 | $5.5\%$ | $12.00\%$ | \$526.2 | \$1,414.6 | \$88.8 | **\$615.0** | 0.8417 | **\$517.7** |
| **2028** | \$4,625.8 | $5.5\%$ | $12.50\%$ | \$578.2 | \$1,992.8 | \$141.5 | **\$719.7** | 0.7722 | **\$555.8** |
| **2029** | \$4,879.6 | $5.5\%$ | $13.00\%$ | \$634.3 | \$2,627.1 | \$199.3 | **\$833.6** | 0.7084 | **\$590.5** |
| **2030** | \$5,148.5 | $5.5\%$ | $14.00\%$ | \$720.8 | \$3,347.9 | \$262.7 | **\$983.5** | 0.6499 | **\$639.2** |
| **NPV of Forecasted CFs** | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | **\$2,779.3** |

#### 4. Terminal Value Calculation

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model with the 2030 Cash Flow (F) as the final year cash flow:

**Terminal Value** $= \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{g}} = \frac{\$983.5 \times (1 + 0.025)}{0.090 - 0.025} = \frac{\$1,008.1}{\text{0.065}} = \text{\$15,509.2}$

**Terminal Value NPV** $= \text{Terminal Value} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030} = \$15,509.2 \times 0.6499 = \text{\$10,080.8}$

#### 5. Enterprise and Equity Value

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Forecasted CFs (2026-2030) | \$2,779.3 |
| NPV of Terminal Value (2030) | \$10,080.8 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **\$12,860.1** |
| Add: Total Cash & Equivalents (CASH) | \$1,094.9 |
| Less: Total Debt (DEBT) | (\$121.3) |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$13,833.7** |
| Shares Outstanding (DILUTED) | $71.757 \text{ million}$ |
| **FAIR VALUE PER SHARE** | **\$192.78** |

### IV. Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value per Share (Calculated)** | **\$192.78** |
| **Current Market Price (Example)** | *Assume a current market price of $150.00 for comparison.* |

**Fair Value per Share: \$192.78**

#### Justification for Discrepancy

The calculated Fair Value of **\$192.78** is significantly higher than the assumed current market price (e.g., $150.00).

**The Market's Conservative Assumptions:**

The market is likely applying a more severe discount and a lower growth profile than this conservative DCF model due to several key factors that have historically plagued the company:

1.  **Competitive Pressure and ASP Erosion:** The market is factoring in a more rapid and deeper ASP decline from direct-to-consumer and other low-cost competitors than my model anticipates. My model implicitly assumes the superior technology, doctor channel, and new products (like the Palatal Expander) will preserve a profitable price point, whereas the market may assume a more protracted "race to the bottom" on price.
2.  **Growth Slowdown:** The market is likely discounting management's long-term "five to fifteen" plan and is pricing the stock based on the very slow 2025 growth (0.9% YoY) and the modest 2026 guidance (3.0%-4.0%). The market's implied long-term growth rate is likely closer to **4.0%-4.5%** or is using a much higher discount rate, reflecting high macroeconomic uncertainty that has historically impacted elective procedures.
3.  **Restructuring and Margin Volatility:** Although management is guiding for non-GAAP margin improvement, the market remains skeptical due to recent restructuring costs and GAAP margin volatility. The market may be using a lower terminal GAAP net income margin (e.g., closer to the 10-12% range) or a higher WACC to account for execution risk related to these turnarounds.

**Justification for DCF's Higher Valuation:**

This valuation remains bullish on the long-term potential because it is anchored to Align's key competitive advantages and management's long-term plan, albeit conservatively:

1.  **High Barriers to Entry:** The Invisalign system's massive data set, AI capabilities, and high-tech manufacturing capacity represent a substantial competitive moats that lower-cost competitors cannot easily replicate.
2.  **Doctor Adoption:** The company's focus on the doctor-led professional channel (Orthodontists and GPs) and the DSO channel, which provides scale, insulates it from the consumer-led pricing wars more effectively than a pure direct-to-consumer model. The continued increase in new patient starts and doctor engagement validates this strategy.
3.  **Conservative Margins and ROIC:** Even with an aggressive revenue recovery (5.5% post-2026), the terminal net income margin of 14.0% is still substantially lower than the peak non-GAAP operating margins the company has achieved, providing a margin of safety against margin compression. The $10.0\%$ ROIC is justified by the capital efficiency inherent in a digital platform and repeat consumable business model. The $2.5\%$ perpetual growth rate is a very conservative assumption for a company with a long runway in the global dental market.
