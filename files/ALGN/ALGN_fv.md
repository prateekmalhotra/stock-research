## II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

Align Technology's business is fundamentally driven by two segments:

1.  **Clear Aligners (Invisalign):** Driven by **Case Volume Growth** (number of patients) and **Average Selling Price (ASP)**.
2.  **Systems and Services (iTero & exocad):** Driven by **Scanner/Software Unit Sales** and **Recurring Service Revenues**.

### A. Business Engine Assumptions (Based on Last 4 Earnings Calls)

Management commentary indicates a challenging near-term environment (sluggish US market, economic uncertainties) but a robust long-term international market opportunity (APAC, EMEA) and strong adoption of new technology (iTero Lumina, new products like Palatal Expander).

| Metric | FY 2024 Base / Guidance | Long-Term Assumption (2026-2030) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 Revenue (LTM)** | $3,964.8 million (Q3'24-Q2'25) | N/A | Calculated from last four reported quarters. |
| **FY 2025 Revenue Growth** | Flat to slightly up (management guidance) | **1.0%** | Conservative estimate using the low end of "flat to slightly up" guidance. |
| **Clear Aligner Volume Growth** | Mid-single digits (FY 2025 guidance) | **4.0% - 6.0%** | Starts at 4.0% (conservative for 2026, slightly below mid-single-digit guidance) and gradually steps down to 3.0% by 2030 to reflect market maturation and increased competition. |
| **Clear Aligner ASP Trend** | Down YoY (due to mix shift, discounts) | **-1.0% per year** | Conservative assumption of continued ASP decline as the product mix shifts to lower-priced non-comprehensive treatments and emerging markets grow. This offsets most of the volume growth. |
| **Systems & Services (S&S) Growth** | Faster than Clear Aligner (FY 2025 guidance) | **8.0% - 4.0%** | Starts higher (8.0%) to reflect the immediate impact of the successful iTero Lumina launch and high recurring service revenue growth, then scales down to 4.0% by 2030 as the installed base matures and scanner sales normalize. |

### B. Revenue Projections (in millions USD)

The total revenue projection is the sum of Clear Aligner (CA) Revenue and Systems & Services (S&S) Revenue.

*   **FY 2024 Base Revenue (LTM):** $3,964.8M
    *   *CA Revenue Base:* $\approx$ 80% of LTM Revenue $\approx$ $3,171.8M
    *   *S&S Revenue Base:* $\approx$ 20% of LTM Revenue $\approx$ $793.0M

| Year | CA Volume Growth | CA ASP Change | CA Revenue Growth | S&S Revenue Growth | Total Revenue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | **$4,004.5** |
| **2026** | 4.0% | -1.0% | 2.9% | 8.0% | **$4,153.9** |
| **2027** | 4.0% | -1.0% | 2.9% | 7.0% | **$4,309.8** |
| **2028** | 3.5% | -1.0% | 2.5% | 6.0% | **$4,472.0** |
| **2029** | 3.0% | -1.0% | 2.0% | 5.0% | **$4,639.6** |
| **2030** | 3.0% | -1.0% | 2.0% | 4.0% | **$4,814.7** |

## III. Margin and Net Income Projections

### A. Margin Assumptions

Margins are based on management's non-GAAP guidance, assuming successful execution of the restructuring plan to drive efficiency. Non-GAAP metrics are used as a proxy for *normalized* operating profitability.

*   **FY 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Margin (Est.):** $\approx$ 22.5% (Based on last 4 quarters' non-GAAP margins and guidance).
*   **FY 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Margin (Guidance):** Slightly above 22.5%. I will use a conservative **23.0%**.
*   **Long-Term Operating Margin:** ALGN is a high-gross-margin technology/IP company. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is projected to expand modestly due to scaling international volumes, manufacturing efficiencies, and the higher-margin Systems & Services recurring revenue stream.

| Year | Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) | Tax Rate (Conservative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 23.0% | 21.0% |
| **2026** | 24.0% | 21.0% |
| **2027** | 25.0% | 21.0% |
| **2028** | 26.0% | 21.0% |
| **2029** | 26.5% | 21.0% |
| **2030** | 27.0% | 21.0% |

### B. Net Income Calculation (in millions USD)

The Net Income for the next year includes the **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** component as per the rule.

*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** Align's historical performance (pre-pandemic and non-GAAP) is strong. Given the capital-light nature of its business (high Gross Margin, digital platform), an ROIC is appropriate. I will use a **conservative 10.0%** as the annual return on accumulated cash from prior-year profits.

| Year | Revenue | Op Margin (Non-GAAP) | Operating Income | ROIC on Prior NI\* | Pre-Tax Income | Net Income (21% Tax) | Cumulative NI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $4,004.5 | 23.0% | $921.0 | $0.0 | $921.0 | **$727.6** | $727.6 |
| **2026** | $4,153.9 | 24.0% | $997.0 | $72.8 | $1,069.8 | **$845.1** | $1,572.7 |
| **2027** | $4,309.8 | 25.0% | $1,077.5 | $157.3$ | $1,234.8 | **$975.5** | $2,548.2 |
| **2028** | $4,472.0 | 26.0% | $1,162.7 | $254.8$ | $1,417.5 | **$1,120.8** | $3,669.0 |
| **2029** | $4,639.6 | 26.5% | $1,229.5 | $366.9$ | $1,596.4 | **$1,261.2** | $4,930.2 |
| **2030** | $4,814.7$ | 27.0% | $1,299.9$ | $493.0$ | $1,792.9 | **$1,416.4** | $6,346.6 |

\*ROIC on Prior NI is 10.0% of the *cumulative* Net Income from all preceding years.

## IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | **10.0%** | Conservative but reasonable, reflecting a cost of equity for a market leader in a high-growth sector with current macro headwinds (WACC is likely lower, so 10.0% is conservative). |
| **Maturity (Terminal) Rate** | **3.0%** | Very conservative. Reflects expected long-term nominal GDP growth and a competitive market structure in the dental/ortho industry. |
| **Terminal Year Cash Flow (2031)** | $1,458.9 million | Calculated as Net Income 2030 * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) = $1,416.4M * 1.03 |

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation (in millions USD)

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $727.6 | 0.909 | $661.4 |
| **2026** | $845.1 | 0.826 | $698.5 |
| **2027** | $975.5 | 0.751 | $732.6 |
| **2028** | $1,120.8 | 0.683 | $765.2 |
| **2029** | $1,261.2 | 0.621 | $783.3 |
| **2030** | $1,416.4 | 0.564 | $798.8 |
| **Terminal Value (TV) (2030)** | $14,589.0\* | 0.564 | $8,228.0 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **$12,667.8** |

\*Terminal Value (2030) = (Net Income 2031 / (Discount Rate - Terminal Rate)) = ($1,458.9M / (0.10 - 0.03)) = $20,841.4 million. The **Terminal Value PV** shown above is calculated as $20,841.4M * (1 / (1 + 0.10)^6)$. A simpler (and more conservative) method is to take 2030 Net Income, and apply the Terminal Rate: $1,416.4M * (1.03) / (0.10 - 0.03) * 0.564 = \$11,732.7$. Given the DCF is using net income *plus* ROIC, I will use the simpler method: **$20,841.4M / 1.7716 = $11,763.5M** which is the value of all cash flows after 2030, discounted to present day. This still seems too large given the current market cap.

**Conservative Re-Calculation of Terminal Value (TV)**

A much more conservative approach to account for the ROIC assumption is to only use the 2030 Operating Income to calculate TV, as a proxy for an unlevered free cash flow model, and use an effective tax rate of 21%:

1.  **Terminal FCF Proxy (2030):** Operating Income $\times$ (1 - Tax Rate) = $1,299.9M \times (1 - 0.21) = $1,026.9 million.
2.  **Terminal Value (TV):** $1,026.9M \times (1.03) / (0.10 - 0.03) = $15,103.7 million.
3.  **PV of TV:** $15,103.7M \times 0.564 = **$8,515.2 million.**

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) with Conservative TV:**
$661.4 + 698.5 + 732.6 + 765.2 + 783.3 + 798.8 + 8,515.2 = **$12,155.0 million**

## V. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | $12,155.0 million |
| **Add: Total Liquid Cash (A)** | $901.2 million |
| **Less: Total Debt (B)** | $120.0 million |
| **Equity Value** | **$12,936.2 million** |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | $72.593 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$178.21** |

***

## VI. Conclusion and Justification

The calculated fair value for Align Technology (ALGN) stock is **\$178.21 per share**.

*   **Fair Value:** **\$178.21**
*   **Current Market Price (Oct 24, 2025):** **\$135.21**
*   **Difference:** **+31.8%**

### Justification for Discrepancy

The market price of \$135.21 is significantly lower than the calculated fair value of \$178.21. This implies that **the market is pricing in a much slower, or even declining, long-term growth profile and/or a more aggressive competitive landscape** than the conservative model has assumed.

1.  **Market's Pessimistic Assumptions (Implicit in \$135.21 Price):**
    *   **Revenue Slowdown:** The market is likely focusing on the recent weak performance in North America, the ASP decline due to product mix shifts, and the low end of the FY 2025 revenue guidance (flat to slightly up). The market appears to be discounting the **3.0% - 4.0% long-term volume growth** (which is the foundation of the model) and the **high growth in the S&S segment**.
    *   **Margin Risk:** The market may be concerned that competition from low-cost aligners (especially in non-comprehensive cases) will permanently erode Clear Aligner Gross Margin, offsetting any gains from scale/efficiency. My model assumes a modest long-term non-GAAP operating margin expansion (to 27.0%), whereas the market might be expecting margins to flatten or decline from the current **23.0%** guidance level.
    *   **ROIC / Cash Usage:** The market may not fully value the current and future cash on the balance sheet, especially given the company's recent focus on share repurchases, which are often viewed as a less productive use of capital than M&A or high-return capex.

2.  **Model's Justified Assumptions:**
    *   **Conservative Engine:** The model uses **modest long-term volume growth (3.0% - 4.0%)** for Clear Aligners, significantly lower than the historical pre-2023 growth, and conservatively assumes **-1.0% annual ASP decline**. This is a **conservative growth engine** for a market leader in a growing, yet competitive, industry.
    *   **Justified Margin Expansion:** The projected non-GAAP operating margin expansion is reasonable because:
        *   The company is executing a **restructuring plan** specifically to "streamline operations" and expects **Non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 22.5%** in a low-growth year (2025).
        *   The high-growth Systems & Services segment, particularly recurring revenue, is a **natural margin-expander**.
    *   **Conservative Rates:** The **10.0% Discount Rate** and **3.0% Terminal Rate** are conservative for a global medical technology company, bolstering confidence in the resulting valuation.

**Conclusion:**

The valuation suggests that Align Technology is undervalued at its current market price. The market appears overly focused on the near-term economic headwinds, North American weakness, and ASP erosion, while not fully appreciating the strength of the non-U.S. growth engine, the long-term margin potential from operational restructuring, and the recurring revenue from the successful iTero scanner platform. The fair value of **\$178.21** is justified by reasonable long-term growth and profitability assumptions, anchored by management's near-term guidance.
