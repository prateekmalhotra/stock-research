## II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions

The valuation relies on projected revenue and margins from 2025 to 2030, driven by an analysis of the company's business model and management guidance.

### A. Business Engine Analysis

Envista operates in the dental products market, split into **Specialty Products & Technologies** (Implants, Orthodontics like Spark, Digital Imaging) and **Equipment & Consumables**.

*   **Growth Driver: Spark Profitability & Clear Aligner Market.** Management has indicated that its clear aligner product, Spark, is expected to achieve profitability in the second half of 2025 [cite: 8 in step 1]. This is a significant inflection point that will boost overall margin.
*   **Growth Driver: Implants and Innovation.** The company has seen continued improvement in its implants business, including Nobel Biocare in North America, and is actively investing in new product launches and R&D (e.g., a new CBCT platform, enhanced software) [cite: 7, 8 in step 1].
*   **Operational Improvement: Envista Business System (EBS).** EBS is cited as a key contributor to operational improvements, working capital, and customer service, which directly supports margin expansion and cash flow conversion. [cite: 7 in step 1, 2]
*   **Market Condition:** The dental market is described as "stable" with positive macroeconomic indicators. [cite: 7, 9 in step 1]

### B. Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

| Year | Basis / Rationale | Core Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (\$MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual Adj.)** | Previous year revenue for baseline. | N/A | 2,510.0 |
| **2025** | Use the upper end of management's revised 2025 core growth guidance (3-4%) as the basis, factoring in strong H1 momentum. | 4.0% | 2,610.4 |
| **2026** | **Conservative Estimate:** Core growth slows slightly as the post-COVID tailwind fully fades, but strong momentum from Spark profitability (H2 2025) and EBS continues to drive a stable market share gain. | 3.5% | 2,701.8 |
| **2027** | **Conservative Estimate:** Long-term market growth in the dental space, led by digital and clear aligners. Assume a slight deceleration towards maturity. | 3.0% | 2,782.8 |
| **2028** | **Conservative Estimate:** Continued deceleration to a sustainable long-term industry growth rate. | 2.5% | 2,870.9 |
| **2029** | **Conservative Estimate:** Further deceleration to a mature rate. | 2.0% | 2,958.3 |
| **2030** | **Conservative Estimate:** The terminal growth rate is used for the last projection year before maturity. | 1.8% | 3,031.5 |

### C. Margin Projections

Envista's margins have been impacted by the investment phase of Spark and macroeconomic factors. Management guidance and the expected profitability of Spark are the primary drivers for margin expansion.

| Metric | 2024 Actual (Approx.) | 2025 Projection | 2026 Projection | 2027 - 2030 Projection (Long-Term) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin** | $\sim 53.0\%$ | $54.5\%$ | $55.0\%$ | $55.5\%$ | Q2 2025 Adjusted Gross Margin was 54.4%. Spark profitability and EBS efficiency are expected to drive conservative, continuous improvement. |
| **Net Income Margin** | $\sim 3.0\%$ | $4.5\%$ | $5.5\%$ | $6.5\%$ | Based on 2025 adjusted EPS guidance ($\sim 4.4\%$ margin at mid-point). This projects a steady, conservative increase driven by SG&A leverage as Spark becomes profitable and a $\sim 14\%$ adjusted EBITDA margin is sustained and slightly grown. |

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income is used as the Free Cash Flow proxy, following the instruction to assume it goes straight into cash. The valuation incorporates the rule to add a return on the previously accumulated cash (ROIC rule).

### A. Net Income Projection (Cash Flow Proxy)

| Year | Projected Revenue (\$MM) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (\$MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 2,610.4 | 4.5% | 117.5 |
| **2026** | 2,701.8 | 5.5% | 148.6 |
| **2027** | 2,782.8 | 6.0% | 167.0 |
| **2028** | 2,870.9 | 6.5% | 186.6 |
| **2029** | 2,958.3 | 6.5% | 192.3 |
| **2030** | 3,031.5 | 6.5% | 197.0 |

### B. ROIC Assumption and Cash Flow Adjustment

*   **ROIC Assumption:** The company's reported ROIC has been low in recent years (due to impairments and business transition). Since future Net Income is projected to be positive and the instruction requires a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC, a conservative **5.0%** is used. This is below a typical WACC but represents the low-growth, low-return profile of cash.
*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **9.0%** (A standard rate for a stable, global healthcare company with a Beta of $\sim 1.02$ [cite: 6 in step 1]).
*   **Maturity (Terminal) Rate (Very Conservative):** **2.0%** (This is a long-term inflation and GDP proxy, well below the projected growth rate in 2030).

| Year | Net Income (A) (\$MM) | Cumulative Cash from Prior Year (B) (\$MM) | ROIC on Cash (B * 5.0%) (C) (\$MM) | **Total Cash Flow (A + C) (\$MM)** | Discount Factor (9.0%) | **NPV of Cash Flow (\$MM)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 117.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | **117.5** | 0.917 | 107.7 |
| **2026** | 148.6 | 117.5 | 5.9 | **154.5** | 0.842 | 130.1 |
| **2027** | 167.0 | 272.0 | 13.6 | **180.6** | 0.772 | 139.5 |
| **2028** | 186.6 | 452.6 | 22.6 | **209.2** | 0.708 | 148.1 |
| **2029** | 192.3 | 661.8 | 33.1 | **225.4** | 0.650 | 146.5 |
| **2030** | 197.0 | 887.2 | 44.4 | **241.4** | 0.596 | 143.9 |
| **Terminal Value** | | | | | | |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The terminal cash flow is the final projected cash flow, grown by the maturity rate and discounted back to present value.

1.  **Terminal Cash Flow (TCF)** = 2030 Cash Flow * (1 + Maturity Rate) / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
    TCF = 241.4 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02)
    TCF = 246.2 / 0.07 = **\$3,517.1 million**

2.  **NPV of Terminal Value** = TCF * Discount Factor (2030)
    NPV of Terminal Value = 3,517.1 * 0.596 = **\$2,096.1 million**

### D. Enterprise Value (EV)

| Metric | Amount (\$MM) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030) | 815.8 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | 2,096.1 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (EV)** | **2,911.9** |

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

The final fair value is calculated using the EV method, adjusted for current Cash and Debt.

| Metric | Amount (\$MM) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Enterprise Value | 2,911.9 |
| **ADD:** Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | + 1,110.6 |
| **SUBTRACT:** Total Debt | - 1,445.1 |
| **Equity Value** | **2,577.4** |
| Shares Outstanding (Millions) | 166.8 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$15.45** |

## V. Justification and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **\$15.45** |
| **Current Market Price** (Approx.) | **\$20.36** |
| **Difference** | **-24.1%** |

### Justification for the Difference

The calculated Fair Value of **\$15.45** is approximately 24.1% lower than the Current Market Price of **\$20.36**. The market's valuation is making significantly more optimistic assumptions than the conservative DCF model.

**Reasons why the market value is higher (Market's Assumptions):**

1.  **Faster, Higher Growth in High-Margin Segments:** The market is likely pricing in a much faster growth rate for the high-margin **Spark** clear aligner and **Digital Imaging** businesses post-2025. My projection uses a conservative long-term growth rate, decelerating from $4.0\%$ to $1.8\%$. The market may believe growth will stabilize closer to $4.0\%$ or $5.0\%$ for an extended period, reflecting a successful market share capture from competitors like Align Technology.
2.  **More Aggressive Margin Expansion:** My model projects a Net Income Margin of $6.5\%$ by 2028. The market is likely assuming that the full benefits of **Spark's profitability** and the **Envista Business System (EBS)** will drive the Net Income Margin to $\mathbf{8\%}$ or higher, closer to industry-leading peers, on a faster timeline.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate / Higher Terminal Rate:** The market may view Envista as a lower-risk entity than my $9.0\%$ discount rate suggests, or may be applying a more aggressive long-term maturity rate (e.g., $3.0\%$ or $3.5\%$ instead of $2.0\%$).
4.  **ROIC on Cash:** The instruction-mandated low ROIC on cash (5.0%) is highly conservative. If the company were to deploy its substantial cash balance ($\$1.11$ billion) into high-ROIC M\&A (acquisitions), the total cash flow would be significantly higher, which the market might anticipate.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated Fair Value of $\mathbf{\$15.45}$ is based on a **conservative** model that strictly adheres to management's near-term guidance for profitability and a stable, low-to-mid-single-digit long-term growth rate for the mature dental industry. The $\mathbf{\$4.91}$ difference per share suggests the market is pricing in the *success* of the company's turnaround initiatives (Spark profitability, EBS efficiency) and is anticipating **higher sustained long-term revenue growth** and **greater margin leverage** than the conservative projections assume.
