### 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projection Justification (2026-2030)

The revenue projection is built on the foundation of Envista's strategy, known as the **Envista Business System (EBS)**, which focuses on: 1) **Growth** (via share gains and innovation), 2) **Operations** (via productivity and efficiency), and 3) **People**.

*   **Core Growth Driver:** The primary engine is the growth of its premium businesses, specifically **Spark Clear Aligners** and **Implant-Based Tooth Replacement (Nobel Biocare)**. Spark achieved positive operating profit in Q3 2025 and is consistently reporting double-digit growth, with management investing heavily in R&D and new products (e.g., Spark Jr., DTX Studio Clinic) [cite: 12 from step 2]. This aggressive investment and market capture in higher-margin segments justify a growth rate above the general dental market.
*   **Management Guidance & Conservatism:** Management's medium-term outlook targets core growth of **2% to 4%** [cite: 12 from step 2]. The 2026 guidance is explicitly 2%-4% core sales growth [cite: 9 from step 2]. Given global macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical risks (e.g., Value-Based Procurement in China, tariff headwinds) [cite: 9 from step 2], the following rates are chosen to be **conservative** and reflect a gradual moderation to a stable market growth:
    *   **2026:** Starts at the top end of the 2-4% core growth guidance to capture the momentum from Q4 2025, but conservatively rounded down to **3.0%**.
    *   **2027 - 2030:** A conservative annual step-down model is used, reflecting a return to the general dental market growth rate and a stable, mature company profile.

| Year | Revenue Calculation (in millions USD) | Projected Revenue | Core Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | N/A | $2,719.0 | N/A |
| **2026 (Projection)** | $2,719.0 * (1 + 3.0%) | $2,800.6 | 3.0% |
| **2027 (Projection)** | $2,800.6 * (1 + 2.5%) | $2,870.6 | 2.5% |
| **2028 (Projection)** | $2,870.6 * (1 + 2.0%) | $2,927.9 | 2.0% |
| **2029 (Projection)** | $2,927.9 * (1 + 1.5%) | $2,971.8 | 1.5% |
| **2030 (Projection)** | $2,971.8 * (1 + 1.5%) | $3,016.4 | 1.5% |

### 3. Net Income and ROIC Projection Justification

**Net Income (NI) Margin:**

*   **FY 2025 GAAP NI Margin:** $47.0M / $2,719.0M = **1.73%**. This is very low due to significant non-cash and one-time charges in recent years (e.g., goodwill impairment, tax charges) [cite: 10 from step 3].
*   **Projection Justification:** Management is guiding to a long-term improvement driven by operational excellence (EBS) and a shift toward higher-margin products (Spark). The company reported a much higher **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 13.7%** in 2025. Using the Adjusted figures would ignore the recurring nature of some GAAP adjustments (like amortization of intangibles). Therefore, a **conservative increase in the GAAP Net Income Margin** is projected, reflecting the company's successful turnaround and focus on profitability (Spark turning profitable, etc.) while assuming non-cash charges will normalize but not disappear. I will project the GAAP Net Income Margin to gradually climb to a **conservative long-term target of 4.0%** by 2028.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**

*   Given the volatility of historical GAAP Net Income, calculating a historical ROIC is unreliable. The rule mandates using a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC. Envista's management highlights strong **Free Cash Flow conversion of ~100%** [cite: 9 from step 2], indicating the company has cash to reinvest.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** A **5.0% ROIC** is applied to the prior year's retained Net Income (cash on hand) to reflect the reasonable, conservative return the company can generate by continually reinvesting its cash flow back into its high-growth businesses (R&D, tuck-in acquisitions) as per its strategy.

| Year | Projected Revenue (A) | Projected NI Margin | Projected NI (B) | Prior NI Carried (C) | ROIC (5.0%) on C (D) | Final NI (B + D) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | $2,719.0 | 1.73% | $47.0 | N/A | N/A | $47.0 |
| **2026** | $2,800.6 | 2.50% | $70.0 | $47.0 | $2.4 | **$72.4** |
| **2027** | $2,870.6 | 3.25% | $93.3 | $119.4 | $6.0 | **$99.3** |
| **2028** | $2,927.9 | 4.00% | $117.1 | $218.7 | $10.9 | **$128.0** |
| **2029** | $2,971.8 | 4.00% | $118.9 | $346.7 | $17.3 | **$136.2** |
| **2030** | $3,016.4 | 4.00% | $120.7 | $482.9 | $24.1 | **$144.8** |
| **Terminal** | | | | | | |

*Note: Prior NI Carried is the sum of all Final NI from previous years (e.g., 2027: $47.0 + $72.4 = $119.4).*

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income for each year is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is common for stable, profitable companies, and is supported by management's guidance of $\sim 100\%$ Free Cash Flow conversion [cite: 9 from step 2].

| Assumption | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC Proxy)** | **9.0%** | Conservative rate for a global medical technology company with moderate debt and historical earnings volatility. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | **2.0%** | Very conservative maturity rate, reflecting long-term stable GDP-like growth for a large, established dental company. |

#### **A. Present Value of Projected Cash Flows (2026-2030)**

| Year | Final NI (FCF) (A) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | $72.4 | 0.9174 | $66.4 |
| **2027** | $99.3 | 0.8417 | $83.6 |
| **2028** | $128.0 | 0.7722 | $98.8 |
| **2029** | $136.2 | 0.7084 | $96.5 |
| **2030** | $144.8 | 0.6499 | $94.1 |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030)** | | | **$439.4** |

#### **B. Terminal Value Calculation**

The Terminal Value (TV) is the present value of all cash flows after 2030, calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Model:

Terminal Cash Flow = Projected NI for 2030 = $144.8 million
Terminal Value in 2030 = Terminal Cash Flow * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Growth Rate)
Terminal Value in 2030 = $144.8 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.09 - 0.02)
Terminal Value in 2030 = $147.7 / 0.07 = **$2,110.0 million**

#### **C. Present Value of Terminal Value**

NPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value in 2030 * Discount Factor for 2030
NPV of Terminal Value = $2,110.0 * 0.6499 = **$1,371.3 million**

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Cash Flows (2026-2030)** | $439.4 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value (Post-2030)** | $1,371.3 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **$1,810.7** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $1,211.7 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | $1,448.3 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **$1,574.1** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 163.8 |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Total Equity Value / Shares)** | **$9.61** |

### Fair Value Conclusion and Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $9.61**

**Current Stock Price (approx.): $24.81**

The calculated fair value of **$9.61** is significantly lower than the current market price of **$24.81**.

#### Justification for the Difference

The market is making a fundamentally different set of assumptions about Envista's future profitability compared to this conservative, GAAP-Net-Income-based DCF.

**Market's Implied Assumptions (Justification for the higher market price):**

1.  **Sustained, High Margin:** The market is likely valuing Envista on its **Adjusted EBITDA** and **Adjusted EPS** metrics, which show a much healthier profitability trend (FY 2025 Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 13.7% and guided 7%-10% Adjusted EPS growth [cite: 12 from step 2]). The market is assuming that the large, recurring non-cash charges (like amortization of intangibles from Danaher's spin-off, goodwill/intangible asset impairments) will **not continue indefinitely** at the same rate, or that they are not relevant to true operating cash flow.
2.  **Higher Terminal Growth/Value:** The market is assuming a much higher terminal value, likely based on a combination of:
    *   **Higher Long-Term Core Growth:** An implicit core growth rate significantly higher than the conservative 1.5% used in the terminal period. The market may believe the Spark clear aligner business, with its double-digit growth, will become a much larger component of the revenue mix, pulling the entire growth rate up closer to the 4-6% range long-term.
    *   **Higher Long-Term Margin:** The market is projecting a Net Income Margin closer to the historical **Operating Margin for its two segments (17.0% for Equipment & Consumables)** [cite: 5 from step 3], as the new management's EBS drive reduces SG&A and COGS significantly.

**Conclusion:**

The DCF model presented is constrained by the requirement to use a low and volatile historical **GAAP Net Income** (1.73% margin in 2025) as the starting point, leading to a much lower fair value. The market is effectively ignoring the GAAP-based historical one-time/non-cash charges and choosing to price the company based on **management's adjusted guidance and the operational success** of the high-growth segments (Spark), believing a higher, more stable profitability (closer to 13%+ Adjusted EBITDA Margin) will persist and grow faster than projected here. The conservative assumptions in this DCF model ($9.61) intentionally fail to incorporate the successful execution of management's "Value Creation Plan" to fully realize the $24.81 market price.
