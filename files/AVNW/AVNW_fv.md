### B. Business Engine and Growth Assumptions

Aviat Networks' core business is providing wireless transport and access solutions, primarily for mobile network operators (MNOs) and private networks (e.g., utilities, public safety). The business engine is driven by:

1.  **5G Backhaul/Midhaul Investments:** Global service providers upgrading their infrastructure for 5G, with Aviat offering differentiated products like the WTM 4000 platform.
2.  **Private Networks:** Strong growth, particularly in North America, driven by utility and public safety sectors.
3.  **Acquisitions (M&A):** Integration of acquisitions like Redline (mission-critical data infrastructure) and 4RF (industrial wireless access) to expand product offerings into Private LTE/5G.
4.  **Vendor-Agnostic Software:** Solutions like Frequency Assurance Software (FAS) which works on third-party radios, enabling penetration into new accounts (e.g., Airtel India). This lowers the cost of switching and broadens the addressable market.

**Management Guidance and Projections:**

The management provides concrete guidance for the next fiscal year (FY2026), which forms the foundation of the revenue model.

*   **FY 2026 Revenue Guidance:** \$440 million to \$460 million. I will use the **mid-point of \$450 million** as the conservative base for FY2026.
*   **FY 2026 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance:** \$45 million to \$55 million. I will use the **mid-point of \$50 million** for margin projections.
*   **Backlog:** \$323 million as of end of FY2025, an 11% increase, which signals continued demand and supports the near-term revenue forecast.

**Revenue Projection Engine (FY 2025 - FY 2030):**

| Fiscal Year (FYE June) | Revenue Assumption / Justification | Projected Revenue (\$M) | YoY Growth (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | Base year. | \$434.6 | 6.5% |
| **2026 (Estimate)** | **Conservative Mid-Point of Management Guidance** (\$440M - \$460M). | \$450.0 | 3.5% |
| **2027 (Estimate)** | **Conservative Growth:** Continued MNO and private network investment, but slower adoption. 50% of the prior year's growth. | \$465.8 | 3.5% |
| **2028 (Estimate)** | **Further Deceleration:** Continued modest growth from installed base and minimal market share gains. | \$479.7 | 3.0% |
| **2029 (Estimate)** | **Sustained Growth:** Maturing growth in core markets, approaching long-term industry growth rates. | \$491.7 | 2.5% |
| **2030 (Estimate)** | **Maturity Rate:** Moving towards the conservative perpetual growth rate (terminal growth). | \$501.5 | 2.0% |

## 2. Margin and Net Income Projections

### A. Margin Assumptions

| Metric | FY 2025 Actual | FY 2026 Justification | Projection (FY 2026-2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Margin (GAAP)** | 32.1% | Lower than prior years (35.5% in FY2024) due to project mix. I assume a conservative, slight recovery, avoiding the higher non-GAAP margin of 34.7% seen in Q4. | **33.0%** (Conservative, slight improvement due to operational efficiency and software/services mix). |
| **Operating Margin (GAAP)** | 2.4% (\$10.6M/\$434.6M) | FY2026 Adj. EBITDA Mid-Point is \$50M on \$450M Revenue, implying 11.1% margin. Adj. EBITDA is higher than Operating Income. FY2026 Operating Margin is estimated by using a conservative estimate of the Adj. EBITDA margin, net of estimated D&A. | **5.5%** (Conservative uplift, benefiting from operational leverage on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses from Q4 FY2025 trend). |
| **Tax Rate** | 0.0% | The company has over **\$450 million of Net Operating Losses (NOLs)** which are expected to result in minimal cash tax payments for the foreseeable future. The model assumes a 0% tax rate through 2030. |
| **Net Income Margin** | 0.3% (\$1.3M/\$434.6M) | Net Income margin is assumed to equal the operating margin for this model, as there are minimal/no income taxes due to NOLs, and assuming negligible interest/other expenses for a conservative FCF proxy. | **5.5%** |

### B. ROIC Assumption

The rule states: "If past ROIC is negative but you are projecting positive net income, just get a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC %."

*   **ROIC Selection:** Given the company's focus on high-growth segments (5G, Private Networks, M&A) and demonstrated ability to generate positive returns recently, a conservative, but positive, reinvestment return is appropriate.
*   **ROIC (Conservative):** **6.0%**. This is a reasonable assumption, slightly above a conservative long-term government bond yield, reflecting a moderate-risk return on reinvested capital.

### C. Projected Net Income (Cash Flow Proxy)

The Net Income is calculated using the formula:
$$\text{Net Income}_{n} = (\text{Revenue}_{n} * \text{Net Income Margin}) + (\text{Net Income}_{n-1} * \text{ROIC})$$
Net Income from the prior year is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year, which then generates additional income via ROIC.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (\$M) | Net Income Margin | Net Income from Operations (\$M) | Income from ROIC (\$M) | Total Net Income (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Actual)** | \$434.6 | N/A | \$1.3 | N/A | \$1.3 |
| **2026** | \$450.0 | 5.5% | \$24.75 | (\$1.3 * 6.0%) = \$0.08 | **\$24.83** |
| **2027** | \$465.8 | 5.5% | \$25.62 | (\$24.83 * 6.0%) = \$1.49 | **\$27.11** |
| **2028** | \$479.7 | 5.5% | \$26.38 | (\$27.11 * 6.0%) = \$1.63 | **\$28.01** |
| **2029** | \$491.7 | 5.5% | \$27.04 | (\$28.01 * 6.0%) = \$1.68 | **\$28.72** |
| **2030** | \$501.5 | 5.5% | \$27.58 | (\$28.72 * 6.0%) = \$1.72 | **\$29.30** |

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Rates

*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g):** **1.0%** (A very conservative perpetual growth rate, well below global GDP growth, accounting for long-term slowdown and market saturation/competition).
*   **Conservative Discount Rate (r):** **10.0%** (A reasonable rate for a growth-oriented, micro-cap technology company, serving as a conservative proxy for the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)).

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The Net Income projection is used as a proxy for Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF), which is then discounted back to the present.

| Fiscal Year (n) | Projected Net Income (\$M) | Discount Factor (1/(1+10%)^n) | Present Value (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | \$24.83 | 0.909 | \$22.57 |
| **2027** | \$27.11 | 0.826 | \$22.40 |
| **2028** | \$28.01 | 0.751 | \$21.04 |
| **2029** | \$28.72 | 0.683 | \$19.63 |
| **2030** | \$29.30 | 0.621 | \$18.20 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026-2030)** | | | **\$103.84** |

### C. Terminal Value (TV)

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows beyond 2030. The Gordon Growth Model is used:

$$\text{TV} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} * (1 + g)}{r - g}$$
$$\text{TV} = \frac{\$29.30 * (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01} = \frac{\$29.593}{0.09} = \$328.81 \text{ Million}$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value (PV of TV):**
$$\text{PV of TV} = \text{TV} * \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$
$$\text{PV of TV} = \$328.81 \text{ Million} * 0.621 = **\$204.29 \text{ Million}**$$

### D. Total Equity Value

| Component | Value (\$M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2026-2030)** | \$103.84 |
| **PV of Terminal Value (Post-2030)** | \$204.29 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | \$308.13 |
| **Plus: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$59.70 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | (\$87.60) |
| **Implied Equity Value** | **\$280.23** |

## 4. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value Per Share

$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\text{Implied Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$
$$\text{Fair Value Per Share} = \frac{\$280.23 \text{ Million}}{12.89 \text{ Million Shares}} = \text{\$21.74}$$

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$21.74** |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$24.63** |
| **Difference** | **-11.73%** |

### B. Justification of Difference

My calculated Fair Value of **\$21.74** is about 11.7% lower than the current market price of **\$24.63**. This suggests the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future growth and/or profitability than my conservative model.

**Analysis of Market vs. Conservative Assumptions:**

| Valuation Input | My Conservative Assumption | Market's Implied Assumption | Justification for Market's View |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Post-2026)** | Decelerating from 3.5% to 2.0% (FY2030) | Likely higher, perhaps **5-7%** annually in the mid-to-long term. | The market likely places a higher value on the 5G and Private Network opportunity, assuming AVNW will capture significant market share with its differentiated products and vendor-agnostic solutions. |
| **Net Income Margin** | Conservative **5.5%** | Likely higher, perhaps **7-9%**. | The market may be projecting better operational leverage and a richer product mix (higher-margin software/services from acquisitions and new product rollouts) than my conservative 5.5% margin. |
| **ROIC / Cash Reinvestment** | Conservative **6.0%** | Higher, perhaps **8-10%**. | A higher assumed return on reinvested capital would significantly boost future cash flows in the model, reflecting an expectation that AVNW's M&A strategy will generate superior returns. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | Very conservative **1.0%** | Higher, perhaps **2.0-2.5%** (in line with inflation/GDP). | A higher terminal growth rate is a common market assumption for a company with exposure to the growing global data/telecom infrastructure market. |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | Conservative **10.0%** | Lower, perhaps **8-9%**. | The market may view AVNW as a less risky investment, justifying a lower WACC/Discount Rate, which dramatically increases the NPV of all future cash flows. |

**Conclusion:**

My valuation is a **conservative estimate** designed to adhere strictly to the rules of using minimal growth and profitability assumptions, backed only by confirmed management guidance and a conservative interpretation of the business engine. The market is not "wrong," but rather pricing in a more optimistic scenario. Specifically, the market is likely factoring in:

1.  A better long-term operating margin due to successful integration of high-margin acquisitions (Redline, 4RF) and a higher software/services mix.
2.  Stronger mid-term revenue growth driven by sustained multi-year cycles in 5G and utility/public safety private networks.
3.  A more robust Terminal Value driven by a higher growth rate and/or a lower discount rate.

To match the current market price, the model would need to assume a $\text{WACC}$ in the range of 8.5% and a higher long-term growth rate, or significantly higher operating margins, which my conservative approach avoids. **Therefore, I stand by the Fair Value of \$21.74, suggesting the stock is trading at a slight premium to a conservatively-modeled intrinsic value.**
