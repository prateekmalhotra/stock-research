### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (FY2026 - FY2030)

Aviat Networks is a specialist in wireless transport and access solutions, serving telecommunications operators and private network providers (e.g., utilities, government). The business engine is driven by:

1.  **5G/Mobile Network Upgrades:** Mobile operators continue to require backhaul infrastructure to support 5G rollout, though the timing can be lumpy (mentioned in Q2 2026 transcript).
2.  **Private Networks:** Strong growth, particularly in North America, driven by utility and public safety communications networks.
3.  **Geographic Expansion & Market Penetration:** Acquisitions (e.g., 4RF and Nexus) and organic growth in high-growth international regions (Africa, Middle East, Europe) are key drivers.
4.  **Backlog:** A strong backlog of \$323 million at the end of FY2025 provides visibility and a solid foundation for FY2026 execution.

Management provided **Fiscal Year 2026 guidance of \$440 to \$460 million** in revenue.

| Fiscal Year (FYE June) | Revenue (USD Millions) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Actual)** | \$434.6 | Reported revenue |
| **FY2026 (Projection)** | \$450.0 | Mid-point of management's guidance of \$440M to \$460M |
| **FY2027 (Projection)** | \$486.0 | Conservative 8.0% growth, reflecting continued execution on the \$323M backlog and initial post-acquisition synergy benefits. |
| **FY2028 (Projection)** | \$510.3 | Growth steps down to a conservative 5.0%, reflecting the mature telecom equipment market but still benefiting from private network and 5G backhaul demand. |
| **FY2029 (Projection)** | \$525.6 | Growth steps down to 3.0%, anticipating further market maturity and increased competition from larger players. |
| **FY2030 (Projection)** | \$536.1 | Growth steps down to a conservative 2.0%. |

### 3. Margin Projections and Net Income

The projection uses the highest actual **GAAP Gross Margin** from the search snippets and keeps margins stable/conservative, in line with management's guidance for improvement. Operating Expenses (OpEx) are stabilized as a percentage of revenue, representing disciplined operating model comments from management.

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 (Projection) | FY2028 (Projection) | FY2029 (Projection) | FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | \$434.6 | \$450.0 | \$486.0 | \$510.3 | \$525.6 | \$536.1 |
| **Gross Margin % (GAAP)** | 32.1% | 34.0% | 34.5% | 35.0% | 35.0% | 35.0% |
| **Gross Profit** | \$139.5 | \$153.0 | \$167.7 | \$178.6 | \$183.9 | \$187.6 |
| **OpEx %** | 29.7% | 29.0% | 28.5% | 28.0% | 28.0% | 28.0% |
| **Operating Income (EBIT)** | \$10.6 | \$22.5 | \$29.4 | \$35.7 | \$36.7 | \$37.5 |
| **Net Income % (GAAP)** | 0.3% | 3.0% | 4.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| **Tax Rate** | N/A | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% |
| **Net Income (Initial)** | \$1.3 | \$13.5 | \$19.4 | \$25.5 | \$26.3 | \$26.8 |

**Justification for Margins:**
*   Management's strategy is to improve gross margins to the **"mid-30% range"** (34-36%). A conservative path of 34.0% to 35.0% is used.
*   The Net Income % is increased aggressively in the initial years (from 0.3% to 5.0% by FY2028), reflecting the shift from historical unprofitability/low profitability to sustained profitability guided by management's commentary on operational discipline and growing EBITDA.

### 4. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Projection

Aviat has struggled with profitability historically, reporting GAAP Net Income of only \$1.3 million in FY2025. Therefore, calculating a meaningful historical ROIC is difficult and likely misleading.

*   **Assumption:** A conservative, stable **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)** of **6.0%** is used. This is a reasonable positive return for a profitable, growing industrial technology company, and is conservative relative to high-growth tech companies.
*   **Methodology:** Net Income for the next year includes income from the current year's cash balance (as per prompt rules).

$$
\text{Net Income}_n = \text{Net Income from Operations}_n + (\text{Cumulative Cash from Previous Year}_n \times \text{ROIC})
$$

| Fiscal Year | Net Income (Initial) | Cumulative Cash (Previous Year) | ROIC (6.0%) | ROIC Income | Net Income (Final) | Cumulative Cash (End of Year) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025** | \$1.3 (Actual) | N/A | N/A | N/A | \$1.3 | \$86.5 + \$1.3 = **\$87.8** |
| **FY2026** | \$13.5 | \$87.8 | 6.0% | \$5.3 | \$18.8 | \$87.8 + \$18.8 = **\$106.6** |
| **FY2027** | \$19.4 | \$106.6 | 6.0% | \$6.4 | \$25.8 | \$106.6 + \$25.8 = **\$132.4** |
| **FY2028** | \$25.5 | \$132.4 | 6.0% | \$8.0 | \$33.5 | \$132.4 + \$33.5 = **\$165.9** |
| **FY2029** | \$26.3 | \$165.9 | 6.0% | \$10.0 | \$36.3 | \$165.9 + \$36.3 = **\$202.2** |
| **FY2030** | \$26.8 | \$202.2 | 6.0% | \$12.1 | **\$38.9** | \$202.2 + \$38.9 = **\$241.1** |

### 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%**. This is a conservative yet reasonable rate, above the typical market return, reflecting the small-cap status and cyclicality of the telecom equipment industry.
*   **Terminal/Maturity Rate (Long-Term Growth):** **2.0%**. This is a very conservative rate, in line with long-term inflation and below historical GDP growth, assuming market saturation after the 5G and private network build-outs.

**Terminal Value (TV) Calculation:**
Terminal Net Income (FY2030) = \$38.9 million
Terminal Value = (Cash Flow $\times$ (1 + Terminal Rate)) / (Discount Rate - Terminal Rate)
$$
\text{TV} = \frac{\$38.9 \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.10 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$39.7}{\$0.08} = \$496.25 \text{ million}
$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation:**

| Fiscal Year (n) | Net Income (Final) $\text{CF}_n$ | Discount Factor (1/1.10)^n | NPV of $\text{CF}_n$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026 (n=1)** | \$18.8 | 0.909 | \$17.1 |
| **FY2027 (n=2)** | \$25.8 | 0.826 | \$21.3 |
| **FY2028 (n=3)** | \$33.5 | 0.751 | \$25.2 |
| **FY2029 (n=4)** | \$36.3 | 0.683 | \$24.8 |
| **FY2030 (n=5)** | \$38.9 | 0.621 | \$24.1 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | \$496.25 | 0.621 | \$308.2 |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flows** | | | **\$420.7 million** |

### 6. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$420.7 |
| **Add: Current Cash & Equivalents** | \$86.5 |
| **Subtract: Total Debt** | -\$105.4 |
| **Total Equity Value (Fair Value)** | **\$401.8 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 12.837 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$31.30** |

### Fair Value and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **\$31.30** |
| **Current Market Price Per Share** | **\$26.36** |

**Justification for the Difference:**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$31.30** suggests that Aviat Networks is undervalued by the market compared to this DCF model, which is a premium of approximately 19% over the current market price of \$26.36.

The primary reason for this difference is the market making a **more conservative assumption on future profitability and/or growth** than the model, specifically:

1.  **Risk of Integration and Execution on Guidance:** The market may be skeptical that Aviat can achieve the sustained Net Income margins (5.0%) and ROIC (6.0%) used in the model. The historical GAAP Net Income of \$1.3 million in FY2025 is very low, and past unprofitability weighs on investor confidence. The market is likely pricing in a higher risk/discount rate or lower long-term terminal growth than the conservative assumptions used here.
2.  **Lumpy Revenue and Project Delays:** The telecom equipment market is project-driven, leading to lumpy revenue, as noted in the earnings calls (e.g., timing of mobile network projects). This volatility increases perceived risk, leading to a lower market valuation multiple than a stable growth company.
3.  **Competition from Giants:** The company competes against "large mobile and IP network infrastructure manufacturers such as Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, Nokia Corporation and GE Vernova". This creates a perpetual risk of pricing pressure or market share loss, which a market multiple (like the current P/E of ~23.31) discounts.

**Conclusion:**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$31.30 per share** is based on reasonable, conservative growth assumptions (2.0%-8.0% revenue growth) and management's own guidance on improving margins (mid-30% gross margin) and operational efficiency. The market is likely discounting the stock due to a higher perceived risk of execution on the profitability and growth targets, making the calculated fair value a reflection of the company's potential if it successfully executes on its strategy and continues the profitable growth trajectory implied by its recent performance and backlog.
