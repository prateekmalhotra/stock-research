## **B. Business Engine and Revenue Projection**

Aviat Networks' core business driver is the demand for wireless transport solutions, which is split between mobile network operators (MNOs) and the higher-margin **private networks** segment (government, utility, defense).

The business engine is driven by:
1.  **Private Network Growth:** Management has consistently highlighted growth in this segment, including record North American private network bookings and new market verticals (e.g., PISA LTE 5G router). This provides a stable, high-margin revenue stream.
2.  **Backlog and Book-to-Bill:** The consistently above-one book-to-bill ratio (trailing twelve months and consecutive quarters) and the \$323 million backlog (end of FY2025) signal sustained demand and a solid foundation for future revenue, setting the stage for growth in FY2026 and beyond.
3.  **Acquisition Integration:** Recent acquisitions (Pasolink in FY2024, 4RF in FY2025) are expected to be accretive and contribute to international and private network growth, but the primary impact is short-term.

### **Revenue Projections (Fiscal Year Ends in June)**

The projection is based on a conservative deceleration of growth, starting with the management's FY2026 guidance and scaling down, reflecting a mature, cyclical telecommunications equipment market where MNO capital expenditure can be volatile, despite strong private network growth.

| Fiscal Year (FYE June) | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Guidance Midpoint) | FY2027 (Estimate) | FY2028 (Estimate) | FY2029 (Estimate) | FY2030 (Estimate) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Revenue (M)** | \$434.6 | **\$450.0** | **\$472.5** | **\$491.4** | **\$506.1** | **\$518.7** |
| **YoY Growth** | 6.5% | 3.5% | 5.0% | 4.0% | 3.0% | 2.5% |
| **Justification** | Actual | Management Guidance Midpoint (\$440-\$460M) | Conservative acceleration based on backlog, book-to-bill > 1, and new private network products. | Deceleration assumes MNO capex slows and private network penetration growth normalizes. | Further normalization to a growth rate slightly above long-term inflation. | Approaching terminal growth rate. |

## **C. Margin and Net Income Projections**

### **Margin Assumptions**

| Metric | FY2025 (Actual) | FY2026 (Projection) | FY2027 - FY2030 (Projection) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin (GAAP)** | 0.30% | 4.00% | 4.50% |
| **Justification** | FY2025 GAAP Net Income was \$1.3M on \$434.6M revenue. | The mid-point Adjusted EBITDA guidance is 11.1% (\$50M/\$450M). A 4.0% Net Income margin represents a *conservative* capture of this profitability, accounting for an expected normalization of D&A, interest, and taxes. | A gradual, conservative improvement to reflect operating leverage and management's focus on cost discipline and profitability. |

### **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption**

The trailing GAAP ROIC is low and volatile due to low GAAP Net Income. Since I am projecting future profitability, I will use a conservative, stable positive ROIC as instructed.

*   **Net Income as Cash:** The rule states net income goes straight into cash for the next year.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** I will use a **6.0%** ROIC.
    *   **Justification:** This is a conservative, but reasonable, positive rate. It reflects the expected return on the incremental cash accumulated from the projected Net Income, given the company's established, though capital-intensive, business in wireless transport.

### **Projected Net Income**

| Fiscal Year (FYE June) | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) (A * Margin) | Income from ROIC (C) (6.0% * Previous Year's Cash) | Total Net Income (B + C) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2025** | \$434.6 | 0.30% | \$1.3 | - | \$1.3 |
| **FY2026** | \$450.0 | 4.00% | \$18.0 | \$0.1 | **\$18.1** |
| **FY2027** | \$472.5 | 4.50% | \$21.3 | \$1.1 | **\$22.4** |
| **FY2028** | \$491.4 | 4.50% | \$22.1 | \$1.3 | **\$23.4** |
| **FY2029** | \$506.1 | 4.50% | \$22.8 | \$1.4 | **\$24.2** |
| **FY2030** | \$518.7 | 4.50% | \$23.3 | \$1.5 | **\$24.8** |

*(Note: Net Income from ROIC begins in FY2026, where the previous year's cash is the FY2025 Net Income. For FY2027, the previous year's cash is the Total Net Income from FY2026, and so on.)*

## **D. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

### **DCF Assumptions**

| Metric | Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **9.0%** | A conservative but reasonable rate for a company in a specialized technology and telecommunications sector with a history of profit volatility and significant debt. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate)** | **1.5%** | A very conservative rate, below the average long-term nominal GDP growth, reflecting the conservative nature of the valuation. |

### **Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Fiscal Year (FYE June) | Total Net Income (M) (Future Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (M) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **FY2026** | \$18.1 | $1 / (1.09)^{1}$ | \$16.61 |
| **FY2027** | \$22.4 | $1 / (1.09)^{2}$ | \$18.82 |
| **FY2028** | \$23.4 | $1 / (1.09)^{3}$ | \$18.06 |
| **FY2029** | \$24.2 | $1 / (1.09)^{4}$ | \$17.15 |
| **FY2030** | \$24.8 | $1 / (1.09)^{5}$ | \$16.12 |
| **Terminal Value (TV)** | \$518.7 * 4.5% * (1 + 1.5%) / (9.0% - 1.5%) = \$318.0M | $1 / (1.09)^{5}$ | \$20.67 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows** | - | - | **\$318.0** |

**Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (2026 - Terminal) = \$16.61 + \$18.82 + \$18.06 + \$17.15 + \$16.12 + \$206.94**

*   *Note: Terminal Value is calculated as:* FY2030 Net Income * (1 + Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)
    *   *Terminal Value = (\$23.3M * 4.5% / 4.5%) * (1 + 1.5%) / (9.0% - 1.5%) = \$318.0M*
    *   *Terminal Value NPV = \$318.0M / (1.09)^5 = \$206.94M*

## **E. Fair Value Calculation**

| Calculation Step | Value (M) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | \$318.0 |
| **PLUS: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | \$86.5 |
| **MINUS: Total Debt** | -\$105.4 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$299.1** |
| **DIVIDE BY: Shares Outstanding** | 12.902 M |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$23.18** |

---

## **F. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share: \$23.18**

The calculated Fair Value of **\$23.18** per share is lower than the current reference market price of approximately **\$25.78**.

### **Justification for the Difference (Market Assumptions vs. Model Assumptions)**

The market is making a more optimistic assumption about Aviat Networks' long-term profitability and/or growth rate than this conservative DCF model.

1.  **Market Assumes Higher Terminal Growth/Net Income Margin:** Our model assumes a steady-state Net Income Margin of 4.5% and a terminal growth rate of 1.5%. The market is likely pricing in a more successful transition to the higher-margin private network business, potentially leading to:
    *   **Higher Terminal Growth:** The market may be assuming a Terminal Growth Rate closer to 2.5% to 3.0%, reflecting sustained growth from the 5G and private network build-outs.
    *   **Higher Long-Term Net Income Margin:** A company with an Adjusted EBITDA margin in the double digits (guided at 11.1%) is usually expected to convert more of that to Net Income than the 4.5% we conservatively project. If the market assumed a Net Income Margin of 5.5% (still conservative for a tech company but more aligned with the EBITDA profile), the valuation would increase.

2.  **Market Assumes Lower Discount Rate (WACC):** Our conservative 9.0% WACC reflects the company's volatility and the inherent risk in the telecommunications equipment sector. If the market uses a lower WACC (e.g., 8.0%), reflecting confidence in management's execution and cash flow generation, the NPV (and thus the fair value) would be higher.

3.  **Conservative ROIC:** Our model applies a conservative 6.0% ROIC to retained cash. The market is likely anticipating a higher reinvestment return, or simply not factoring in the Net Income/ROIC structure, instead focusing on pure Free Cash Flow (FCF) which, given the company's strong Adjusted EBITDA guidance and focus on operational efficiency, would likely be higher than the conservative Net Income used in this valuation.

In conclusion, our conservative valuation indicates the stock is slightly overvalued by the market. This is primarily because our model prioritizes **conservative assumptions** as instructed, whereas the market is factoring in **successful management execution** of the high-margin, private network strategy and a **higher eventual conversion** of the guided Adjusted EBITDA into Net Income and Free Cash Flow.
