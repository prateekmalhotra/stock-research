## 1. Initial Financial Data

The core financial data is sourced from Cinemark's latest available SEC filings (Q2 2025 10-Q and FY 2024 10-K).

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Date | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $931.6 | June 30, 2025 | Q2 2025 10-Q |
| **Total Gross Debt** | $2,336.3 | June 30, 2025 | Q2 2025 10-Q (Current Portion of LTD: $466.0 + Long-Term Debt: $1,870.3) |
| **Shares Outstanding (Diluted)** | 149.1 | Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 | Q2 2025 10-Q (Diluted W.A.S.O) |
| **FY 2024 Total Revenue** | $3,049.5 | FY 2024 | FY 2024 10-K |
| **FY 2024 Net Income** | $313.0 | FY 2024 | FY 2024 10-K |
| **FY 2024 Total Patrons** | 201.1 | FY 2024 | FY 2024 10-K |

**Notes on Initial Data:**
*   **Total Debt:** The company has stated its intent to repay the $\$460$ million convertible notes (a large part of the current portion of long-term debt) with cash on hand, which would reduce the effective net debt, but for a conservative DCF, the total gross debt of **$2,336.3 million** is used as the liability to be subtracted from Enterprise Value.
*   **Shares Outstanding:** The most conservative denominator, the **149.1 million** diluted weighted average shares outstanding, is used to account for potential dilution from convertible instruments.

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (2025-2030)

The core business drivers for a theatrical exhibitor like Cinemark are **Attendance (Patrons)** and **Revenue Per Patron** (which comprises Ticket Price and Concession Per Cap).

### Business Engine Assumptions

Management commentary indicates optimism for a "blockbuster 2025 film slate" and an expected recovery to "90% of pre-pandemic volume."

**A. Attendance (Patrons in millions)**
| Year | Assumption | Calculation | Patrons (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | *Base Year* | *Reported* | 201.1 |
| **2025** | Near-full recovery | 220.0 (Conservative 9.4% increase from 2024, targeting low-end of management's "90% of pre-pandemic volume" objective) | 220.0 |
| **2026** | Stabilized recovery | 225.0 (2.3% increase) | 225.0 |
| **2027** | Long-term growth begins | 1.0% growth (Population/new theatres) | 227.3 |
| **2028** | Long-term growth | 1.0% growth | 229.5 |
| **2029** | Long-term growth | 1.0% growth | 231.8 |
| **2030** | Long-term growth | 1.0% growth | 234.1 |

**B. Revenue Per Patron (Pricing Power)**
The company has demonstrated consistent pricing power in both tickets and concessions due to "strategic pricing measures" and enhanced capabilities.

| Metric | 2024 Base | 2025-2030 Annual Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Worldwide Avg Ticket Price ($)** | $7.97 | **2.5%** (Conservative, above long-term inflation) |
| **Concession Per Cap ($)** | $5.96 | **3.0%** (Slightly higher due to high-margin premium food/beverage mix and merchandise sales) |
| **Other Revenue per Patron ($)** | $0.40\* | **2.0%** (To account for ancillary revenue like screen advertising, event cinema, online fees, etc.) |

*Note: Other Revenue = ($3,049.5M Total Revenue - $1,522.5M Admissions Revenue - $1,197.8M Concession Revenue) / 201.1M Patrons = ~$1.64 per patron. This is a very important part of the revenue stream. I will use 1.64 per patron and grow this by 2.0%. The previous calculations for ticket price and concession are based on worldwide patrons.*

### Revenue Projection Table (in millions)

| Year | Patrons (M) | Avg Ticket Price | Admissions Rev | Concession Per Cap | Concessions Rev | Other Rev per Patron | Other Revenue | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 201.1 | 7.97 | 1,602.8 | 5.96 | 1,197.8 | 1.24\* | 248.9 | **3,049.5** |
| **2025** | 220.0 | 8.17 | 1,798.8 | 6.14 | 1,351.4 | 1.27 | 279.4 | **3,429.6** |
| **2026** | 225.0 | 8.38 | 1,885.5 | 6.32 | 1,421.3 | 1.29 | 290.5 | **3,597.3** |
| **2027** | 227.3 | 8.59 | 1,952.1 | 6.51 | 1,480.6 | 1.32 | 300.9 | **3,733.6** |
| **2028** | 229.5 | 8.81 | 2,021.3 | 6.71 | 1,542.4 | 1.35 | 311.9 | **3,875.6** |
| **2029** | 231.8 | 9.03 | 2,093.0 | 6.91 | 1,606.8 | 1.38 | 323.4 | **4,023.2** |
| **2030** | 234.1 | 9.26 | 2,167.7 | 7.12 | 1,673.8 | 1.40 | 335.8 | **4,177.3** |

*\*Recalculated 2024 Other Rev per Patron: $248.9M / 201.1M = $1.24. This is a conservative calculation based on the difference, and will be grown by 2.0%.*

## 3. Margin Projection and Net Income

### Margin Assumptions

| Cost Category | 2024 Margin (Approx) | 2025-2030 Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Film Rental & Adv. Cost % of Admissions Revenue** | 57.7% | **58.0%** (Slightly conservative) | Reflects the high leverage of blockbuster titles and potential negotiation changes. |
| **Concession Cost % of Concessions Revenue** | 17.6% | **18.0%** (Stable, conservative) | Reflects the high gross margin business, with slight increase for inflation/merchandise mix. |
| **Net Income Margin (% of Total Revenue)** | 10.26% | Gradual increase to **12.0%** | Increased operating leverage due to significant attendance recovery on a relatively fixed cost base. The company's 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 19.4%; this projection is conservative. |

### Net Income Projection (in millions)

The rule states: *Net Income for next year = Net Income for that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from Net Income got from previous year.*

**ROIC Assumption:**
*   **ROIC %:** A conservative, yet positive, **3.0%** is assumed on the prior year's retained Net Income, as the company is now profitable.
*   **Net Income for Projection Year (NI_P):** Total Revenue \* Projected Net Income Margin

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | NI (projected) (B) | ROIC on Prior NI (C) | **Net Income (B) + (C)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | 3,049.5 | 10.26% | 313.0 | N/A | **313.0 (Base)** |
| **2025** | 3,429.6 | 10.50% | 360.1 | 313.0 \* 3.0% = 9.4 | **369.5** |
| **2026** | 3,597.3 | 11.00% | 395.7 | 369.5 \* 3.0% = 11.1 | **406.8** |
| **2027** | 3,733.6 | 12.00% | 448.0 | 406.8 \* 3.0% = 12.2 | **460.2** |
| **2028** | 3,875.6 | 12.00% | 465.1 | 460.2 \* 3.0% = 13.8 | **478.9** |
| **2029** | 4,023.2 | 12.00% | 482.8 | 478.9 \* 3.0% = 14.4 | **497.2** |
| **2030** | 4,177.3 | 12.00% | 501.3 | 497.2 \* 3.0% = 14.9 | **516.2** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

The projected Net Income is used as the proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF) to Equity.

### DCF Assumptions

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **10.0%** | Conservative but reasonable rate, reflecting the risk of the theatrical exhibition industry (content pipeline volatility, streaming competition) while acknowledging Cinemark's strong market position and recovery. |
| **Perpetual Growth Rate (g)** | **2.0%** | Conservative long-term maturity rate, below the projected US GDP growth, reflecting stable but slow terminal growth for a mature business. |

### NPV Calculation

| Year (t) | Projected Net Income (FCF) (A) | Discount Factor (1/(1+r)^t) | Present Value (A * Factor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | 369.5 | 0.9091 | 335.9 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | 406.8 | 0.8264 | 336.2 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | 460.2 | 0.7513 | 345.8 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | 478.9 | 0.6830 | 327.1 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | 497.2 | 0.6209 | 308.7 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | 516.2 | 0.5645 | 291.4 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period** | | | **1,945.1** |

### Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030)

Terminal Value (TV) = FCF * (1 + g) / (r - g)

*   FCF in 2030 (t=6) = $516.2 million
*   TV in 2030 = $516.2 \* (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = $526.5 / 0.08 = **$6,581.3 million**

### Terminal Value Net Present Value (TV_NPV)

*   TV_NPV = TV \* Discount Factor for t=6
*   TV_NPV = $6,581.3 million \* 0.5645 = **$3,715.3 million**

### Total Equity Value (Net Present Value)

**Total NPV** = NPV of Explicit Period + TV_NPV
**Total NPV** = $1,945.1 million + $3,715.3 million = **$5,660.4 million**

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Equity Value (NPV)** | $5,660.4 |
| **Less: Total Gross Debt** | $2,336.3 |
| **Add: Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $931.6 |
| **Implied Market Capitalization** | **$4,255.7** |
| **Divided By: Diluted Shares Outstanding (M)** | 149.1 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$28.54** |

## Conclusion and Justification

The calculated Fair Value of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (CNK) stock is **$28.54** per share.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **$28.54** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$26.74** |
| **Implied Upside** | **6.73%** |

### Market Implied Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions

The calculated Fair Value of **$28.54** is reasonably close to the current market price of **$26.74**, implying that the market's assumptions about the company's future are very similar to the conservative model built here.

**Why the valuation is slightly higher than the market price:**

1.  **Conservative Debt Treatment (Net Debt vs. Gross Debt):** The valuation conservatively subtracted the full **Gross Debt of $2,336.3 million** but used the most recent **Cash balance of $931.6 million**. The company's intention to use $\$460$ million of its cash to pay down debt maturing in August 2025 would leave it with a lower cash balance but a significantly lower debt load. If we were to use a *Pro-Forma* Net Debt calculation, the Fair Value would increase, but the model used a conservative direct subtraction of total liability.
    *   *Pro-Forma Check (for context):* $931.6M Cash - $460M Repayment = $471.6M Remaining Cash. $2,336.3M Debt - $460M Repayment = $1,876.3M Remaining Debt. Net Debt = $1,404.7M. This would increase the valuation significantly, but the model sticks to the required approach of subtracting Gross Debt and adding Cash.

2.  **Conservative Revenue/Attendance Recovery:** The revenue projection for 2025-2030, while based on management's optimistic "90% of pre-pandemic volume" goal, is modest in the long term, with only 1.0% annual growth from 2027 onwards. The market might be assigning a slightly lower probability to a sustained attendance recovery beyond the initial film slate rebound.

3.  **Positive ROIC Assumption:** The model assumes a modest but positive 3.0% ROIC on retained earnings. If the market assigns a longer tail of negative ROIC due to high-interest debt and capex requirements, the terminal value would be lower.

The small 6.73% implied upside suggests that Cinemark is **fairly valued** by the market based on its current recovery trajectory and management's guidance on revenue drivers and cost structure. The market is effectively pricing the company for a return to historical profitability, which is a reasonable expectation given its strong market position and the consistent increase in high-margin concession revenue per patron.
