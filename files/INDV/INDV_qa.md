## Business Summary

Indivior is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and selling medicines primarily for opioid use disorder, which is addiction to opioids. Their core business model centers on creating specialized, patented prescription drugs that are sold mainly in the United States, where the opioid crisis has created the largest demand and most robust market for treatment. Their customers are specialized clinics, hospitals, and doctors treating addiction patients, who are the end users. Historically, the company earned significant revenue from a daily dissolvable film called Suboxone. However, the business is now strategically moving its revenue base toward a newer, long-acting injectable drug called Sublocade. This shift is essential, as the new product is given monthly by a doctor, ensuring better patient adherence and providing revenue stability as the older product faces severe competition.

## Business Model Risk

The primary near-term risk for Indivior is the successful execution of the shift toward their new injectable drug, Sublocade. The company is heavily dependent on doctors adopting this treatment quickly and on securing favorable reimbursement from US insurance providers and government programs. If the uptake is slower than expected, their earnings will suffer immediately. The core long-term risk relates to generic competition. The business model depends on creating protected, patented drugs; however, this protection eventually expires, as was seen historically when generic versions of their former flagship product, Suboxone, flooded the market, causing a dramatic collapse in sales and significant financial harm to the company. This historical vulnerability means that they must continually innovate. Furthermore, because their business is heavily concentrated in the US market, any changes in US healthcare policy, specifically related to the funding and reimbursement rates for addiction treatments, pose a significant and unpredictable regulatory threat to future earnings and market position.

## Company History

Indivior PLC is a specialty pharmaceutical company with a singular focus on developing and marketing treatments for addiction and serious mental illnesses, specifically pioneering medicines for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history from its beginnings to the present day.

### **The Genesis: From Consumer Goods to Specialty Pharma**

1.  **A Division is Born (1994):** Indivior’s roots are not as a standalone pharmaceutical company, but as the **Buprenorphine division** within the vast consumer goods giant, Reckitt Benckiser (RB). This division developed an innovative treatment for opioid dependence.
2.  **The Flagship Product - Suboxone:** The division's primary product became **Suboxone** (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone), which was approved for treating opioid addiction and dependence. Unlike older treatments, Suboxone could be prescribed by trained doctors in an office setting, dramatically expanding access for patients.
3.  **The Spin-Off (2014):** Reckitt Benckiser made the strategic decision to spin off this specialized pharmaceuticals unit into an independent, publicly traded company called **Indivior PLC**. This move allowed the new company to focus entirely on addiction treatment and science, while RB could concentrate on its core consumer health and hygiene products.

### **The Founding Mission and Initial Tailwinds**

4.  **The Core Mission:** The company was founded with a dual purpose: to commercialize its existing life-changing treatments and to help **tackle the opioid crisis**, one of the most urgent public health emergencies of its time. Its vision was to transition Substance Use Disorder (SUD) from a global crisis into a recognized and treated chronic disease.
5.  **A Crucial Tailwind (The Opioid Crisis):** Paradoxically, the escalating severity of the opioid crisis in the U.S. and globally served as a significant *market tailwind* (a favorable trend). This public health crisis created an immense and growing need for accessible, evidence-based medication like Suboxone to help people overcome addiction.
6.  **Regulatory Tailwinds:** Early regulatory changes in the U.S., like the **Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000)**, were also crucial, as they enabled office-based physicians to treat opioid-dependent patients with their medication, moving treatment out of specialized clinics and into a more mainstream medical setting.

### **Major Headwinds and Problems Faced**

7.  **The Threat of Generic Competition:** The most significant business *headwind* (challenge) began when the original patents for Suboxone tablets expired. The company then focused on a newer, patent-protected version, **Suboxone Film** (a dissolvable strip). When cheaper, generic versions of the film eventually hit the U.S. market, Indivior’s revenue from its flagship product plummeted, causing a major financial crisis.
8.  **Massive Legal and Fraud Headwinds:** Indivior and its former parent company faced a years-long barrage of legal action, including criminal and civil investigations, for their past marketing practices of Suboxone.
9.  **Anti-Trust and False Marketing Settlements:** The most damaging actions stemmed from allegations that the company improperly engaged in a scheme to maintain its monopoly by trying to block cheaper generic competitors. Indivior ultimately settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and various states for hundreds of millions of dollars for making false statements about the film’s safety around children to promote its use over the tablet version, resulting in total resolutions related to Suboxone marketing exceeding $2 billion (including the former parent company's settlement). In 2020, Indivior Solutions pleaded guilty to a felony charge.

### **Innovative Solutions and Current Strategy**

10. **The Innovative Lifeline: Sublocade:** To combat the loss of market share to generics and resolve the controversy surrounding daily dosing, Indivior invested heavily in R&D and launched its second major innovative product, **Sublocade**, in 2017.
11. **A New Treatment Paradigm:** Sublocade is a **monthly injectable medicine** for opioid use disorder. This innovative, long-acting formulation means patients only need a single injection per month, which helps reduce the risk of misuse, abuse, or the need for a daily dose. This product became the new cornerstone of Indivior's business, helping the company recover financially.
12. **Continuing to Innovate:** The company continues to enhance its main product line by gaining regulatory approvals for changes like a **"rapid initiation protocol"** for Sublocade, which allows a patient to begin treatment much faster than before. This innovation addresses practical barriers and makes it easier for healthcare providers to start people on the treatment.
13. **Expansion and the Future:** Indivior is broadening its scope to treat other substance use disorders and serious mental illnesses, including treatments for cocaine and alcohol dependence. A notable development in this strategy was the acquisition of biopharmaceutical company Opiant.
14. **Geographic Shift (Present Day):** In a major organizational decision, the company began the process to move its primary stock exchange listing from the London Stock Exchange to the U.S. NASDAQ, aiming to complete the transition to a U.S. primary listing by June 2025.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Indivior PLC (INDV) is primarily based on the technological superiority and high barriers to entry surrounding its flagship long-acting injectable product, which acts as a replacement for its older, now-genericized blockbuster.

### Analysis of Indivior's Moat

#### 1. The Core Differentiator: Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) Technology
*   The company's primary moat today is its product **Sublocade** (buprenorphine extended-release injection), a complex, long-acting injectable for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).
*   Unlike daily pills or sublingual films (like their older product, Suboxone, which is now genericized), Sublocade is administered once a month by a healthcare professional.
*   This monthly format is a powerful differentiator because it drastically improves **patient adherence** (the doctor ensures the patient gets their dose) and virtually eliminates the risk of misuse or diversion (selling the drug on the street).

#### 2. Pricing Power and Market Position
*   **Special Position:** Indivior is positioned as a specialist leader in the OUD treatment market, an area of critical, growing social need. Their core business is focused entirely on this therapeutic area, allowing for deep expertise.
*   **Pricing Power:** Their pricing power is **high for the innovative LAI** product (Sublocade), which drives the majority of the company's revenue growth. Since Sublocade offers superior adherence and medical outcomes, it can command a premium price and secure favorable reimbursement from payers like insurance companies and government programs.
*   **Loss of Pricing Power:** Conversely, the pricing power for their legacy product, **Suboxone Film**, has been severely eroded, with revenue declining due to intense price competition from generic alternatives.

#### 3. Barriers to Displacement and Recurring Revenue
*   **Regulatory/Manufacturing Moat:** The formulation and manufacturing of long-acting injectable products are highly complex and difficult to replicate, creating a major barrier for new competitors with only capital.
*   **The REMS Program:** Sublocade is sold through a restricted distribution program called a REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) due to the risk of serious harm if the injection is administered improperly (intravenously). This regulatory oversight and required clinical setup makes the market harder for a generic competitor to enter quickly, even after the patent expires.
*   **Sticky and Recurring Customer Base:** The treatment model for Sublocade is inherently sticky; a patient is on a recurring monthly injection administered by a certified healthcare provider. This is a procedure-based, long-term contract between the provider and the patient/payer, which drives consistent, recurring revenue, unlike a one-time prescription.

#### 4. The Reason for Growth: Past and Present
*   **Past Reason for Growth (Suboxone):** Indivior’s growth into a major company was initially fueled by the first-mover advantage and the patent protection of **Suboxone Film**. This product represented an innovative, convenient, and relatively abuse-deterrent form of buprenorphine compared to the older tablets.
*   **The Great Challenge:** The loss of key patent battles led to the generic entry of Suboxone, causing a **"rapid and material loss of market share,"** which threatened the company's existence.
*   **Present/Future Moat:** The company executed a strategic pivot to survive this challenge, using the cash flow from the former Suboxone monopoly to invest heavily in the next-generation LAI technology, which is now the primary growth engine and new, more robust moat.

#### 5. R&D and Innovation Strategy
*   **Constant Innovation is Required:** Yes, Indivior must constantly innovate. The generic threat to Suboxone demonstrated that their original moat was temporary, emphasizing the need for a continuous R&D pipeline.
*   **Focused R&D:** The company invests heavily in research and development, focusing on new formulations like LAIs to enhance patient adherence and outcomes, as well as new drug candidates for OUD and other substance use disorders like Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).

#### 6. Network Effects and Other Advantages
*   **No Classic Network Effect:** The business does not benefit from a classic "network effect" (where the value to one user increases as more users join).
*   **High Switching Costs and Mindshare:** The business has high **switching costs** because transferring a patient from one long-acting, chronic treatment regimen to another is a significant clinical and administrative decision. Their long history and extensive involvement in policy, advocacy, and education around addiction treatment also gives them a critical **mindshare and reputation** within the specialist physician and organized health system communities.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on the analysis of recent news, financial results (Q2 2025, Q1 2025, FY 2024), and management commentary from earnings calls, the following are the key catalysts for Indivior PLC (INDV).

### Near-Term Catalysts (2025)

1.  **Increased Financial Guidance and SUBLOCADE Growth**
    *   The company recently raised its full-year 2025 financial guidance for both total net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year.
    *   The flagship product, **SUBLOCADE** (buprenorphine extended-release injection for opioid use disorder or OUD), is the primary growth engine, with U.S. net revenue growing and outperforming expectations.

2.  **Execution of "Generate Momentum" Strategy (Phase 1 of Action Agenda)**
    *   Management (CEO Joe Ciaffoni) is focused on implementing Phase 1 of the multi-year **Indivior Action Agenda**, called "Generate Momentum," throughout the second half of 2025.
    *   This phase is focused on increasing U.S. SUBLOCADE net revenue and simplifying the organization by cutting non-essential activities, including recent headcount reductions, which is expected to immediately realize bottom-line accretion.

3.  **Positive Impact of SUBLOCADE Label and Data Changes**
    *   The FDA-approved label changes for SUBLOCADE, which include a rapid initiation protocol and alternative injection sites, are expected to further improve the patient and physician experience and increase product uptake.
    *   New clinical data presented suggests that higher doses of SUBLOCADE may offer clinically significant benefits for patients with high levels of fentanyl use, targeting a currently underserved high-need patient population.

4.  **Simplified Corporate Structure and Index Inclusion**
    *   The completion of the cancellation of its secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange, maintaining its primary listing on **Nasdaq**, simplifies the corporate structure and aligns the company with its U.S. focus on SUBLOCADE.
    *   Inclusion in U.S. indexes like the Russell 2000® and 3000® may attract greater institutional investor interest.

### Long-Term Catalysts (2026 and Beyond)

1.  **Launch of "Accelerate" Strategy (Phase 2 of Action Agenda)**
    *   Management's strategy is to transition to Phase 2, "Accelerate," at the start of **2026**, which is intended to further strengthen cash flow and profitability at a rate that exceeds revenue growth.
    *   This acceleration is contingent on the successful completion of Phase 1 and is expected to position the company for significant operating leverage and durable cash generation.

2.  **Advancing Pipeline Assets for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)**
    *   Indivior's pipeline is refocused exclusively on two OUD assets: **INDV-6001** and **INDV-2000**.
    *   **INDV-6001**, a three-month long-acting buprenorphine injection, is currently in Phase 2 trials with the last patient visit expected in Q4 2025; positive results could set up a path for a next-generation OUD treatment.
    *   **INDV-2000**, a selective orexin-1 receptor antagonist, is also in Phase 2, representing a novel mechanism of action for OUD treatment, with an estimated last patient visit in H1 2026.

3.  **Potential for Business Development and Acquisitions**
    *   The third phase of the Indivior Action Agenda involves exploring acquisition expansion, potentially for commercial-stage assets, which would diversify its product portfolio beyond SUBLOCADE.
    *   Management is also exploring strategic alternatives for its non-U.S. business and the overdose reversal spray Opvee, which, if divested, could streamline operations, unlock cash, and narrow focus further on the lucrative U.S. market for SUBLOCADE.

---

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of Indivior PLC’s executive compensation and ownership structure from recent filings, the management incentive plan is designed with several features to align executive interests with shareholders, particularly for long-term performance.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis (Indivior PLC)**

#### **Insider Ownership and Alignment**

1.  **Low Current Insider Ownership:** The current total ownership by "Individual Insiders" (directors and executive officers) is relatively low, reported at approximately **0.528%** of the company. The new CEO's direct ownership is also low at **0.045%**. A higher percentage of direct ownership is generally preferred for direct alignment.

2.  **High Shareholding Requirement:** A strong compensating mechanism is the mandatory shareholding guideline for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), which is set at a very high hurdle of **600% of base salary**. This compels the CEO to build and maintain a significant personal investment in the company, strongly aligning their long-term wealth with the share price performance.

#### **Compensation Structure and Performance Metrics**

3.  **High "At-Risk" Compensation:** A large component of executive pay is variable (non-salary). For example, in 2024, the CEO's incentive-based pay component was over $5.2 million, compared to a base salary of about $2.25 million, meaning the majority of their total compensation is dependent on performance. This structure ensures executives are only significantly rewarded for achieving results.

4.  **Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is Shareholder-Focused:** The LTIP, which forms the largest portion of the variable pay, vests over a three-year period and is heavily weighted toward shareholder returns. The performance metrics for the 2024-2026 LTIP awards are largely based on **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, measured against both the FTSE 250 (50% weighting) and a peer group of the S&P 1500 Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index (50% weighting).

5.  **Strategic and Operational Metrics for Long-Term Value:** Other LTIP performance conditions are tied to strategic milestones, such as **US Sublocade market share** and **Long-acting Injectables category growth**. This ensures that the long-term focus is not only on stock price comparisons but also on the successful commercialization of key products, which directly drives company value.

6.  **Clawback and Recoupment Policies:** The company has an Executive Compensation Clawback Policy, which allows for the recovery of incentive-based compensation in the event of a financial restatement. Additionally, an Executive Financial Recoupment Program is in place to put up to two years of performance pay at risk of forfeiture for certain misconduct, reinforcing good governance and protecting shareholder capital.

### **Conclusion**

Indivior PLC's executive pay structure demonstrates a **strong incentive to act in the interest of shareholders**. While the immediate, absolute insider ownership is low, this weakness is substantially mitigated by the high **600% of base salary shareholding requirement** for the CEO. The overall compensation structure is heavily weighted toward **performance-based LTIPs** that use **Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR)** as the primary metric, directly linking executive reward to shareholder outperformance over a multi-year period. The existence of robust **clawback and recoupment policies** further safeguards shareholder interests against poor financial or ethical conduct.

## Long Thesis

Indivior's primary growth story is its successful pivot from its old, generic-facing drug (Suboxone) to its much superior, patented, once-a-month injectable treatment, Sublocade. Near-term, the case is strong because sales of Sublocade are dramatically exceeding expectations, leading to raised financial forecasts. New management is actively cutting operating costs and simplifying the business structure (moving its listing to the U.S.) to immediately improve profit margins. Long-term, the bull case depends on Sublocade fulfilling its potential to reach $1.5 billion in annual sales. This is achievable because the drug's long-acting format, administered monthly by a doctor, guarantees patient adherence and provides highly stable, recurring revenue—a robust moat against generic pills. Furthermore, the company is developing next-generation treatments, including a potential three-month injectable drug, ensuring Indivior remains the undisputed leader in the growing U.S. market for opioid addiction treatment.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The rapid patient and doctor adoption rate for Sublocade must continue without interruption. New management must successfully execute its commercial strategy and cost-cutting program to deliver promised profit gains. US insurance companies and government programs must continue to provide favorable reimbursement for Sublocade, allowing it to maintain premium pricing. Lastly, competitors must fail to quickly replicate or launch a similar complex, long-acting injectable drug, allowing Indivior to maintain its technological monopoly for the foreseeable future.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and faults in the long thesis, which relies on assumptions that are contradicted by recent company updates, competitive developments, and market dynamics.

## Critique of Indivior PLC (INDV) Long Thesis

### I. Flaws in the Near-Term Growth Story (Sublocade Sales & Financials)

1.  **Sales are NOT Dramatically Exceeding Expectations:** The company has, at points, been forced to reduce its full-year revenue outlook for Sublocade, citing increased competitive pressure and adverse "payor dynamics." This directly contradicts the thesis's claim of "dramatically exceeding expectations," indicating a significant headwind to growth.
2.  **Overall Revenue is Expected to Decline:** While Sublocade revenue is projected to grow, the company's total net revenue for 2025 is forecasted to decline, reflecting the accelerated generic erosion of the legacy Suboxone Film and the discontinuation of the schizophrenia drug Perseris. This shows the company's transition is causing a net contraction in top-line sales.
3.  **The Pivot is Costly and Not Immediately Margin-Boosting:** The "new management" cost-cutting program has included job cuts, the discontinuation of a commercial product (Perseris), and significant restructuring charges (up to $50 million) in the short-term. The full flow-through of the expected cost savings into profit is anticipated to begin in 2026, not as an immediate profit gain.

### II. Flaws in the Long-Term Moat and Monopoly

1.  **The "Technological Monopoly" is Broken:** The assumption that competitors will fail to replicate the long-acting injectable drug is incorrect. **Brixadi** (buprenorphine extended-release injection), a direct, FDA-approved long-acting buprenorphine competitor, is already on the market and offers an alternative weekly or monthly dosing schedule, challenging Sublocade's once-a-month exclusivity. Competitive pressure from this rival was cited as a reason for Sublocade's sales forecast reduction.
2.  **Pricing and Reimbursement Are Under Pressure:** The "favorable reimbursement" assumption is shaky, as "payor dynamics" are cited as a negative factor impacting sales forecasts. Additionally, a significant portion of the target population is covered by government programs (Medicare, Medicaid), which are explicitly excluded from the company’s copay assistance program, suggesting a barrier to full patient access and pricing flexibility.
3.  **Next-Generation Pipeline is Not a Major Focus:** While the thesis highlights a pipeline, company commentary suggests management "doesn't see itself as a pipeline story," despite having two assets in Phase II development for OUD. This reduces the confidence that future novel treatments will ensure Indivior remains the "undisputed leader."

### III. Execution Risk and Business Complexity

1.  **Complicated Administration is a Barrier:** Sublocade is only available through a restricted program (REMS), requiring certified healthcare settings for administration, which adds a layer of logistical and administrative complexity for doctors and patients compared to oral film/tablet generics. Furthermore, a competing injectable offers more flexibility in dosing (weekly or monthly) and injection sites (including the upper arm), while Sublocade is limited to the abdomen or upper gluteus.
2.  **The Business Simplification Requires Major Divestitures:** The management's push for "simplifying the business structure" involves exploring strategic alternatives for non-core assets like its new opioid overdose reversal spray, Opvee, and its entire non-U.S. business, indicating that significant organizational complexity remains and the core focus is not yet fully streamlined.

---

## Bear Case Thesis for Indivior PLC (INDV)

The bull case dramatically understates the impact of rising competition and regulatory/reimbursement pressures, shifting the investment story from one of guaranteed growth to one of a mature asset under siege.

1.  **Competitive Erosion of the LAI Monopoly:** Sublocade’s "robust moat" is being rapidly challenged by a direct, already-approved competitor, Brixadi, which offers both monthly and more flexible weekly dosing. This competition will force pricing concessions and market share loss, making the target of $1.5 billion in peak annual sales increasingly difficult and delayed.
2.  **Financial Contraction During the Pivot:** The combined revenue loss from the generic erosion of the legacy Suboxone Film business, the discontinuation of Perseris, and the initial competitive impact on Sublocade is expected to lead to an overall net revenue decline in the near term. This contraction, coupled with restructuring costs, postpones the promised "immediate" improvement in profit margins.
3.  **Reimbursement Risk for Premium Pricing:** Headwinds from "payor dynamics" and the explicit exclusion of key government payers (Medicare/Medicaid) from copay assistance programs signal that favorable reimbursement for the high-priced injectable is not guaranteed. Payers will increasingly favor the long-acting injectable competitor, or even push for the cheaper generic oral films, which constrains Sublocade's premium pricing.
4.  **Limited Long-Term Pipeline:** The company is not prioritizing its R&D pipeline to maintain "undisputed leadership," relying heavily on one core product in an increasingly competitive category. This lack of a strong, next-generation product creates a medium-term patent cliff risk and leaves the company vulnerable to superior long-acting injectable technologies from competitors.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the extensive analysis provided, the investment case hinges on the stability of the Sublocade moat versus rising competition. The information gathered so far (Long Thesis vs. Bear Scenario) is contradictory, but the initial web search provides some current clarity, particularly from the Q2 2025 earnings update.

Here are the most important questions left unanswered and the next steps to investigate, focusing on resolving the competitive and financial conflict:

### Next Steps to Investigate

1.  **Direct Comparison of LAI Competition (Brixadi vs. Sublocade)**
    *   The bear case suggests competition is accelerating, while the moat analysis is robust. To resolve this, a quantitative comparison is needed.
    *   **Investigate:** What is the most recent **market share data** for Brixadi versus Sublocade in the long-acting injectable (LAI) buprenorphine segment? Specifically, look for data on which product is gaining momentum in terms of new patient starts and overall prescriptions. The search results confirmed that Brixadi offers weekly and monthly dosing, more injection sites, and greater dosing flexibility, which are crucial differentiators.

2.  **Verify New Management's Operational Execution and Profit Trajectory**
    *   The latest Q2 2025 results show that while total revenue only increased slightly year-over-year, **SUBLOCADE revenue grew 9%** and the company **raised its 2025 guidance**. Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income showed a year-over-year decrease in Q1 2025, but the Q2 2025 results indicate a return to net profit.
    *   **Investigate:** Given the Q2 profit and raised guidance, what are the *specific* updated (Q2 2025 earnings call) details on the planned cost-cutting ("Action Agenda") and restructuring charges? Is the company still on track for cost savings flow-through in 2026, or are the short-term restructuring costs offsetting gains as the bear case suggests?

3.  **Analyze the Valuation and M&A Scenario**
    *   The stock is up significantly over the past year, and one analysis states the P/E of 54.8x is **expensive**, suggesting investors are pricing in high future growth. However, there's also a deep value calculation with an IV/P of 2.0 (suggesting undervaluation) from a Q1 2025 article. This is a major disconnect.
    *   **Investigate:** Given the Nasdaq consolidation and activist shareholder pressure, is there any **current, non-speculative commentary** from management or analysts regarding the potential for M&A activity (either as an acquirer for diversification, or as a target)? This is critical for the "long-term catalyst" and "shareholder value" sections.

4.  **Confirm Pipeline Milestones (The Long-Term Moat)**
    *   The long-term moat relies on next-generation LAIs. The information confirms the **INDV-6001 (3-month injectable) Phase 2 last patient visit is expected in Q4 2025**.
    *   **Investigate:** What is the estimated timeline for the **INDV-6001 Phase 2 data readout** (not just the last patient visit), and when is Phase 3 expected to begin? This will set the new patent cliff horizon.

5.  **Deeper Dive into Payor Dynamics and Reimbursement Risk**
    *   The bear case cited "payor dynamics" as a headwind. Since Sublocade is premium-priced and heavily reliant on government programs (Medicare/Medicaid) which are excluded from copay assistance, this is a major risk.
    *   **Investigate:** How is Indivior specifically addressing the reimbursement hurdle for new patients on Medicare/Medicaid? Are there any recent state or federal policy changes (post-Q2 2025) regarding **LAI buprenorphine coverage** that could fundamentally change the competitive landscape?
