## PagSeguro Digital Ltd. (PAGS) Stock Valuation

### I. Initial Financial Data (As of March 31, 2025)

The base currency for the model is the Brazilian Real (R$).

**1. Total Cash & Cash Equivalents**
Based on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim balance sheet from the Q1 2025 6-K filing (all amounts in thousands of Reais):

| Item | Value (R$ thousands) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash and cash equivalents | R$ 954,123 | Highly liquid cash assets. |
| Financial investments | R$ 658,365 | Considered liquid marketable securities. |
| **Total Cash/Liquid Assets** | **R$ 1,612,488** | **R$ 1.612 Billion** |

**2. Total Debt**
The company operates a financial ecosystem, and its liabilities (R$ 56.61 billion as of Q2 2024) are largely composed of customer deposits, payables to third parties, and float, which are operational liabilities rather than traditional interest-bearing debt. A traditional "Total Debt" line item (like long-term borrowings or notes payable) is not explicitly high or a primary focus on the recent partial balance sheet snippets. For this valuation, we adopt the view that the company is largely financed by float/deposits and has a negligible amount of interest-bearing debt relative to its total float.
*   **Total Debt Assumption: R$ 0 Billion**

**3. Shares Outstanding**
A consistent and conservative figure for total shares outstanding (Class A and Class B) from recent market data is used.
*   **Total Shares Outstanding:** **291.87 million**

### II. Business Engine Analysis and Revenue Projection

**Business Engine Rationale:**
PagSeguro Digital's core business model is a two-sided ecosystem combining a **Payments** platform (point-of-sale and acquiring services) and a **Digital Banking** platform (PagBank).

*   **Key Driver Shift (Management Focus):** Management has explicitly stated they are moving away from a focus on Total Payment Volume (TPV) and market share towards **profitability** and **cross-selling** high-margin financial products.
*   **Banking Segment Growth:** The PagBank segment is the new primary growth engine, with Banking revenue growing 61.0% year-over-year in Q2 2025 and contributing a higher share of Gross Profit (26.4% in Q2 2025, up from 13% in Q1 2024). The gross profit margin in the banking segment is very high (up to 70%).
*   **Repricing and Margin:** The company initiated a strategic repricing process in response to higher Brazilian interest rates, which has helped offset financial costs and maintain Gross Profit Margin.
*   **Conservative Base Revenue:**
    *   LTM Revenue (Q3 2024 to Q2 2025): R$4.8B + R$5.1B + R$4.9B + R$5.1B = **R$ 19.9 Billion** [cite: 4 (Step 2), 10 (Step 2), 5, 1].

**Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030):**
The projections assume a conservative, gradual deceleration from the high-teens growth seen in 2024, reflecting the maturity of the Brazilian market and the management's focus on profitable growth over volume, as well as a more challenging macroeconomic environment.

| Year | Rationale | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (R$ Billion) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LTM Q2 2025** | Base Year | - | **R$ 19.90** |
| **2025** | Reflects recent quarterly growth (11%-18% YoY) but conservatively assuming a slight slowdown for the full year. | 15.0% | **R$ 22.89** |
| **2026** | Continued strong momentum from Banking segment and successful repricing, but slower macro. | 13.0% | **R$ 25.87** |
| **2027** | Banking segment starts to mature and market competition intensifies. | 11.0% | **R$ 28.71** |
| **2028** | Growth settles into a high-single-digit range. | 9.0% | **R$ 31.29** |
| **2029** | Approaching long-term growth rate. | 7.0% | **R$ 33.48** |
| **2030** | Long-term maturity growth rate (used as the perpetuity growth rate assumption). | 5.0% | **R$ 35.15** |

### III. Margin Projections and Net Income Calculation

**1. Margin Projections**
*   **Gross Margin:** Recent figures are 38%-39.3% [cite: 10 (Step 2), 4 (Step 2), 5 (Step 2)]. The conservative assumption is a slight increase to reflect the growing, high-margin PagBank contribution.
*   **Net Income Margin:** LTM Net Income Margin is 11.7% (R$2.322B NI / R$19.9B Revenue). The conservative assumption is a gradual, consistent increase due to operational leverage and the favorable business mix shift.

| Year | Gross Margin | Net Income Margin | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 40.0% | 12.0% | Slight margin improvement from LTM due to better mix/repricing. |
| **2026** | 41.0% | 13.5% | Continual shift to high-margin banking. |
| **2027** | 42.0% | 15.0% | Reaching solid profitability targets. |
| **2028** | 43.0% | 16.5% | Strong operational leverage effect. |
| **2029** | 44.0% | 17.5% | Near-peak margin from current business model. |
| **2030** | 45.0% | 18.0% | Final assumed stable margin. |

**2. ROIC and Net Income Calculation**
*   **ROIC Assumption:** We will use a conservative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **15.0%** based on the company's reported LTM Return on Average Equity (ROE) of 15.0%-15.2% [cite: 5, 3 (Step 2)].
*   **Assumption:** Net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year, and is reinvested at the assumed ROIC.

| Year | Projected Revenue (R$ Bil.) | NI Margin | Base Net Income (R$ Bil.) | Prior Year Cash NI (R$ Bil.) | ROIC % | ROIC Income (R$ Bil.) | **Total Projected Net Income (R$ Bil.)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | R$ 19.90 | 11.7% | R$ 2.32 | N/A | N/A | N/A | **N/A** |
| **2025** | R$ 22.89 | 12.0% | R$ 2.75 | R$ 2.32* | 15.0% | R$ 0.35 | **R$ 3.10** |
| **2026** | R$ 25.87 | 13.5% | R$ 3.50 | R$ 3.10 | 15.0% | R$ 0.47 | **R$ 3.97** |
| **2027** | R$ 28.71 | 15.0% | R$ 4.31 | R$ 3.97 | 15.0% | R$ 0.60 | **R$ 4.91** |
| **2028** | R$ 31.29 | 16.5% | R$ 5.16 | R$ 4.91 | 15.0% | R$ 0.74 | **R$ 5.90** |
| **2029** | R$ 33.48 | 17.5% | R$ 5.86 | R$ 5.90 | 15.0% | R$ 0.89 | **R$ 6.75** |
| **2030** | R$ 35.15 | 18.0% | R$ 6.33 | R$ 6.75 | 15.0% | R$ 1.01 | **R$ 7.34** |

*\*The initial "Prior Year Cash NI" uses the LTM Q2 2025 Net Income (R$ 2.32 Billion) to provide a conservative, immediate reinvestment income for 2025, starting the compounding effect.*

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

**1. Discount Rate and Maturity Rate Assumption**

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** Given the high-growth, emerging market (Brazil) fintech nature, a high discount rate is required to account for sovereign and currency risk, even with the company's strong profitability. A discount rate of **10.0%** will be used.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** The assumed perpetual growth rate for the terminal value, which is very conservative, is set at **3.0%**. This is significantly below the projected 2030 growth rate and is in line with or below long-term GDP growth for Brazil.

**2. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation**

| Year | Total Projected Net Income (R$ Bil.) | Discount Rate (10.0%) | Discount Factor | NPV of Cash Flow (R$ Bil.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | R$ 3.10 | 10.0% | 0.909 | R$ 2.82 |
| **2026** | R$ 3.97 | 10.0% | 0.826 | R$ 3.28 |
| **2027** | R$ 4.91 | 10.0% | 0.751 | R$ 3.69 |
| **2028** | R$ 5.90 | 10.0% | 0.683 | R$ 4.03 |
| **2029** | R$ 6.75 | 10.0% | 0.621 | R$ 4.19 |
| **2030** | R$ 7.34 | 10.0% | 0.564 | R$ 4.14 |

**Sum of Discounted Project Cash Flows (2025-2030): R$ 22.15 Billion**

**3. Terminal Value Calculation**
Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the 2030 Net Income as the final cash flow (CF) and the Perpetuity Growth Model:

TV = [CF2030 * (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
TV = [R$ 7.34 Billion * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.10 - 0.03)
TV = R$ 7.56 Billion / 0.07
**Terminal Value (2030) = R$ 108.00 Billion**

**4. Discounted Terminal Value (NPV of TV)**
NPV of TV = TV / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year
NPV of TV = R$ 108.00 Billion / (1.10)^6
NPV of TV = R$ 108.00 Billion / 1.77156
**NPV of Terminal Value = R$ 60.96 Billion**

**5. Total Enterprise Value (EV) and Equity Value**
Total EV = Sum of Discounted Project Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value
Total EV = R$ 22.15 Billion + R$ 60.96 Billion
**Total EV = R$ 83.11 Billion**

Equity Value = Total EV + Cash & Liquid Assets - Total Debt
Equity Value = R$ 83.11 Billion + R$ 1.61 Billion - R$ 0.00 Billion
**Equity Value = R$ 84.72 Billion**

### V. Fair Value Calculation

**1. Fair Value Per Share (R$)**
Fair Value Per Share (R$) = Equity Value / Total Shares Outstanding
Fair Value Per Share (R$) = R$ 84,720,000,000 / 291,870,000 shares
**Fair Value Per Share (R$) = R$ 290.26**

**2. Fair Value Per Share (USD)**
Assuming an approximate, conservative exchange rate of R$ 5.00 to US$ 1.00.

Fair Value Per Share (USD) = Fair Value Per Share (R$) / Exchange Rate
Fair Value Per Share (USD) = R$ 290.26 / 5.00
**Fair Value Per Share (USD) = $58.05**

---

### VI. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share: $58.05**

*   *Note: This valuation is based on an assumed US$/BRL exchange rate of 5.00.*

**Current Market Price and Justification**
To address the required comparison, an external search is used to obtain the current price for context.
*   **Current Stock Price (Approximation):** ~$9.03 (Price from Oct 2025 snippet in Step 2)

The calculated fair value of **$58.05** is **significantly higher** than the approximate market price of $9.03.

**Justification for the Discrepancy:**

The substantial difference between the intrinsic (DCF) value and the market price can be attributed to the market applying much more punitive, conservative, or high-risk assumptions than those used in this conservative-yet-optimistic DCF model.

1.  **Risk Premium (Discount Rate):** While the DCF used a high 10.0% discount rate, the market is likely factoring in a *much* higher required rate of return due to:
    *   **Brazilian Macro Risk:** High inflation, political instability, and currency volatility (Real/Dollar exchange rate risk). The market demands a very high risk premium for future cash flows in BRL.
    *   **Regulatory/Competition Risk:** The Brazilian fintech landscape is fiercely competitive, and PagSeguro's margins are constantly under threat from new entrants (like Nubank) and regulatory changes (like instant payment system Pix).

2.  **Growth and Margin Conservative Assumption:** Although the growth and margin projections were built on management's stated shift to profitability, the market may be projecting:
    *   **More Severe Deceleration:** The market may believe the growth in the core payments business will fall much faster than the model's conservative glide path, and the banking segment's growth may be unsustainable against larger, more established banks.
    *   **Margin Compression:** The market may not believe the company can sustain and improve its net margin to 18.0%, expecting continued fierce competition to compress profitability below current levels. The DCF model assumes the shift to the high-margin Banking business is a permanent structural advantage.

3.  **Terminal Value Discount:** The primary driver of the high DCF value is the Terminal Value (R$60.96 Billion NPV). If the market assumes a much lower perpetual growth rate (e.g., 1.0% instead of 3.0%), or a much higher discount rate (e.g., 15% instead of 10%), the Terminal Value contribution collapses, bringing the fair value closer to the current price.

**Conclusion:** The market is pricing PAGS as a high-risk, lower-growth company facing significant emerging market and competitive headwinds. My model, though conservative on margins and growth from a purely operational perspective, assumes a higher level of success in compounding capital (15.0% ROIC) and a more stable macro environment (10.0% discount rate) than the market is currently willing to accept. The difference represents the market's severe discount for *unquantifiable risk* (country/sovereign risk) and extreme conservatism on the perpetuity of high-growth, high-margin revenue.
