## Business Summary

Rafael Holdings, Inc. primarily operates as an investment holding company, focused on owning and managing commercial real estate assets, such as office buildings, mainly located within the United States. The company generates revenue by renting space to other businesses (B2B), which serves as its primary source of income. A secondary part of its model involves managing legacy assets and minority stakes in the highly speculative life science and biotechnology sectors, hoping for large, future payouts if those specific investments succeed. The overall strategy is to generate stable cash flow from property rentals while maintaining exposure to high-growth, high-risk pharmaceutical endeavors.

## Business Model Risk

A significant near-term risk stems from its heavy reliance on the commercial real estate market. If interest rates rise rapidly, or if property vacancies increase due to economic downturns or changes in working trends (like remote work), RFL could face reduced rental income and difficulty refinancing property debt. Cyclical real estate downturns have historically harmed earnings for similar companies, and this threat is acutely concerning now given current high interest rates. A major long-term risk is the unpredictable nature of its residual life science investments. These ventures are highly volatile; if the partnered drugs or technologies fail regulatory approval or clinical trials, the company faces a total loss on those potentially high-value assets, which could deeply harm its future earnings potential and market position. This risk is inherent in speculative holding models, as RFL often lacks direct control over these external investments.

## Company History

This history of Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL) is presented in simple, jargon-free English to help you understand the company's journey from its beginnings to its current focus.

### The History of Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL)

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose (2018)**

1.  **A Corporate Spin-Off:** Rafael Holdings, Inc. was not created as a traditional startup, but as a spin-off from its parent company, IDT Corporation, and began trading independently in March 2018.
2.  **The Original Dual Goal:** The company was founded with a dual strategic mission: to be a holding company managing **commercial real estate assets** and, more significantly, to invest in and develop **novel cancer therapies** through its pharmaceutical interests.
3.  **Initial Assets and Capital:** As part of the separation, Rafael Holdings inherited commercial properties in places like Newark and Jerusalem, along with its initial major investments in two oncology-focused pharmaceutical companies, including Rafael Pharmaceuticals.
4.  **A Specialized Focus:** The idea was to separate these non-core assets from IDT’s primary business (communications and payment services) so that the new, independent Rafael Holdings could dedicate specialized focus and capital to both the real estate and the high-risk, high-reward business of drug development.

#### **II. Headwinds and Challenges (2018 - 2022)**

5.  **Focus on Cancer Metabolism:** The pharmaceutical segment, primarily through its investment in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, concentrated on developing a drug called CPI-613 (Devimistat). This drug aimed for an innovative approach by targeting the unique way cancer cells process energy, known as cancer metabolism.
6.  **The Major Headwind: Clinical Trial Failure (2021-2022):** The most significant challenge arose when the lead drug, CPI-613, failed to meet its main goals in pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for two difficult-to-treat cancers: metastatic pancreatic cancer and relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
7.  **Consequence of the Failure:** This clinical setback was a devastating blow to the company’s core strategy, immediately undermining the value and future of its pharmaceutical segment. A planned merger with Rafael Pharmaceuticals, which would have created a unified, focused oncology company, was terminated following the trial results.
8.  **The Need for Cash Burn Management:** Drug development, especially late-stage clinical trials, requires massive financial investment, often referred to as a "cash burn." With the main drug candidate failing, the company was forced to reassess this unsustainable expenditure.

#### **III. Innovative Solutions and Strategic Realignment (2022 - Present)**

9.  **The Innovative Solution: Strategic Pivot:** Following the trial failures, the company executed a significant strategic shift, winding down most of its costly pharmaceutical research and development activities.
10. **The Stable Backstop (Tailwind):** Rafael Holdings was fortunate to have its **real estate portfolio** as a stable asset base—a critical "tailwind"—which provided a solid foundation and financial security when the pharmaceutical side failed. This allowed it to maintain a cash balance and look for new investment opportunities.
11. **Refocusing the Drug Strategy:** Instead of closing its biotech ambitions, the company transformed its approach from being a drug developer to being a strategic investor in the biotech space, looking for undervalued assets with strong clinical data. This strategic change was a key solution to revive its healthcare focus.
12. **The New Major Investment (Recent Pivot):** A recent development is the company's agreement to merge with **Cyclo Therapeutics, Inc.**, a clinical-stage biotech company. This marks a major pivot into a completely new therapeutic area: developing a drug for Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC) disease, a rare and devastating genetic disorder.
13. **The Current Goal:** Today, Rafael Holdings operates as a holding company focused on two main areas: continuing to manage and potentially monetize its commercial real estate assets, and investing in and supporting the development of its new clinical-stage biotech asset, Cyclo Therapeutics, to deliver a breakthrough treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C1.

## Moat Analysis

Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL) is primarily a holding company whose "moat" or competitive advantage is not a single, dominant feature but rather a collection of high-risk, high-reward intellectual property across its various investments. The company's current strategy is a shift from its own internal, early-stage research to acquiring or investing in later-stage assets to manage risk.

The core of its competitive differentiation comes from intellectual property (IP) and regulatory exclusivity in niche markets, rather than cost advantages or network effects.

### **The Moat: A Biotech Play on Intellectual Property (IP) and Regulatory Exclusivity**

1.  **Orphan Drug Exclusivity (The Main Moat):** The company's current core asset is **Trappsol® Cyclo™**, a drug for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1), a rare and fatal genetic disorder. If approved by the FDA, its Orphan Drug Designation would grant **seven years of market exclusivity** in the US, effectively creating a temporary, powerful monopoly in a high-need market with significant pricing power.
2.  **Specialized Mechanism of Action (Biotech Differentiation):** In its pharmaceutical investments (Cyclo Therapeutics, Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals), the differentiation lies in a unique scientific approach. The lead drug candidate, Trappsol® Cyclo™, works by directly mobilizing cholesterol that accumulates in cells, addressing the root cause of NPC1. Its former flagship program, devimistat, targeted the unique energy metabolism of cancer cells—a relatively specialized area of oncology research.
3.  **Intellectual Property in Delivery Technology:** The company has an interest in **Day Three Labs**, which has a proprietary, **patented protein-based infusion technology** called Unlokt™. This technology encapsulates cannabinoids within a natural protein to significantly enhance the drug’s absorption into the bloodstream (high bioavailability) and bypass the liver’s first-pass metabolism, offering a major technical advantage over conventional methods like emulsions. This patent protection is a key component of its differentiation in the cannabinoid market.

### **Pricing Power, Market Position, and Customer Stickiness**

1.  **Pricing Power is High-Risk/High-Reward:** True pricing power only exists if and when the pharmaceutical products, particularly Trappsol® Cyclo™ for NPC1, receive final regulatory approval. In the rare disease market, where there are few or no existing treatments, successful drugs typically command a premium price, but this pricing power is completely dependent on clinical success.
2.  **Customer/Contract Stickiness (Biotech):** For the pharmaceutical segment, "stickiness" is regulatory, not contractual. If Trappsol® Cyclo™ is approved, patients with the severe, chronic disease would be highly "sticky" due to the lack of alternatives, the life-threatening nature of the disease, and the difficulty of switching a life-saving therapy.
3.  **Customer/Contract Stickiness (Infusion/Cannabinoid Tech):** For its technology investments (like Day Three Labs), the stickiness comes from its B2B licensing model with manufacturers. The patented nature and superior performance of the technology—faster onset and more consistent experience—create high switching costs for partners who would need to reformulate their entire product line to move to a competitor.

### **R&D, Displacement, and Growth History**

1.  **R&D is Strategically Outsourced:** Following a major setback in its internal cancer drug program (devimistat failed two Phase 3 trials in 2021), the company decided to **curtail its own early-stage R&D** and pre-clinical research. The current strategy is to find an edge by **investing in, acquiring, or in-licensing later-stage clinical assets** that already have promising data, essentially shifting the R&D burden and initial innovation risk to others.
2.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital:** The company is highly susceptible to displacement by competitors with more capital. The ultimate competitive advantage for its primary assets is a successful Phase 3 clinical trial outcome. If its drug candidate fails, a rival drug in development, like one from **Zevra Therapeutics**, could be approved first and capture the market, immediately displacing Rafael’s potential revenue stream. The company's future value is heavily concentrated on the clinical success of a single program.
3.  **Reason for Growth:** The company's growth into a biotech holding entity, particularly its recent pivot, is due to the **strategic corporate action of merging with and focusing on Cyclo Therapeutics**. The previous growth engine (devimistat) stalled due to clinical trial failure. The current value proposition rests almost entirely on successfully advancing the **Trappsol® Cyclo™** program through regulatory approval.

## Catalyst Analysis

Based on a review of recent news, financial reports, and management commentary, the catalysts for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL) focus almost entirely on its recent strategic shift and the development of its new lead drug candidate.

### Catalysts for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL)

#### Near-Term Catalysts (Within 6-12 Months)

1.  **Phase 3 Clinical Trial Data Readout (Trappsol® Cyclo™):** The most significant near-term event is the expected release of the 48-week interim analysis results from the fully enrolled Phase 3 clinical trial (TransportNPC™) for Trappsol® Cyclo™. These results are anticipated in the **middle of 2025** and will serve as the first major indication of the drug's effectiveness for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1).
2.  **Financial Position and Runway:** The company has a strong cash position, reporting \$37.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of April 30, 2025, and recently completed a \$25 million rights offering to support the lead drug program. This substantial funding provides the necessary financial runway to complete the clinical trial and reach the key data milestone.
3.  **Completion of Cyclo Therapeutics Merger:** The company successfully completed its merger with Cyclo Therapeutics in March 2025, solidifying its identity as a focused, clinical-stage biotechnology company with a lead asset in the rare disease space.

#### Long-Term Catalysts

1.  **Potential for Regulatory Approval (Trappsol® Cyclo™):** A successful Phase 3 trial, culminating in final data and a New Drug Application (NDA) filing, is the primary long-term catalyst. Approval of Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1), a rare and fatal genetic disorder, would transform the company into a commercial-stage entity.
2.  **Expanding Drug Pipeline and Indications:** The drug candidate, Trappsol® Cyclo™, has Orphan Drug Designation in both the United States and Europe and is also being tested in other clinical trials, including for early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, which presents a long-term opportunity for new market expansion.
3.  **Monetizing Legacy Assets and Future Acquisitions:** The company is currently evaluating its other legacy operating entities and portfolio assets following its new focus. Future strategic transactions, like the potential sale or licensing of these non-core holdings, could provide additional cash or unlock value for shareholders.

#### Management Strategy (Explicitly Mentioned)

*   **Focus on Later-Stage Assets:** Bill Conkling, President and CEO, stated that the merger and the new focus on Trappsol® Cyclo™ is a "major step forward in our strategy to develop clinical stage assets in areas of high unmet medical need."
*   **Commitment to Lead Program:** Management has made it clear that they intend to focus "strategic efforts and resources" on the new core asset, Trappsol® Cyclo™. The CEO expressed enthusiasm, stating, "We eagerly await the interim analysis in the middle of 2025," and believes Trappsol® Cyclo™ has the potential to be a "market leader" despite existing competition.
*   **Leveraging Strong Balance Sheet:** The strategy, previously announced, was to use their strong balance sheet—which includes a significant cash position—to fund and advance later-stage assets, a commitment reinforced by the recent financing to support the TransportNPC™ trial.

## Management Record

The management of Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL) has been characterized by significant strategic pivots and the dominant presence of its founder, reflecting a complex and volatile history for investors.

### **I. CEO and Key Management**

1.  **Founder's Dominance:** Howard Jonas, the founder of IDT Corporation (from which Rafael Holdings was spun off in 2018), is the company's most influential figure, serving as the Chairman and currently the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) since June 2025, following a previous stint as CEO.
2.  **High Insider Ownership:** Mr. Jonas is the largest individual shareholder, owning over 50% of the company's shares, which may align his interests directly with long-term shareholder value creation, and he has been a net buyer of company stock.
3.  **Recent Management Team:** The management team has a short average tenure of around 0.7 years as of early 2025, reflecting the frequent leadership and strategic changes. Key current executives, in addition to Jonas, include David Polinsky (CFO) and Joshua Fine (COO).

### **II. History and Management Changes**

4.  **Initial Spin-off and Focus:** Rafael Holdings was established in 2018 as a spin-off from IDT Corporation, initially focusing on a dual model of pharmaceutical development (via Rafael Pharmaceuticals) and commercial real estate holdings.
5.  **Failed Pharmaceutical Strategy:** The primary drug candidate, CPI-613® (devimistat), failed to meet its primary endpoints in two Phase 3 clinical trials for metastatic pancreatic cancer and acute myeloid leukemia in late 2021.
6.  **Multiple CEO Transitions:** This major clinical failure triggered multiple leadership shifts; Ameet Mallik, who was hired in 2021 to grow the company into a commercial organization, transitioned out of the CEO role in early 2022, with Chairman Howard Jonas taking over. William Conkling, initially a Chief Commercial Officer, then became CEO (circa 2022) before resigning in May 2025, leading to Jonas stepping in again as CEO following a major merger.

### **III. Management Performance and Track Record**

7.  **Delivery on Promises (Setback):** The initial promise of becoming a late-stage commercial oncology company, based on the lead drug candidate CPI-613, was not delivered due to the 2021 Phase 3 trial failures.
8.  **Strategic Execution (Pivot):** Following the clinical failure, management executed a swift strategic realignment, curtailing early-stage development to reduce costs, selling real estate assets to bolster the balance sheet, and shifting to an asset management/opportunistic investment focus.
9.  **Financial Performance:** The company has operated at a net loss, though recent reports indicate a significant reduction in the net loss compared to the prior year, attributed to financial adjustments related to acquisitions and investments.
10. **Shareholder Value:** The stock has underperformed both the US Pharmaceuticals industry and the broader US market over the past year, and the share price has declined significantly over the past five years, indicating a poor historical track record for delivering value to shareholders.

### **IV. Future Strategy and Vision**

11. **Current Strategic Focus:** The current strategy, post-merger with Cyclo Therapeutics, is to reposition Rafael Holdings as a late-stage clinical biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for rare genetic disorders.
12. **Key Clinical Asset:** The primary focus is now on the Trappsol® Cyclo™ Phase 3 clinical trial for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1, with interim results expected in mid-2025.
13. **Holding Company Vision:** The broader vision remains that of a holding company focused on maximizing the value of its underlying assets, which include its new pharmaceutical interests and its commercial real estate portfolio.
14. **Investment Strategy:** The management's plan is to leverage the company's cash position to fund the clinical trial and to seek opportunities to acquire, in-license, or invest in additional later-stage clinical assets to improve shareholder value.

## Management Incentive

Based on an analysis of available data, the management incentive and compensation structure for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL), particularly for its key executive, strongly suggests a significant alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Analysis of Management Incentive and Compensation for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL)**

1.  **Insider Ownership is Extremely High:** The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Howard Jonas, directly owns a substantial 52.22% of the company's shares. This level of insider ownership is a powerful incentive, as the CEO's personal wealth is intrinsically tied to the performance and appreciation of the company's stock, directly aligning his financial interests with those of all shareholders (the "higher the better" condition is met).

2.  **Compensation is Performance-Driven:** The CEO's total yearly compensation is heavily weighted toward non-salary incentives, with only about 7.5% from salary and 92.5% from bonuses, which include company stock and options. This structure minimizes fixed compensation and maximizes incentives tied to long-term stock performance and achieving corporate goals.

3.  **Stock Awards Include Long-Term Vesting:** A separate filing for the CFO's compensation showed unvested restricted shares with vesting dates extending to 2029, indicating that a portion of executive compensation is structured for long-term retention and performance, rather than immediate payout.

4.  **Low Management and Board Tenure:** The management team and the board of directors have relatively low average tenures (0.7 years for management and 1.7 years for the board). This may indicate recent turnover or a new strategic direction, which introduces some uncertainty, though the CEO's dominant ownership mitigates concerns about a lack of commitment.

***

### **Conclusion on Management Incentives**

*   **Strong Incentive to Act in Shareholder Interest:** The very high insider ownership by the CEO (52.22%) and a compensation structure that is overwhelmingly weighted towards stock-based incentives and bonuses create a strong, fundamental alignment between management's financial well-being and the creation of shareholder value. The CEO cannot significantly enrich himself without also increasing the value for all shareholders.
*   **Low Risk of "Lining Their Own Pockets":** Due to the low proportion of cash salary and the high percentage of personal stock ownership, the management team, especially the CEO, is not primarily incentivized to focus on short-term gains or excessive fixed compensation. Their primary financial reward is dependent on the long-term success of the company's stock price.

## Long Thesis

Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL) is undergoing a critical transformation, pivoting away from failed cancer research to become a clinical-stage biotech holding company focused on a high-value, niche market. The entire bull case hinges on the success of its new core asset, Trappsol® Cyclo™, a drug for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1), a rare and fatal genetic disorder.In the near term (mid-2025), the stock is poised for a massive rebound from its current low price if the interim results from the crucial Phase 3 clinical trial show the drug is effective. Positive results would immediately validate management's recent strategic merger and inject significant optimism into the stock price.For the long term, successful regulatory approval of Trappsol® Cyclo™ by the FDA would transform RFL. Since NPC1 is a rare disease, the drug would receive seven years of market exclusivity (a temporary monopoly), allowing the company to charge premium prices and generate high revenue streams with minimal competition. This outcome would convert RFL from a speculative investment into a commercial-stage biopharma company, creating substantial shareholder value. Furthermore, the stable commercial real estate portfolio provides a financial cushion, ensuring the company has the necessary cash runway to complete the expensive drug development process without immediately needing to raise more money by selling shares.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the lead drug candidate, Trappsol® Cyclo™, successfully meets its main goals in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, with positive interim data reported in mid-2025. Following successful trials, the drug must receive final regulatory approval (FDA and EMA). The company must maintain its financial stability and cash runway, either through property rentals or disciplined spending, to fund the clinical process until approval without resorting to highly dilutive capital raises. Finally, the company must successfully maintain its Orphan Drug designation and exclusivity for seven years, and no competing drug (such as one from Zevra Therapeutics) must receive approval first and capture the market.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several critical holes and faults in the bullish thesis for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL), providing the basis for a bearish outlook.

### **Bear Case Thesis for Rafael Holdings, Inc. (RFL)**

The long thesis fundamentally fails due to the prior approval of a competing drug, eliminating the crucial "temporary monopoly" that underpins the bull case's entire financial model. Furthermore, the key clinical catalyst is mischaracterized and delayed, increasing the financial strain and risk of further shareholder dilution.

---

### **Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis**

#### **1. Loss of Market Exclusivity and Competitive Disadvantage (The Most Critical Flaw)**

*   **Flawed Exclusivity Assumption:** The long thesis's core financial assumption—that Trappsol® Cyclo™ would receive seven years of market exclusivity (a temporary monopoly) and be the first-to-market drug—is factually incorrect.
*   **Existing Market Competition:** The FDA has already approved a competing oral drug, **arimoclomol (Miplyffa), developed by Zevra Therapeutics, in September 2024** for the treatment of neurological symptoms associated with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) in adults and children $\geq2$ years old.
*   **Erosion of Premium Pricing:** Zevra's drug, as the first approved therapy, will capture the market and likely secured the 7-year Orphan Drug exclusivity, severely limiting the high revenue streams and "premium prices with minimal competition" projected for Trappsol® Cyclo™.

#### **2. Mischaracterized and Delayed Clinical Catalyst**

*   **Mischaracterization of Interim Data:** The long thesis projects a "massive rebound" in "mid-2025" from positive interim results. The 48-week interim data review by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) **already occurred (around mid-2025)**, and the result was merely a recommendation to **continue the 96-week study**, which only indicates the drug was not stopped for futility or safety concerns, not that it met its primary efficacy endpoint.
*   **Delayed Pivotal Readout:** The true "make-or-break" catalyst is the full 96-week pivotal data readout, which will not occur until **mid-2026** (a year later than the suggested "mid-2025" timeframe in the thesis), pushing the major value inflection point significantly further into the future.
*   **Uncertain Efficacy Hurdle:** Since the study was not stopped early for overwhelming positive efficacy (which can happen in rare disease trials), the ultimate success of the drug remains highly speculative, and Trappsol® Cyclo™ must now demonstrate clear clinical superiority over the approved, orally-administered competitor to gain significant market share.

#### **3. Financial Instability and Dilution Risk**

*   **Inadequate Cash Cushion:** While the commercial real estate portfolio provides a cushion, the company reported a **net loss of approximately \$18 million for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2024**, demonstrating a significant cash burn rate.
*   **Recent Dilutive Financing:** The company already resorted to a **\$25 million rights offering (a dilutive capital raise)** to fund its strategic objectives and clinical process, directly contradicting the long thesis's assumption that it could fund development "without resorting to highly dilutive capital raises."
*   **Prolonged Cash Burn:** With the pivotal data readout now pushed out to mid-2026, the company will have to sustain its cash burn for at least another year, increasing the high probability of further dilutive financing events before any commercial revenue can be generated.

---

## Next Steps

The initial investigation has revealed a critical flaw in the Long Thesis, making the next steps much more focused on competitive analysis and financial survivability.

### **Key Unanswered Questions and Next Steps for Investigation**

The most critical finding is the FDA approval of a competitor drug, which fundamentally changes the market dynamics for Rafael Holdings.

#### **I. Competitive Landscape and Remaining Market Opportunity (Priority)**

1.  **Direct Comparison of Therapies (Trappsol® Cyclo™ vs. Miplyffa™):** The long thesis's assumption of a temporary monopoly is **false**; Zevra Therapeutics' Miplyffa (arimoclomol) was FDA-approved in September 2024 as the first treatment for neurological symptoms associated with NPC. Investigate how Trappsol® Cyclo™ (intravenous infusion) can compete with an already-approved, orally-administered drug like Miplyffa. *The value inflection has shifted from 'first to market' to 'best in class.'*
2.  **Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) Status:** Confirm if Zevra's Miplyffa approval triggers the 7-year Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) for the entire NPC indication. If it does, determine the specific narrow indication that Trappsol® Cyclo™ must achieve to avoid being blocked from market entry or facing severe pricing pressure.
3.  **Mechanism of Action and Clinical Superiority:** Deep dive into the difference between the two drugs: Miplyffa (an oral medication that is a heat shock protein co-inducer, used with miglustat) versus Trappsol® Cyclo™ (an intravenous infusion that mobilizes cholesterol, targeting the root cause). Investigate if Trappsol® Cyclo™ is positioned to treat a wider range of symptoms (including visceral, or organ-related) or a more severe subset of the disease that the oral competitor does not cover.

#### **II. Critical Financial Runway and Real Estate Stability**

4.  **Confirm Pivotal Data Readout and Cash Burn:** The pivotal Phase 3 data for Trappsol® Cyclo™ is now expected after the full 96-week study, which suggests a target date in **mid-2026**, not mid-2025 as initially hoped (the mid-2025 announcement was a recommendation to continue the trial, not positive efficacy data). Determine the current projected cash burn rate and if the existing cash balance of \$37.9 million (as of April 30, 2025, per the analysis) is sufficient to reach the mid-2026 readout without a further dilutive capital raise.
5.  **Status and Monetization of Commercial Real Estate:** The commercial real estate portfolio is a core non-pharma asset intended as a "financial cushion." Investigate the current Net Operating Income (NOI) or recent attempts to sell or monetize the commercial properties to gauge how reliable this "cushion" is for funding the prolonged biotech venture. *This is a key mitigation for the high risk of a single biotech asset.*

#### **III. Management and Investor Sentiment**

6.  **Management Commentary Post-Competition:** Search for any recent investor presentations or press releases from Rafael Holdings or Cyclo Therapeutics *after* the September 2024 Miplyffa approval. Management must have a public strategy to address this competition; look for how they define their new competitive position.
7.  **Market Reaction and Analyst Ratings:** Find out if the recent price drops in June 2025 were fully due to the DMC continuation recommendation or if they are also linked to the high competition risk. Research any current Wall Street analyst price targets or ratings to understand the broader market consensus on the post-merger, post-competition company.
