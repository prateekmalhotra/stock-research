## 1. Financial Data and Key Assumptions

### A. Balance Sheet Data (as of June 28, 2025)

| Metric | Value (USD) | Source & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **\$387 million** | Q2 2025 Financial Highlights |
| **Total Debt (Face Value)** | **\$376 million** | Q2 2025 total debt and finance lease obligations: \$300M Senior Notes + \$76M Finance Leases |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **7.892 million** | As of July 25, 2025 |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$72.61** | Price data from a search around Oct 2025 |

### B. Historical Financials (GAAP)

| Metric | FY 2024 (Dec 28) | FY 2023 (Dec 30) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Sales** | **\$3,000 million** | \$3,184 million | FY 2024 Highlights |
| **GAAP Net Income** | **\$53.1 million** | \$48.5 million | FY 2024 Highlights (2023 includes a non-cash pension charge) |
| **Specialty Sales %** | **$\sim$69%** | $\sim$70% | FY 2024 Annual Report |
| **Total Debt (Avg for ROIC)** | $\sim$350 million | $\sim$350 million | Est. avg of 2024 Q1 and Q2 debt/notes for stability |
| **Total Equity (Avg for ROIC)** | $\sim$650 million | $\sim$600 million | Est. based on available net income figures and balance sheet growth |

### C. ROIC Calculation (Return on Invested Capital)

The Net Income forecast utilizes a conservative historical ROIC to project additional income from retained earnings.

*   **Average Invested Capital (IC):** Average IC is estimated by averaging Total Debt + Total Equity over a period, which is a proxy for the capital employed in the business.
*   **Average ROIC (2023-2024):**
    *   $ROIC = \text{Average Net Income} / \text{Average Invested Capital}$
    *   Average Net Income (2023-2024) $\approx$ (\$53.1M + \$48.5M) / 2 = \$50.8 million
    *   Conservative Estimated Average Invested Capital $\approx$ (\$350M Debt + \$625M Equity) = \$975 million
    *   **Calculated Historical ROIC $\approx$ \$50.8M / \$975M $\approx$ 5.2\%**

To remain **conservative** but project continued successful use of capital, we will use a rounded and lower **ROIC of 5.0%** for future years.

## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025 - 2030)

BlueLinx's business engine is driven by volume growth and margin capture in its two segments: **Specialty Products ($\sim$70\% of Sales)** and **Structural Products ($\sim$30\% of Sales)**. The company's stated strategy is to drive **profitable sales growth** by:
1.  Increasing **Specialty Product** sales, including market share gains in the **multifamily segment (30\% Y/Y growth in Q2 2025)**.
2.  Expanding via **greenfields** and **M&A**.
3.  Utilizing **Structural Products** to complement the core Specialty offering.

The industry is subject to high commodity price volatility (Structural) and general housing market sentiment (Specialty). The 2024 Net Sales of \$3.0B was a **5.9% decrease** from 2023 due to price deflation, despite volume increases.

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Growth Assumption** | | | | | | |
| Market Share/Volume Growth | +3.5% | +3.0% | +2.5% | +2.0% | +1.5% | +1.0% |
| Macro/Price Recovery (Conservative) | +0.0% | +1.0% | +1.5% | +2.0% | +2.0% | +2.0% |
| **Total Revenue Growth Rate** | **+3.5%** | **+4.0%** | **+4.0%** | **+4.0%** | **+3.5%** | **+3.0%** |
| | | | | | | |
| **Projected Net Sales** | **\$3,105** | **\$3,229** | **\$3,358** | **\$3,492** | **\$3,614** | **\$3,723** |

***Justification for Revenue Growth:***
*   **2025 (3.5%):** Starts from the \$3.0B 2024 base. This conservative rate is driven entirely by management's stated **volume/share gains** (3.5% reflects a moderation from the **30% multifamily Y/Y growth** but assumes success in other strategic areas), offset by continued commodity price uncertainty and the slow housing market.
*   **2026 - 2030 (4.0% declining to 3.0%):** Assumes the core volume/share gain engine slows slightly (2.5% in peak years, decreasing to 1.0% at maturity) while a **conservative macro-recovery** in the housing and commodity markets provides a gradual price uplift (1.0% to 2.0% price tailwind).

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

### A. Margin Assumptions

*   **Gross Margin (GM) %:** Structural GM is volatile (Q2 2025 at 8.2%, Q3 guide at 8-9%). Specialty GM is more stable but subject to deflation (FY 2024 at 19.4%, Q3 2025 guide at 17-18%).
    *   **Assumption:** We will use a conservative **16.5%** for 2025 (above Q2's 15.3% but below the 2024 average, reflecting margin pressure) and gradually increase it to a stable **17.0%** by 2028, reflecting the structural shift to higher-margin Specialty products (70% mix) and improved market pricing.
*   **SG&A %:** Q2 2025 SG&A was \$95 million on \$780 million sales ($\sim$12.2% of Net Sales). This reflects higher costs from volume, logistics, and digital transformation.
    *   **Assumption:** A conservative **12.0%** of Net Sales for 2025, gradually improving to a stable **11.0%** of Net Sales by 2028 as the digital and infrastructure investments yield operating leverage.
*   **Tax Rate %:** Management guided **22%** for Q3 2025.
    *   **Assumption:** A stable, conservative **22%** from 2025 onwards.

### B. Projected Net Income (Net Income to Cash Flow)

| | | | | | | |
| **Net Income from ROIC (C)** | 0.0 | 4.8 | 5.3 | 6.3 | 7.5 | 7.8 |
| **Total Net Income for Valuation (B + C)** | **96.5** | **110.7** | **131.7** | **157.2** | **164.2** | **169.6** |
| *Net Income used for Cash Flow in next year* | 96.5 | 110.7 | 131.7 | 157.2 | 164.2 | 169.6 |
| *ROIC Rate* | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| *Notes:* Net Income for ROIC in a given year is 5.0% of the previous year's "Net Income used for Cash Flow." Interest Expense is estimated at 5.33% on \$300M Notes. The entire Net Income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year.

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Rate

*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** The discount rate represents the risk and opportunity cost. Given the cyclical nature of the building products distribution industry and the recent volatility (2021-2024), we will use a reasonably high, **conservative discount rate of 10.0%**.
*   **Conservative Maturity (Perpetuity) Rate:** This long-term growth rate should be highly conservative, typically near or below the long-term GDP growth.
    *   **Conservative Maturity Rate (g) = 2.0%**

### B. Net Present Value (NPV)

| Year (t) | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | \$96.5 | 0.9091 | \$87.7 |
| **2026 (t=2)** | \$110.7 | 0.8264 | \$91.5 |
| **2027 (t=3)** | \$131.7 | 0.7513 | \$98.9 |
| **2028 (t=4)** | \$157.2 | 0.6830 | \$107.4 |
| **2029 (t=5)** | \$164.2 | 0.6209 | \$102.0 |
| **2030 (t=6)** | \$169.6 | 0.5645 | \$95.7 |
| **Total NPV of Projected Cash Flows (2025-2030)** | | | **\$583.2** |

### C. Terminal Value

The terminal value captures the value of all cash flows after 2030, using the perpetuity growth formula (Gordan Growth Model) on the 2030 cash flow.

*   Terminal Value (2030) $= (\text{2030 Cash Flow} * (1 + g)) / (r - g)$
*   Terminal Value (2030) $= (\$169.6 * 1.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$173.0 / 0.08 = \$2,162.5$ million
*   NPV of Terminal Value $= \text{Terminal Value (2030)} * \text{Discount Factor at t=6}$
*   NPV of Terminal Value $= \$2,162.5 * 0.5645 = **\$1,220.6 \text{ million}$**

### D. Implied Equity Value

*   **Total Enterprise Value** = NPV of Cash Flows + NPV of Terminal Value
*   Total Enterprise Value = \$583.2M + \$1,220.6M = \$1,803.8 million

| Metric | Value (Millions of USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **\$1,803.8** |
| (+) Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$387.0 |
| (-) Total Debt (Conservative) | \$376.0 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$1,814.8** |

---

## 5. Fair Value Per Share

*   **Fair Value Per Share** = Total Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
*   Fair Value Per Share = \$1,814.8 million / 7.892 million shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share $\approx$ \$229.95**

---

## 6. Conclusion and Justification

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$229.95** |
| **Current Market Price (Approx.)** | **\$72.61** |
| **Difference** | **+216.7%** |

### Justification for Divergence

The calculated Fair Value of **\$229.95** is **substantially higher** (over 216% higher) than the current market price of approximately **\$72.61**. This significant divergence suggests the market is making far more **pessimistic** assumptions about the company's future performance than the conservative assumptions built into this model.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. The Model's Assumptions:**

| Factor | Market's Implicit Assumption | Model's Assumption | Why the Model Differs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commodity Risk / Cycle** | The market assumes a sharp, sustained decline in structural product prices and/or the housing market, leading to a much lower Net Income base. | The model assumes a volatile but normalizing environment, with Net Sales growth of 3-4% and a solid **16.5%-17.0% Gross Margin**. | The model relies on management's ability to maintain high margins by shifting the mix to **70% Specialty Products** and successfully executing on market share gains in the stable **multifamily segment**.
| **Operating Leverage/Costs** | The market assumes SG&A costs, elevated by the **digital transformation** and logistics expenses, will remain high and permanently erode the net income margin. | The model assumes SG&A will improve from 12.0% to **11.0%** of Net Sales, resulting in strong operating leverage and a higher Net Income margin over time. | This is a core assumption about the success of the digital and growth strategy investments mentioned by management.
| **ROIC & Cash Conversion** | The market is likely discounting the value of the significant **\$387 million cash balance** or assumes future cash flow conversion will be poor. | The model assumes that the entire Net Income converts to cash and that retained earnings are conservatively reinvested at a **5.0% ROIC**. | The model gives full credit for the large cash balance and projects a reasonable, though conservative, return on that cash and future retained earnings, which significantly boosts the terminal value.

**Conclusion:**

This conservative DCF model suggests that BlueLinx Holdings Inc. is significantly **undervalued** by the market. The high intrinsic value is primarily driven by:
1.  **The current strong net cash position** (Cash > Debt).
2.  **Conservative but consistent Net Income projections** based on the company's stated shift toward the higher-margin, less volatile **Specialty Products** segment, which currently accounts for $\sim$70% of sales.
3.  **The high financial leverage** created by a stable operating margin (16.5%-17.0% GM) and a strong potential for operating expense leverage (SG&A improvement).

The market appears to be focusing too heavily on current housing/commodity cycle troughs and near-term margin volatility, failing to properly value the company's strong balance sheet, the defensive moat of its specialty product mix, and the long-term growth from its strategic initiatives like the multifamily focus and greenfield expansion. **Our fair value assessment is based on the assumption that management successfully executes its strategy of profitable sales growth and margin stability in the Specialty segment, even if the Structural segment remains volatile.**
