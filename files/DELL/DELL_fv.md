## Valuation of Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) Stock

This valuation is based on a conservative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis using financial data solely from SEC filings and management guidance from earnings call transcripts, as mandated by the instructions.

### 1. Current Financial Snapshot (SEC Filings)

The initial figures for cash, debt, and shares outstanding are based on the latest available consolidated financial statements from Dell Technologies Inc.'s SEC filings. The fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest January 31. Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) ended on January 31, 2025, and Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) is ongoing. I will use the most recent information available from the Q2 FY26 10-Q (as of August 1, 2025) and Q3 FY26 earnings commentary (as of November 25, 2025).

| Metric | Source Document/Date | Value (in millions USD) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | Q3 FY26 Earnings Call (Nov 25, 2025) | $11,300 | Management reported "cash and investments" of $11.3 billion, which serves as a highly liquid balance sheet item. |
| **Total Debt** | Q2 FY26 10-Q (Aug 1, 2025) | $28,689 | Sum of Short-term debt ($7,154M) and Long-term debt ($21,535M) from the balance sheet. |
| **Total Shares Outstanding** | Q2 FY26 10-Q (Sept 8, 2025) | 672.4 million | As of September 2, 2025, as reported in the 10-Q. |
| **Current Stock Price** | Market Data (Feb 14, 2026) | $117.49 | Most recent available market price. |

**Net Cash Position:** $11,300M - $28,689M = **$-17,389 million** (Net Debt)

### 2. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections

Dell's core business is segmented into the **Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG)** (servers, storage, networking) and the **Client Solutions Group (CSG)** (desktops, notebooks). The current and future growth engine is driven by **Artificial Intelligence (AI) server demand** within the ISG segment.

#### Business Engine Assumptions:

1.  **AI Server Demand (ISG):** This is the primary growth driver. Management reported a record AI server backlog of **$18.4 billion** and year-to-date orders of **$30 billion** as of Q3 FY26. This backlog represents substantial near-term revenue visibility and growth momentum.
2.  **Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) (Excl. AI):** Traditional server and storage markets are more cyclical. They will see modest growth driven by cloud build-outs and data modernization, but will be less explosive than AI servers.
3.  **Client Solutions Group (CSG):** The PC market is cyclical and mature. Growth will be tied to the **AI PC refresh cycle** (Windows 11, new processors) starting in 2026. Management noted a 3% growth in Q3 FY26, suggesting a stabilization and mild recovery.
4.  **Management Guidance:**
    *   **FY26 Revenue Guidance:** \$111.7 billion (17% growth over FY25's \$95.6B).
    *   **FY27 EPS Growth Framework:** Mid-teens EPS growth. This suggests strong net income growth, which requires both solid revenue growth and margin expansion/stability.

| Year | Basis/Justification | Revenue Growth % | Revenue (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25 (Actual)** | Actual Revenue from Q4 FY25 Report. | N/A | $95,567 |
| **FY26 (Guidance)** | Management's latest updated guidance for the full year, driven by AI server shipments against the large backlog. | +17.0% | $111,700 |
| **FY27** | High growth due to the monetization of the \$18.4B AI server backlog and continued AI PC refresh cycle gaining steam. Assumes a year of peak AI-driven revenue surge, translating mid-teens EPS to ~10% revenue growth. | +10.0% | $122,870 |
| **FY28** | As the initial AI backlog is worked through, growth moderates. CSG stabilizes its post-refresh contribution, and ISG (AI) settles into a more sustainable, yet elevated, growth rate. | +5.0% | $129,014 |
| **FY29** | Growth continues to slow toward a long-term rate, reflecting Dell's position in a maturing industry, offset by continuous demand for enterprise infrastructure (which AI has expanded). | +3.0% | $132,884 |
| **FY30** | Assumes near-market growth for a mature, diversified hardware/infrastructure provider. | +2.0% | $135,542 |

### 3. Margin Projections & Net Income

The profitability model is based on historical performance and management commentary, especially regarding AI server margins, which are cited as "mid-single digits" (lower than corporate average).

*   **Gross Margin %:** Q3 FY26 Gross Margin was 21.1%. Due to the mix shift toward lower-margin AI servers, this rate is conservatively maintained at **21.0%**.
*   **Operating Margin %:** Q3 FY26 GAAP Operating Margin was 9.3%. As the company gains scale and AI server margins improve slightly, the operating margin is conservatively projected at **9.0%** for all years.
*   **Net Income Margin % (Conservative):** Historical Net Income has been strong (\$4.5B in FY25). With a 9.0% Operating Margin, the Net Income Margin is projected at a conservative **6.0%** for all years, allowing for interest and tax expenses.

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) = A * Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25 (Actual Net Inc.)** | $95,567 | 4.8% | $4,576 |
| **FY26 (Projected)** | $111,700 | 6.0% | $6,702 |
| **FY27 (Projected)** | $122,870 | 6.0% | $7,372 |
| **FY28 (Projected)** | $129,014 | 6.0% | $7,741 |
| **FY29 (Projected)** | $132,884 | 6.0% | $7,973 |
| **FY30 (Projected)** | $135,542 | 6.0% | $8,133 |

### 4. Projected Net Income with ROIC

The instruction mandates treating Net Income as cash flow into the next year, and then calculating an additional income based on ROIC.

*   **Historical ROIC:** The TTM ROIC as of Oct 2025 was 10.72%, and the 3-year average was 9.13%.
*   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** I will use a conservative ROIC of **8.0%** to generate additional income from retained cash.

| Year | Previous Year Cash (C) | ROIC Additional Income (D) = C * 8.0% | Projected Net Income (E) = B + D |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY26** | $4,576 (FY25 Net Income) | $366 | $6,702 + $366 = $7,068 |
| **FY27** | $7,068 (FY26 Net Income) | $565 | $7,372 + $565 = $7,937 |
| **FY28** | $7,937 (FY27 Net Income) | $635 | $7,741 + $635 = $8,376 |
| **FY29** | $8,376 (FY28 Net Income) | $670 | $7,973 + $670 = $8,643 |
| **FY30** | $8,643 (FY29 Net Income) | $691 | $8,133 + $691 = $8,824 |

*Note: For the purpose of this instruction, Net Income is treated as the projected Cash Flow (FCF) available to equity holders.*

### 5. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

#### **Assumptions:**

1.  **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** I will use a conservative discount rate (e.g., WACC) of **10.0%**. This is higher than the historical WACC of 8.82% cited in search results, which accounts for the inherent volatility and risk associated with the hardware/technology industry.
2.  **Terminal Growth Rate (Conservative Maturity Rate):** A very conservative long-term growth rate of **1.5%** is used, reflecting a mature company's expected growth slightly above inflation but below GDP, as the PC/server market is mature.

#### **NPV Calculation:**

| Year (Fiscal) | Projected Cash Flow (E) (in millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 10.0%)^n) | Net Present Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY26 (n=1)** | $7,068 | 0.9091 | $6,425 |
| **FY27 (n=2)** | $7,937 | 0.8264 | $6,560 |
| **FY28 (n=3)** | $8,376 | 0.7513 | $6,293 |
| **FY29 (n=4)** | $8,643 | 0.6830 | $5,903 |
| **FY30 (n=5)** | $8,824 | 0.6209 | $5,479 |
| **Terminal Value** | $135,178 | 0.6209 | $83,924 |

**Calculation of Terminal Value (TV) at FY30:**
$$TV = \frac{CF_{FY31}}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Terminal Growth Rate}} = \frac{\$8,824 \times (1 + 1.5\%)}{10.0\% - 1.5\%} = \frac{\$8,956}{\text{8.5\%}} = \$105,365\text{ million}$$
*Correction: The calculation of the terminal value here is typically $\frac{CF_{t+1}}{(WACC - g)}$ but since the instructions use Net Income as cash flow, I will use the final cash flow for FY30, and then discount the Terminal Value by the final discount factor.*
Let's use the standard DCF Terminal Value for a conservative approach:
$$\text{TV} = \frac{CF_{\text{FY30}} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{r} - \text{g}} = \frac{\$8,824 \times (1 + 0.015)}{0.10 - 0.015} = \frac{\$8,956}{\text{0.085}} = \$105,365 \text{ million}$$

**Discounted Terminal Value (NPV of TV):**
$$NPV(TV) = \text{TV} \times (1 / (1 + \text{r})^5) = \$105,365 \times 0.6209 = \mathbf{\$65,420} \text{ million}$$

| Cash Flow Type | Sum (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sum of NPV of Forecast Period (FY26-FY30)** | $6,425 + $6,560 + $6,293 + $5,903 + $5,479 = **$30,660** |
| **NPV of Terminal Value (FY30)** | **$65,420** |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | $30,660 + $65,420 = **$96,080** |

### 6. Fair Value Calculation

$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \text{Total Enterprise Value} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$
$$\text{Fair Value of Equity} = \$96,080 \text{M} + \$11,300 \text{M} - \$28,689 \text{M} = \mathbf{\$78,691 \text{ million}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Equity}}{\text{Total Shares Outstanding}} = \frac{\$78,691 \text{M}}{672.4 \text{M shares}} = \mathbf{\$117.03}$$

## Conclusion and Market Comparison

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$117.03** |
| **Current Market Price** | **$117.49** |

The calculated Fair Value per Share of **$117.03** is nearly identical to the current market price of **$117.49**.

### Justification of Assumptions and Market Alignment

The market's current valuation of DELL is nearly identical to this conservative DCF model. This suggests that the market is making assumptions very similar to the conservative assumptions used here:

1.  **Consensus on AI Upside (Near-Term):** The market has already priced in the strong near-term revenue surge (FY26-FY27) driven by the massive AI server backlog (\$18.4 billion) and management's guidance of mid-teens EPS growth for FY27. My revenue assumptions of +17.0% (FY26) and +10.0% (FY27) are baked into the current stock price.
2.  **Conservative Long-Term Outlook:** The market views Dell as a business that, despite the AI boost, will eventually revert to the mean of a mature PC/server company. My conservative assumptions of a $10.0\%$ discount rate, a $6.0\%$ net income margin, and a low $1.5\%$ terminal growth rate, coupled with the assumption that the AI segment's growth will decelerate significantly after FY27, align almost perfectly with the market's long-term outlook for the company.
3.  **ROIC and Efficiency:** The use of an $8.0\%$ ROIC, which is conservative compared to the recent TTM ROIC of $10.72\%$, reflects a cautious view on Dell's ability to sustain high returns on capital over the long run as competition in the AI server market intensifies (e.g., from Super Micro Computer and larger ODMs). The market is similarly not giving Dell a premium for sustained, high-efficiency growth far into the future.

**In summary, the market's assumptions are that Dell will experience a significant, but ultimately temporary, boost in revenue and earnings from the current AI cycle (FY26-FY27) but will then settle back into a slow-growth, mature business model, which aligns exactly with the output of this conservative DCF model.**
