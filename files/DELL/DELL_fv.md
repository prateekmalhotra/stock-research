## II. Business Engine and Projection Rationale

### A. Revenue Projection (FY26 - FY30)

Dell's business engine is driven by two main segments: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) and the Client Solutions Group (CSG). The **core driver for future growth is the massive demand for AI-optimized servers and related networking/storage within the ISG segment**, evidenced by a \$9 billion AI server backlog as of Q4 FY25 [cite: 3 in step 3].

| Year | Revenue Rationale & Justification | Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25** | Base Year (Actual) | N/A | \$95,600 |
| **FY26** | Conservative end of management's raised guidance of \$105B - \$109B [cite: 2 in step 2]. | 9.83% | **\$105,000** |
| **FY27 - FY29** | Management's long-term guidance of 7% - 9% revenue growth, driven by AI. We use the conservative floor of **7.0%** to account for competition and cyclicality [cite: 4 in step 2]. | 7.00% | **\$112,350** |
| **FY28** | Continued conservative AI-driven growth. | 7.00% | **\$120,215** |
| **FY29** | Continued conservative AI-driven growth. | 7.00% | **\$128,630** |
| **FY30** | Tapered growth to reflect a slower, more mature pace after the initial AI ramp. | 6.00% | **\$136,348** |

### B. Net Income Margin and ROIC Projection

1.  **Net Income Margin:** Management is targeting 15%+ EPS growth, which suggests profitability improvements [cite: 4 in step 2]. However, the AI server business has recently compressed gross margins (Q2 FY26 gross margin was 18.7% due to mix shift) [cite: 2 in step 2]. I will use a **conservative, gradual margin expansion** above the FY25 GAAP net margin (3.54%), which is prudent given the competitive nature of the hardware business.

2.  **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Dell has historically carried a negative book value, making historical ROIC unrepresentative. Since the company is now generating positive net income, I will use a **conservative 8.0%** return on the accumulated cash balance (Net Income from prior years) to generate additional income in the subsequent year, as per the rules.

| Year | Net Income Margin | Revenue (USD Millions) | Net Income from Operations (A) (USD Millions) | Accumulated Cash from Prior Years (B) (USD Millions) | ROIC on Prior Cash (8.0% * B) (C) (USD Millions) | Total Projected Net Income (A + C) (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY25** | 3.54% | \$95,600 | \$3,386 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **FY26** | 3.80% | \$105,000 | \$3,990 | \$3,386 | \$271 | **\$4,261** |
| **FY27** | 4.00% | \$112,350 | \$4,494 | \$7,647 | \$612 | **\$5,106** |
| **FY28** | 4.20% | \$120,215 | \$5,049 | \$12,753 | \$1,020 | **\$6,069** |
| **FY29** | 4.35% | \$128,630 | \$5,591 | \$18,822 | \$1,506 | **\$7,097** |
| **FY30** | 4.50% | \$136,348 | \$6,136 | \$25,919 | \$2,074 | **\$8,210** |

*Note: Accumulated Cash is a running total: (Previous Year's Accumulated Cash + Previous Year's Total Projected Net Income)*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. DCF Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate** | 9.0% | A conservative and reasonably high rate to reflect risk and the company's debt-heavy structure. |
| **Maturity Rate (g)** | 2.5% | A very conservative, low perpetual growth rate, slightly above long-term inflation, for a mature technology company. |
| **Terminal Year Net Income** | \$8,210 million (FY30) | The final projected Net Income, used as the final cash flow before the perpetual growth phase. |

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (FY) | Projected Net Income (Cash Flow) (USD Millions) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | NPV of Cash Flow (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY26** | \$4,261 | 0.917 | \$3,908 |
| **FY27** | \$5,106 | 0.842 | \$4,300 |
| **FY28** | \$6,069 | 0.772 | \$4,685 |
| **FY29** | \$7,097 | 0.708 | \$5,026 |
| **FY30** | \$8,210 | 0.650 | \$5,337 |
| **Sum of NPV (FY26 - FY30)** | | | **\$23,256** |

### C. Terminal Value

Terminal Value is calculated as: $TV = \frac{CashFlow_{FY30} \times (1 + g)}{(r - g)}$

$TV = \frac{\$8,210 \times (1 + 0.025)}{(0.090 - 0.025)} = \frac{\$8,416}{\$0.065} = \$129,477$ million

NPV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value $\times$ Final Discount Factor

$NPV\_TV = \$129,477 \times 0.650 = **\$84,160** million$

### D. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sum of NPV (FY26 - FY30)** | \$23,256 |
| **NPV of Terminal Value** | \$84,160 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **\$107,416** |
| **Add: Total Cash & Equivalents** | \$6,000 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | -\$28,689 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$84,727** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 672.37 million |
| **Fair Value Per Share (Equity Value / Shares)** | **\$126.01** |

***

## IV. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value Per Share (DCF): \$126.01**

**Current Market Price: \$162.01**

The conservative DCF valuation suggests that Dell Technologies' fair value is **\$126.01 per share**, which is approximately **22% lower** than the current market price of \$162.01.

### Justification for the Discrepancy

The significant difference between the calculated Fair Value (\$126.01) and the Current Market Price (\$162.01) indicates that the market is making more optimistic assumptions about Dell's future growth and profitability than the conservative model.

The market's assumptions, which differ from this conservative valuation, are likely:

1.  **Higher Terminal Growth Rate:** The market is likely pricing in a higher long-term growth rate than the conservative **2.5%** used. Given the AI narrative, the market may believe Dell can sustain a **3.5% to 4.0%** growth rate indefinitely. If the terminal growth rate were increased to 3.5%, the Fair Value would rise to approximately \$149.80, and a 4.0% rate would push it over the current market price.
2.  **Higher Long-Term Margin:** The market may be assuming the company achieves the **15%+ EPS growth** target primarily through margin expansion rather than aggressive share count reduction. This would imply an average long-term net margin closer to **5.0% - 6.0%** (versus the projected **4.5%** in FY30), driven by the sale of higher-value, proprietary solutions in the ISG segment.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower cost of capital (Discount Rate) than the **9.0%** used here, reflecting a perceived reduction in business risk due to the multi-year AI tailwind.

This valuation is intentionally conservative by adhering strictly to the lower end of management's long-term revenue guidance, modeling only a moderate margin increase, and utilizing a conservative high discount rate and a very low perpetual growth rate. The market is pricing in the high end of Dell's strategic vision and the exponential growth of AI, suggesting investors are confident Dell's AI-driven growth can sustain a greater growth and/or profitability premium in the long term.
