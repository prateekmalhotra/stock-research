## Business Summary

Old National Bancorp (ONB) operates as a regional financial institution primarily serving consumers and small-to-mid-sized businesses across the U.S. Midwest, including Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. The core business model is straightforward: the company collects money from its customers in the form of deposits, for which it pays a low rate of interest. It then uses this pool of money to issue loans, such as home mortgages, commercial business loans, and consumer lines of credit, charging a higher interest rate. The largest source of revenue for ONB is the difference between the interest earned on loans and the interest paid on deposits. A secondary, but important, source of revenue comes from non-interest activities, such as wealth management services and various customer fees.

## Business Model Risk

The most significant near-term risk for ONB is interest rate volatility. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates quickly, the bank must increase the interest paid on deposits to prevent customers from moving their money elsewhere, which immediately shrinks the profit margin on its existing, lower-rate loans. This 'cost of funding' squeeze has historically occurred and is a current concern because higher rates increase the competition for deposits. A major long-term risk is credit risk, which escalates during economic downturns. Since the bank’s earnings rely heavily on interest payments, a widespread regional recession could cause businesses and individuals to default on loans, leading to major financial losses, as witnessed during the 2008 financial crisis. Finally, ONB faces persistent long-term threats from competition, both from larger national banks and agile financial technology (Fintech) companies that may offer superior digital services or higher returns on deposits, potentially eroding ONB's customer base over time.

## Company History

This is a detailed history of Old National Bancorp (ONB), presented in simple, jargon-free terms.

### The History of Old National Bancorp (ONB)

#### **Inception and Core Goal (1834 – Early 1900s)**

1.  **Founding a Community Anchor (1834):** The bank was first established in 1834 in Evansville, Indiana, as the Branch Bank at Evansville, making it the city's very first bank.
2.  **The Original Purpose:** The business was founded to be a true "community bank," providing essential financial services like loans and savings accounts to help the new settlement of pioneers grow and develop a local economy.
3.  **Early Innovation and Crisis:** The bank was one of the first to introduce savings accounts and provide loans to local businesses, but it faced an early "headwind" in 1837 when a large loan for the Wabash-Erie Canal project was lost due to a nationwide financial panic.
4.  **A Commitment to Stability:** Despite early setbacks, the bank built a reputation for conservative management and stability, notably being able to redeem all notes with cash during a major financial panic in 1857 while other banks closed.
5.  **A Name Change:** Over the next century, the bank operated under several names, finally being officially named Old National Bank in 1922.

#### **Navigating Headwinds and Structuring for Growth (Mid-1900s – Early 2000s)**

6.  **Surviving the Great Depression:** The bank successfully navigated the severe economic "headwind" of the Great Depression by sticking to a strategy of conservative lending practices and maintaining strong, personal relationships with its customers.
7.  **The Formation of Old National Bancorp (1982):** Old National Bancorp (ONB), a multi-bank holding company, was officially formed to prepare for future changes in banking laws, allowing the company to expand its services and reach beyond Indiana's borders.
8.  **The Consolidation Solution:** To streamline its operations and offer a consistent experience, Old National consolidated 21 different bank charters into one common system in 2001, which made its back-office operations much more efficient.
9.  **A Major Headwind – Credit Risk:** Like all banks, ONB has had to manage the challenge, or "headwind," of its loan portfolio deteriorating (meaning customers struggle to repay loans) during periods of economic slowdown.

#### **Strategic Expansion and Modernization (2009 – Present)**

10. **A Strategic Growth Plan:** Since 1982, ONB has grown largely through mergers and acquisitions, buying over 40 financial institutions to systematically expand its reach and service offerings throughout the Midwest.
11. **Expansion into the Midwest:** Key acquisitions, such as buying bank branches from Charter One and Bank of America, helped the company significantly expand its presence into states like Illinois, Kentucky, and Michigan.
12. **Innovative Digital Solution:** Recognizing the need to evolve, the company embraced "digital transformation" by investing in new technologies, including launching a new digital banking platform for small businesses in 2024 to make banking simpler and safer for customers.
13. **The Pandemic Response (Tailwind and Strategy):** During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive economic "headwind," Old National utilized its agility to help clients with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), assisting thousands of small businesses to keep their operations going.
14. **Recent Transformational Growth:** More recently, ONB completed significant mergers with banks like First Midwest Bancorp, CapStar Bank, and Bremer Bank, which dramatically increased its total assets and made it one of the largest public banking companies headquartered in the Midwest.
15. **Short-Term Headwind from Growth:** A temporary "headwind" of these large, transformative mergers is that they often cause a short-term drop in the company's stock price as investors wait to see how the two companies will successfully merge.
16. **Current Goal and Position:** Old National Bancorp’s goal remains rooted in its history: to be the premier relationship-focused community bank in the Midwest, offering a full range of financial services, including wealth management and commercial banking, while maintaining a strong commitment to ethical conduct and community service.

## Moat Analysis

The core of Old National Bancorp's (ONB) competitive advantage, or "moat," is its successful blend of large-scale regional banking with a deep-rooted, sticky community bank model.

### **The Moat and Differentiation of Old National Bancorp (ONB)**

1.  **"Community Bank DNA" with Regional Scale:** ONB's primary differentiator is that it operates with the personalized, relationship-focused service model of a community bank while possessing the financial strength and expanded capabilities of a large regional bank (a top 30 U.S. bank). This combination makes it different from smaller local banks (which lack scale) and larger national banks (which lack local focus).

2.  **Peer-Leading, Low-Cost Deposit Base:** The company has a significant structural advantage in its ability to attract and retain low-cost, high-quality deposits. These stable, inexpensive sources of funding are a crucial component of a bank's profitability and are difficult for competitors to replicate quickly.

3.  **Sticky and Recurring Customer Relationships:** Customer stickiness comes from the emphasis on long-standing, personal relationships with individuals and businesses in the local communities it serves. This "old fashioned, basic banking" approach, combined with services like Wealth Management (its "1834" division) and Treasury Management, ensures clients consolidate multiple financial products, leading to recurring, multi-product relationships.

4.  **Conservative Risk Management and Stability:** The bank operates with a conservative approach to risk, strong underwriting practices, and a robust capital/liquidity position. This financial stability helped it successfully navigate the 2023 banking industry liquidity event without needing to make fundamental changes, reinforcing trust—a key non-financial moat in banking.

---

### **Pricing Power and Special Position**

1.  **Indirect Pricing Power via Funding Costs:** While banking products like loans and checking accounts are highly competitive, ONB’s "low-cost deposit franchise" provides an indirect form of pricing power. Lower funding costs mean the bank can offer competitive loan rates while still maintaining a better profit margin (Net Interest Margin) than rivals with more expensive funding sources.

2.  **Special Market Position in the Midwest:** The company carved out a special position by being the largest bank holding company headquartered in Indiana and expanding strategically across the Midwest and parts of the Southeast. Its multi-decade strategy of growth through mergers allowed it to acquire strong local market shares, which is difficult for an outsider to challenge.

---

### **Growth, Displacement Risk, and Innovation**

1.  **Reason for Growth (The "Better Together" Strategy):** The company's significant growth into a regional powerhouse was achieved through a disciplined history of strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This **inorganic growth** strategy, summarized by its "Better Together" mantra, combined complementary regional banks (like First Midwest Bancorp and Bremer Bank) to gain immediate scale, market reach, and enhanced capabilities.

2.  **Ease of Displacement by Capital-Rich Competitors:** Displacement is not easy, even by larger, capital-rich national banks. The main defense is the **high switching cost** and **trust** built from decades of community relationships. While a competitor can throw capital at technology, they cannot instantly replicate the deep, multi-generational trust and local connections that ONB has with small businesses and individuals. ONB is large enough to compete on technology and price, but its community focus makes it a **hard-to-replicate local incumbent.**

3.  **Network Effects:** ONB benefits from a localized version of a **reputation network effect**. As it becomes the premier, most trusted bank in a community (evidenced by extensive community investment), it attracts more local businesses and high-quality deposit clients, which further enhances its stability and attracts more top banking talent. This local reputation becomes a powerful, self-reinforcing competitive loop.

4.  **Investment in R&D and Innovation:** The bank is not a high R&D business like a pharmaceutical or tech company. It does not need to constantly innovate entirely new products to maintain its edge. However, it **does** need to invest heavily in modernizing its digital capabilities to meet customer expectations and improve efficiency. The company is doing this through a partnership with an IT firm (Infosys) and by creating an internal "Transformation Factory" for process automation, which is their version of competitive technology investment.

## Catalyst Analysis

Old National Bancorp (ONB) has several catalysts, both short-term and long-term, that could drive an increase in its stock price, largely stemming from successful merger integration and strong capital management.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (The Next 6-12 Months)**

1.  **Completion of Major Merger Integrations:**
    The successful systems conversion of the recent acquisitions, particularly Bremer Bank, eliminates merger-related costs and allows the company to fully realize the cost savings and revenue synergies. Management stated that with the Bremer conversion complete, Old National is "exceptionally well positioned" for the remainder of the year and beyond.

2.  **Increased Capital Return to Shareholders:**
    A strong capital position, including a robust CET1 ratio (over 11%), has allowed for the repurchase of common stock, which directly benefits shareholders by reducing the share count. Management highlighted that strong profitability is generating significant capital, which "opened the door for capital return."

3.  **Improving Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Net Interest Income (NII):**
    The bank anticipates stable to improving Net Interest Margins and positive operating leverage. This improvement is expected to be driven by asset repricing, organic growth, and the full impact of recent acquisitions flowing through the financials.

4.  **Tangible Book Value (TBV) Growth and AOCI Improvement:**
    The bank has consistently reported strong growth in tangible common book value per share. Management also projects that Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), which impacts book value, will improve by a significant amount by the end of 2026.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Beyond 12 Months)**

1.  **Top-Quartile Profitability and Efficiency:**
    Management's core strategy is to maintain a top-quartile adjusted return profile, targeting a high Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (ROATCE) (e.g., 20% in Q3 2025) and an adjusted efficiency ratio of below 50%. This focus on profitability and disciplined expense control is a long-term value driver.

2.  **Growth in High-Value Markets (Southeastern Expansion):**
    The CapStar and Bremer integrations have strategically expanded the bank's presence into high-growth Southeastern markets like Nashville and others, positioning it for long-term organic growth. Management has noted the positive economic growth in the Tennessee market, where the company continues to invest.

3.  **Focus on Core Deposit and Fee Income Growth:**
    The explicit management strategy is to "drive organic deposit growth to fund our asset generation," which strengthens the balance sheet with lower-cost funding. Additionally, growing fee income businesses and treasury management contribute to a more diversified and sustainable revenue stream.

4.  **Maintaining a Strong Credit and Risk Profile:**
    Management has repeatedly stated confidence in the credit outlook, citing low net charge-offs and a conservative approach to client selection. A continued track record of stable credit quality and a well-reserved loan book reduces risk and enhances investor confidence over the long term.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Old National Bancorp's (ONB) management incentive and compensation practices, primarily from its recent proxy statements, here is an assessment of their alignment with shareholder interests:

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Old National Bancorp (ONB)**

#### **I. Insider Ownership (Alignment Signal)**

1.  **Low Individual Ownership Percentage:** While all directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own a portion of the company's stock, the CEO's direct ownership is approximately 0.21%, and no individual director or executive officer is known to own more than 5% of the common stock.
2.  **Focus on Guidelines over High Stakes:** This low individual ownership percentage suggests that the personal wealth of the management team is not overwhelmingly tied up in the stock, which is a common characteristic for large, publicly-traded banks. Therefore, incentives must rely more heavily on compensation structure and policies rather than sheer ownership stake.

#### **II. Compensation Structure (Pay Mix)**

1.  **Heavy Reliance on Variable Pay:** The executive compensation structure is strongly weighted toward performance-based awards rather than fixed salary, as illustrated by the CEO's pay mix being only about 16.1% salary and 83.9% variable compensation (bonuses, stock, and options).
2.  **Alignment with Shareholder Goals:** This high percentage of variable compensation ensures that a substantial portion of an executive's total pay is at risk and dependent on the company achieving pre-defined business and financial goals, which fundamentally aligns their financial interests with the company's performance.

#### **III. Performance Metrics (Incentive Quality)**

1.  **Annual Incentive Focus (Short-Term):** The Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (AICP) for Named Executive Officers for 2024 was based on the **sole metric of Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)**, with payouts ranging from 50% to 200% of target.
2.  **Long-Term Incentive Focus (Multi-Year):** The Long-Term Incentive Plan utilizes awards in the form of **ROATCE Performance Units (Return on Average Tangible Common Equity)**, which measures profitability relative to the equity and tangible assets of the company, a key driver of shareholder value in banking.
3.  **Balanced Approach to Value Creation:** The combination of Adjusted EPS for short-term and ROATCE for long-term incentives directs management to both grow core earnings and manage capital efficiency, creating a solid focus on value creation for shareholders.

#### **IV. Corporate Governance & Risk Mitigation**

1.  **Stock Ownership Requirements:** The compensation program includes formal **stock ownership guidelines** for executives, requiring them to hold a multiple of their base salary in Company stock, reinforcing a long-term perspective.
2.  **Bonus Recoupment (Clawbacks):** A **bonus recoupment policy** (clawback) is in place, which is a critical governance tool designed to provide a strong incentive for executives to manage the Company with a long-term view and avoid excessive short-term risk-taking.
3.  **Targeted Peer-Median Pay:** Target total compensation opportunities are generally set at approximately the median of the company's peer group, suggesting a competitive but not excessive compensation philosophy.

### **Conclusion**

**Old National Bancorp's management has a clear and structured incentive to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

The conclusion is supported by the following:
*   The overwhelming majority of executive pay is **variable and at-risk** (e.g., 83.9% for the CEO), directly tying compensation to performance.
*   The primary incentive metrics (**Adjusted EPS** and **ROATCE**) are **financial measures directly linked to shareholder value** and efficient capital deployment, reducing the incentive to "line their own pockets" through non-value-additive actions.
*   Strong governance mechanisms, including **stock ownership guidelines** and a **clawback policy**, are in place to encourage a long-term focus and discourage imprudent risk-taking.

While insider ownership by managers and directors as a group is likely not a large percentage, the *structure* of the compensation is appropriately designed to align management's financial rewards with the sustained financial success experienced by shareholders.

## Long Thesis

Old National Bancorp is becoming one of the most profitable and efficient regional banks in the Midwest. Its primary advantage is its deep community roots, which secure stable, low-cost customer deposits—a cheap source of funding that guarantees better profit margins. The stock will rise in the near term as the bank finishes merging its recent large acquisitions, like Bremer Bank. This completion will unlock massive cost savings and efficiency gains, making the bank much more profitable. Long-term, ONB will leverage its new, larger size to drive strong loan growth in growing markets while continuing to return extra capital to shareholders through stock buybacks, establishing itself as a top-performing financial institution.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

1. Management successfully completes the full merging of all recent acquired banks (like Bremer and CapStar) on time and without losing too many customers, achieving all promised cost savings. 2. The regional economy in the Midwest and Southeast remains stable, preventing a spike in loan defaults or borrower bankruptcies (credit risk). 3. The bank successfully maintains its primary advantage: keeping the interest rates it pays on customer deposits low, which is crucial for its profit margins (Net Interest Margin). 4. ONB's conservative risk management style is maintained, allowing them to continue growing their loan portfolio without sacrificing credit quality.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several faults and potential holes in the long thesis, primarily centered around execution risk, macroeconomic headwinds, and the fragility of key financial assumptions.

## **Bear Case: Old National Bancorp (ONB) - Flaws in the Long Thesis**

The bull case significantly understates the near-term risks and long-term competitive pressures facing Old National Bancorp. The assumption of a smooth, immediate, and highly profitable integration process is overly optimistic, while deteriorating credit metrics and deposit cost pressure threaten core profit margins.

### **Critique of the Long Thesis & Assumptions**

1.  **Faulty Assumption on Near-Term Integration and Efficiency (Assumption 1):**
    *   The promise of *near-term* massive cost savings is contradicted by the reality of ongoing integration costs; CapStar and Bremer integrations are still incurring millions in merger-related charges, and the large Bremer system conversion was scheduled for mid-October 2025, meaning the highest period of disruption and expense is current or immediate, not *finished*.
    *   The total one-time merger expenses for the Bremer deal alone are projected at a substantial $194 million pre-tax, which will directly reduce near-term reported earnings and consume capital that could otherwise be returned to shareholders.
    *   Acquisitions of this scale inherently carry significant execution risk, including the potential for greater-than-expected customer attrition from the acquired banks (Bremer and CapStar), which directly threatens the expected revenue synergies and deposit base growth.

2.  **Pressure on Core Profit Margin from Rising Deposit Costs (Assumption 3):**
    *   The assumption of maintaining "stable, low-cost customer deposits" is challenged by recent trends, as the bank's cost of total deposits has experienced volatility, rising by 9 basis points in Q3 2024 and then increasing again in Q3 2025, reflecting persistent competitive pressure in the high-interest rate environment.
    *   This trend suggests that the bank's "cheap source of funding" advantage is eroding under competition for deposits, causing the Net Interest Margin (NIM) to experience modest decreases in late 2024, which puts a ceiling on profit margin expansion.

3.  **Deteriorating Credit Quality and Understated Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Risk (Assumptions 2 & 4):**
    *   The "conservative risk management" claim is tested by an increase in credit risk metrics; 30+ day delinquencies and nonaccrual loans have seen a noticeable upward trend in late 2024, indicating early signs of credit quality deterioration.
    *   The loan portfolio remains vulnerable to potential downturns in the Commercial Real Estate market due to elevated interest rates and changing economic patterns, a risk acknowledged by the planned sale of a significant amount of CRE loans post-Bremer deal.

4.  **Inconsistent Capital Return and Limited Loan Growth Potential:**
    *   The long-term case relies on the bank "continuing to return extra capital to shareholders through stock buybacks," yet the company failed to execute its authorized repurchase program in 2023 due to market conditions, proving that buybacks are discretionary and not a guaranteed source of shareholder return.
    *   Management itself anticipates loan growth to be at the lower end of its projected range due to heightened competition, which challenges the expectation of "strong loan growth" in an environment where the bank must also sell off assets to manage portfolio risk.

***

## **Bear Case Thesis for Old National Bancorp (ONB)**

**Old National Bancorp is an expensive stock whose near-term earnings will be weighed down by massive, prolonged merger-related costs and whose long-term profitability is compromised by rising funding costs and subtle, yet persistent, credit quality erosion.**

The company's focus on large-scale M&A over pure organic growth presents a high execution risk, diverting management attention and capital to integration rather than core banking functions.

1.  **Integration Overhang & Cost Bloat:** The CapStar and especially the Bremer acquisitions represent a major digestion period. Near-term adjusted earnings will be pressured by significant, one-time merger charges, challenging the bullish narrative of an immediate "unlocking" of savings and creating an overhang of execution risk until the very large system conversion is completed and synergies fully materialize.
2.  **Net Interest Margin (NIM) Compression:** The highly competitive deposit environment is forcing up ONB's cost of funds, which will continue to place downward pressure on its Net Interest Margin, making it difficult for the bank to achieve the superior, guaranteed profit margins promised by the thesis.
3.  **Credit Deterioration Risk:** While management calls credit "resilient," the measurable increase in nonaccrual loans and delinquencies, coupled with a notable vulnerability to the struggling Commercial Real Estate (CRE) segment, suggests a rising probability of higher loan loss provisions in future quarters, further depressing earnings and challenging the "conservative" risk profile.
