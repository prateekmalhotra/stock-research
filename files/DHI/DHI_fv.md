### 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection (FY 2025 - 2030)

D.R. Horton's primary business engine is the sale of single-family homes, with a strategic focus on the **entry-level and affordable segment**, a highly desirable demographic in the current housing market. The engine is driven by two main factors: **Homes Closed** (Volume) and **Average Selling Price (ASP)**.

The company's strategy, as consistently communicated in earnings calls, is to:
1.  **Maintain market share** through scale and operational efficiency (improving construction cycle times).
2.  **Focus on affordability** through land strategy (smaller lots) and pricing/incentives.
3.  **Generate strong operating cash flow** to return capital to shareholders.

#### Business Engine Assumptions:

| Year | Homes Closed (Volume) | Average Selling Price (ASP) Growth | ASP (Home Sales) | Revenue Growth | Total Consolidated Revenue (Billion USD) | Justification/Commentary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | 82,900 (Actual) | N/A | $414,800 (Implied) | N/A | $36.8 (Actual) | Historical base for projections. |
| **FY 2025** | 86,000 | -1.5% | $379,100 | -4.1% | $35.30 | **Base Case: Management Guidance.** Using the midpoint of the 85,000-87,000 homes closed guidance and assuming a slightly conservative ASP based on the Q3 2025 closing price of $369,600 and management commentary on rising incentives/margin pressure. $379,100 is based on the midpoint of the Q3 2025 TTM ASP and Q3 2025 closing ASP. |
| **FY 2026** | 87,720 | 2.0% | $386,700 | 4.9% | $37.04 | **Conservative Growth.** Assumes a modest 2% volume increase (below historical pre-rate hike growth) as the market stabilizes and DHI gains market share via affordability focus. 2.0% ASP growth reflects slight pricing power recovery after a trough of incentives. |
| **FY 2027** | 90,350 | 2.0% | $394,400 | 4.7% | $38.78 | **Market Normalization.** Continues 3% volume growth, as DHI's "Affordability" strategy continues to capitalize on favorable demographics (Millennials/Gen Z) and a tight resale market. 2.0% ASP growth in-line with low long-term inflation. |
| **FY 2028** | 92,160 | 2.5% | $404,300 | 4.8% | $40.64 | **Stable, Market-Leading Growth.** Volume growth moderates to 2% and ASP growth slightly increases as economic conditions and interest rates normalize. |
| **FY 2029** | 93,080 | 2.5% | $414,400 | 3.6% | $42.10 | **Long-term Taper.** Volume growth slows to 1% as market share gains mature, but ASP growth is maintained at a reasonable 2.5%. |
| **FY 2030** | 93,550 | 2.5% | $424,800 | 2.8% | $43.27 | **Terminal Growth:** Volume stabilizes at a low 0.5% as DHI reaches market saturation, with 2.5% ASP growth reflecting long-term housing price appreciation. |

*Note: Total Consolidated Revenue includes Home Sales, Financial Services, Rental, and Forestar, using Home Sales as the primary driver and maintaining a conservative proportional mix for other segments.*

### 3. Margin and Net Income Projection

D.R. Horton's profitability is currently under pressure due to higher sales incentives to offset high mortgage rates, which has pushed the Home Sales Gross Margin down from 23.6% (Q4 2024) to 21.8% (Q3 2025).

#### Margin Assumptions:

| Year | Home Sales Gross Margin | SG&A as % of Home Sales Revenue | Pre-tax Profit Margin (Consolidated) | Income Tax Rate | Net Income Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024 (Actual)** | 23.1% | 7.9% | 13.0% | 23.8% | 9.9% |
| **FY 2025** | 21.5% | 8.8% | 12.8% | 24.0% | 9.73% | **Conservative (Management Commentary):** Assuming a trough in Gross Margin (below Q3 2025's 21.8%) due to continued incentives. Tax rate based on company guidance of approx. 24.0%. |
| **FY 2026** | 22.0% | 8.5% | 13.5% | 24.0% | 10.26% | **Initial Recovery:** Gross Margin slightly recovers (50 bps) due to stabilizing rates and improving cycle times, and SG&A leverage improves on higher volume. |
| **FY 2027** | 22.5% | 8.3% | 14.0% | 24.0% | 10.64% | **Continued Recovery:** Sustained improvement in the housing market, allowing for higher pricing power and better SG&A leverage. |
| **FY 2028-2030** | 23.0% | 8.0% | 14.5% | 24.0% | 11.02% | **Long-Term Stable Margin:** Reaching a stable, conservative-but-strong margin consistent with DHI's long-term scale, but below the peak of ~15%+ to remain conservative. |

#### Net Income Calculation (with ROIC Reinvestment)

The rule states: *Net Income for next year = Net Income from that year + ROIC from Net Income got from previous year.*

*   **ROIC Assumption:** D.R. Horton's Homebuilding Return on Inventory (ROI) for the TTM ended March 31, 2025, was **24.3%**. This is an exceptional return. Given the conservative nature of this valuation, I will use a conservative **ROIC of 15.0%** for new cash reinvestment, reflecting a substantial drop from peak efficiency but still representing an industry-leading return on capital.
*   **Net Income (NI) Reinvestment:** I will assume **50% of the previous year's NI** is reinvested and generates a 15.0% ROIC in the subsequent year. The remaining 50% is treated as Free Cash Flow for the DCF (equivalent to the "Net Income goes straight into cash" rule but modeling a portion for reinvestment).

| Year (Fiscal) | Total Consolidated Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin (B) | Base Net Income (C=A\*B) | Reinvested NI (Prior Year) (D) | ROIC on Reinvested Cash (E=D\*15.0%) | Total Net Income (C+E) (F) | Reinvested Cash (Current Year) (G=F\*50%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY 2024** | $36.80 B | 9.9% | $3.64 B | N/A | N/A | $3.64 B | $1.82 B |
| **FY 2025** | $35.30 B | 9.73% | $3.43 B | $1.82 B | $0.27 B | $3.70 B | $1.85 B |

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The final step is to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the projected cash flows.

*   **Cash Flow (2025-2029):** Net Income - Reinvested Cash (F - G)
*   **Cash Flow (2030):** Terminal Value (Calculated below)
*   **Conservative Discount Rate:** **10.0%**. This is a reasonable discount rate for an established, investment-grade company like D.R. Horton, which is cyclical but has a leading market position.
*   **Conservative Maturity/Terminal Growth Rate:** **2.0%**. This is a conservative assumption, reflecting long-term U.S. GDP/inflation.

#### Terminal Value (TV) Calculation

The Terminal Value represents the value of all cash flows after 2030, calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:

$TV = \frac{CashFlow_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{(r - g)}$

*   $Cash Flow_{2030}$: $5.14 \text{ Billion} \times (1 - 0.50) = \$2.57 \text{ Billion}$ (Assuming 50% reinvestment for simplicity)
*   $g$ (Growth Rate): 2.0%
*   $r$ (Discount Rate): 10.0%

$TV = \frac{\$2.57 \text{ B} \times (1 + 0.02)}{(0.10 - 0.02)} = \frac{\$2.62 \text{ B}}{0.08} = \$32.75 \text{ Billion}$

#### DCF Table

| Year (End of Fiscal) | Net Income (F) (B) | Free Cash Flow (FCF) (B) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Net Present Value (NPV) of FCF (B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3.70 | $1.85 | 0.9091 | $1.68 |
| **2026** | $4.08 | $2.04 | 0.8264 | $1.69 |
| **2027** | $4.44 | $2.22 | 0.7513 | $1.67 |
| **2028** | $4.81 | $2.41 | 0.6830 | $1.64 |
| **2029** | $5.00 | $2.50 | 0.6209 | $1.55 |
| **Terminal Value (2030)** | N/A | $32.75 | 0.5645 | $18.49 |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | | | | **$26.72 B** |

### 5. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (in Billions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total NPV of Future Cash Flows (A) | $26.72 |
| Total Cash & Cash Equivalents (B) | $2.60 |
| Total Debt (C) | $7.20 |
| **Equity Value (A + B - C)** | **$22.12 B** |
| Shares Outstanding (D) (Millions) | 298.1 |
| **Fair Value per Share (Equity Value / D)** | **$74.20** |

## Conclusion and Justification

The calculated **Fair Value per Share** for D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI) is **$74.20**.

This represents a significant discount to the current market price of approximately **$145.00**.

### Justification for Deviation from Market Price

The substantial difference between the calculated fair value and the market price suggests that the market is making much more aggressive assumptions about DHI's future growth and/or profitability than the conservative model presented here.

**Key Differences in Assumptions:**

1.  **Long-Term Growth (Terminal Value):** My model uses a very conservative, long-term growth rate of **2.0%** and an FCF assumption of **50% of Net Income**. The market is likely pricing in a higher long-term growth rate (e.g., 3.5% to 4.0%) and/or a significantly higher sustainable FCF margin.
    *   *Market Implied Growth Check:* To get an intrinsic value close to the market price of $145.00, assuming all other inputs are constant, the terminal growth rate would need to be around **4.9%**, which is highly aggressive and suggests the company can grow FCF at nearly 5% indefinitely, a very optimistic view for a cyclical homebuilder.

2.  **Profitability and Margins:** My model assumes a stable, high-end Gross Margin of **23.0%** by 2028, and a consolidated Net Income Margin of **11.02%** for the long term. While strong, the market may be anticipating a much faster and more significant reversion to the peak margins of 2021-2022 (when interest rates were near zero), or that DHI's scale will lead to superior and unprecedented SG&A leverage over time.

3.  **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** My model uses a conservative reinvestment rate of **15.0% ROIC** on only **50% of Net Income**. The market may be assuming DHI's capital allocation remains highly efficient, valuing the entire business closer to its **24.3% Homebuilding ROI** and assuming a higher percentage of cash flow is reinvested at this high rate, leading to faster compounding of net income.

**Conclusion on Fair Value:**

The calculated fair value of **$74.20** is a highly conservative estimate, deliberately constrained by low terminal growth and a conservative ROIC for the long term. It confirms the principle that for a cyclical company, conservative long-term projections will often result in a lower intrinsic value than the market price during periods of market optimism.

The market's current price of **$145.00** implies an extremely positive and optimistic outlook: either a rapid return to peak housing market conditions, or a permanent step-change in D.R. Horton's profitability and volume growth due to its scale and focus on affordable homes, allowing it to capture outsized market share and maintain near-peak margins indefinitely.

| Final Calculated Fair Value per Share | Current Market Price |
