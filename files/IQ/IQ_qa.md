## Business Summary

iQIYI operates as a leading online video streaming service primarily serving consumers in Mainland China. The core business model is centered on Membership Services, where subscribers pay a recurring fee for access to a large library of licensed and original entertainment content. Revenue is heavily supplemented by Online Advertising Services, where businesses pay to market products to the large user base, and by Content Distribution, where iQIYI licenses its original shows to third parties. The company's operational success depends entirely on continuously investing in high-quality, exclusive content to attract and retain paying subscribers.

## Business Model Risk

A major near-term risk is the intense and expensive competition within the Chinese streaming industry, mainly from rivals like Tencent Video and Youku, which leads to content bidding wars and pressure to keep subscription prices low, directly hurting profitability; this persistent competition has historically kept iQIYI from achieving consistent earnings. A critical long-term risk is the restrictive and unpredictable nature of content regulation by the Chinese government, as authorities can abruptly censor popular shows or halt the release of high-budget productions, causing large revenue losses. Furthermore, the massive fixed cost of producing high-quality original content requires continuous cash outflow, making the business highly vulnerable if subscriber growth slows or advertising revenue declines.

## Company History

This is a detailed history lesson of iQIYI, Inc. (IQ), the major Chinese online video streaming platform.

### **iQIYI, Inc. History: From Inception to Present**

#### **I. Inception and Founding Purpose**

1.  **Founding and Initial Backing:** The company was initially established in January 2010 and launched in April 2010 as Qiyi.com by internet entrepreneur Dr. Gong Yu, with significant financial backing from the major Chinese technology company, Baidu, Inc.
2.  **The Core Goal:** The business was founded to establish a high-quality, professional streaming service in China's rapidly growing online video market. The name itself, which changed to iQIYI in 2011, combines the 'i' for internet with *Qiyi* (奇艺), meaning "love art" in Chinese, which perfectly reflected their aim to offer entertainment-focused content.
3.  **The Early Strategy:** The platform started with a **freemium model**, offering a wide variety of licensed video content for free, primarily generating revenue through advertisements shown to users. This strategy quickly helped them attract a massive number of users and gain an early foothold in the market.
4.  **Long-Term Vision:** iQIYI's stated mission is to become a technology-based media company that uses continuous technological innovation and outstanding content to bring fun and joy to people and their families.

#### **II. Tailwinds (Favorable Market Forces)**

5.  **Backing of a Tech Giant:** Having the support of Baidu, which is often called the "Google of China," was a crucial early tailwind, providing initial funding, technological resources, and a massive existing user base for promotion and integration.
6.  **Massive Market Size:** iQIYI benefited greatly from the sheer scale and rapid growth of the Chinese digital entertainment and internet market, which is one of the largest in the world.
7.  **The Streaming Revolution:** The global and domestic shift of users from traditional television to on-demand, online video streaming was a major industry tailwind that fueled the company’s expansion.
8.  **Public Capital Injection:** A significant milestone was the company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2018, which raised over \$2 billion in capital. This money was essential for acquiring expensive content licenses and investing heavily in original production and technology.

#### **III. Headwinds (Problems and Challenges)**

9.  **Intense Competition:** The company has constantly faced fierce rivalry from domestic competitors like Tencent Video and Youku Tudou (owned by Alibaba), requiring massive and continuous spending on content to keep up.
10. **The Cost of Content:** For many years, a major challenge was the huge financial burden of constantly licensing popular movies and TV shows, coupled with the high cost of producing their own original content, which often resulted in the company operating at a loss.
11. **The Rise of Short-Form Video:** In recent years, iQIYI has had to contend with the immense popularity of short-form video platforms (like Douyin, known internationally as TikTok), which have captured a large portion of users' online time and attention.
12. **The Regulatory Environment:** Operating in China means navigating a complex and often evolving government regulatory environment concerning media content and internet platform operations.

#### **IV. Innovative Solutions and Strategies**

13. **The Pivot to Original Content:** To differentiate itself and control its content costs, iQIYI made a major strategic shift to invest heavily in self-produced, high-quality content like original dramas and variety shows, many of which became cultural phenomena. This created *exclusive* content that subscribers could only find on their platform.
14. **Pioneering the Subscription Model:** The company successfully transitioned the Chinese market toward accepting and paying for premium online video content through its VIP subscription service, helping to establish a more stable, recurring revenue stream instead of relying only on advertising.
15. **Harnessing AI and Technology:** iQIYI uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data to drive its business, including sophisticated recommendation algorithms to personalize the user experience and keep people watching longer. They also use AI to improve the efficiency of content production, reducing costs and shortening the time it takes to create new shows.
16. **Strategic Content Expansion:** To compete with short-form platforms, iQIYI developed and aggressively promoted a portfolio of mini-dramas and short-form content, which are short, mobile-optimized episodes that appeal to users looking for quick entertainment.
17. **Achieving Sustainable Profitability:** A key recent solution has been a sharp focus on business efficiency and cost management, which led the company to achieve its first full year of operating profit in 2023, signaling a crucial shift towards sustainable, long-term growth.
18. **Diversifying Beyond the Screen:** The company is now exploring new revenue sources by leveraging its successful original content *Intellectual Property* (IP) through an offline business, including self-operated consumer products like collectible trading cards and innovative, tech-focused "iQIYI Land" theme parks. This moves the company from being a pure streaming service to a broader entertainment ecosystem.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of iQIYI, Inc. is built upon a combination of exclusive content, a massive established user base, and strategic technological innovation in a highly competitive and capital-intensive market.

### Analysis of iQIYI's Moat and Competitive Advantage

#### **1. Differentiated Product and Market Position**

*   **Premium Original Content (HBO-like Strategy):** iQIYI differentiates itself by consistently investing heavily in creating high-quality, exclusive original content, such as premium dramas and variety shows, a strategy often compared to that of HBO in the West. This focus on in-house production gives the company full control over its Intellectual Property (IP), making its content unique and unavailable on competing platforms.
*   **"Long + Short" Content Strategy:** To adapt to new trends and compete with short-form platforms, iQIYI is uniquely integrating long-form content (like TV series) with short-form content (like micro-dramas). This dual-format approach caters to both "binge-watchers" and mobile users looking for quick, bite-sized entertainment, broadening its appeal and securing a leading position in the evolving Chinese streaming market.
*   **Brand Positioning and Core Audience:** The company has successfully cultivated a brand image centered on "quality, youth, and fashion," allowing it to capture and retain a significant base of young, high-value users. This clear brand identity helps it stand out against general-purpose competitors.

#### **2. Special Pricing Power and Customer Stickiness**

*   **Demonstrated Pricing Power:** iQIYI has shown it possesses a degree of pricing power by successfully implementing multiple membership fee increases since 2020. The continued growth in its membership services revenue (up 15% year-over-year in 2023) indicates a growing user willingness to pay for premium, exclusive content.
*   **Sticky and Recurring Customer Contracts:** The vast majority of iQIYI's customers are on subscription-based membership plans, which generate stable, recurring revenue. This subscription model incentivizes the company to focus on customer retention through constant content updates and an enhanced user experience, increasing "stickiness."
*   **Ecosystem Stickiness (IP Integration):** The company is expanding the universe of its hit shows by creating an Intellectual Property (IP) ecosystem that extends beyond the screen. This involves launching IP-based merchandise, collectibles, and even offline experiences like immersive theaters and "iQIYI Land" theme parks, which strengthens customer loyalty and creates new revenue streams.

#### **3. Network Effects and Displacement Risk**

*   **Network Effects from Content:** While not a traditional social network, a form of network effect exists where popular original content attracts a large audience. This large and engaged audience, in turn, attracts more top-tier content creators and advertisers to the platform, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces its market leadership.
*   **Defense Against Capital-Rich Competitors:** The business is indeed capital-intensive due to the high cost of content production and competition from giants like Tencent Video and Youku (backed by Alibaba). However, iQIYI's established defenses make it hard to displace easily:
    *   **Scale and Brand:** Its massive base of over 400 million monthly active users and over 100 million paying subscribers provides a substantial barrier to entry for any new competitor.
    *   **Content Library and Production System:** The sheer size of its licensed and original content library, combined with its proprietary data-driven production system for managing content creation, is a long-term asset that cannot be replicated quickly, even with significant capital.

#### **4. Innovation and R&D Investment**

*   **High R&D Investment for Edge:** The company invests significant capital in research and development (RMB 412.5 million in Q1 2025) and must constantly innovate to maintain its competitive edge against fast-moving rivals.
*   **Technology as a Moat Builder:** iQIYI uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data to improve its services, which directly contributes to its moat. Examples include sophisticated recommendation algorithms for personalized viewing and tools like "I Jump," which uses AI to allow viewers to skip directly to highlights in long-form videos, enhancing user experience and retention.

5.  **Growth in Content Distribution Revenue:** The company has seen significant sequential growth in content distribution revenue, driven by an increased volume of distributed titles, which can provide a near-term boost to overall revenue.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (Strategic initiatives for sustained growth)**

3.  **AI Integration for Efficiency and Revenue:** The company is leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the user experience and support revenue diversification, including integrating Generative AI into its advertising platform to enhance return-on-investment (ROI) for advertisers.
4.  **IP Monetization and "Experience Business":** A key long-term strategy is to leverage its intellectual property (IP) by transitioning hit shows into consumer products, offline experiences, and immersive theaters (the "Experience Business"), which is designed to unlock new growth beyond the screen.
5.  **Global Expansion:** International expansion is cited as a strategic priority, with a focus on increasing investment to scale local content and operations in key overseas markets like Brazil and Indonesia, with membership revenue in these markets expected to grow significantly.

He also emphasized the strategy of maintaining the No. 1 position in the drama market share with blockbuster releases and significant progress in mini-dramas.
*   **CFO Jun Wang on Financial Health:** The CFO highlighted that "the result of our efforts to optimize the capital structure is very clear," which indicates a focus on maintaining a healthy financial position to support growth initiatives.
*   **Chief Content Officer Xiaohui Wang on Content Strategy:** The content strategy is shifting to focus on "releasing high-quality shorter episodes of premium dramas" along with increasing the overall quantity and diversity of titles to better appeal to users.

## Management Incentive

Based on the review of iQIYI, Inc.'s Form 20-F filings (the equivalent of a DEF 14A for foreign private issuers), the following analysis of management incentive and compensation is provided.

### **I. Insider Ownership and Corporate Control**

1.  **Low Executive Voting Power:** The beneficial ownership of iQIYI's shares by all directors and executive officers as a group is relatively low, holding approximately 5.5% of the Class A ordinary shares as of December 31, 2023. Crucially, this group's combined voting power is less than 1% of the total, due to the dual-class share structure.
2.  **Dominant Principal Shareholder:** Control is highly concentrated with Baidu, Inc., which holds 100% of the high-voting Class B ordinary shares. This results in Baidu possessing a dominant **89.2%** of the total voting power, meaning Baidu effectively controls all matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors.
3.  **Governance Risk:** iQIYI operates as a foreign private issuer and is therefore exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance rules, such as the requirement for CEO compensation to be determined *solely* by independent directors. This structure, combined with Baidu's control, implies a lower level of corporate governance protection for minority shareholders.

### **II. Management Compensation Structure**

1.  **Mix of Compensation:** The compensation for executive officers includes both a **cash component** (salary and annual bonuses) and an **equity component** (share-based awards).
2.  **Equity-Based Incentives:** The company utilizes a share incentive plan to grant stock options and Restricted Share Units (RSUs) to directors, executive officers, and employees, stating this is to "attract and retain key personnel." This links a portion of executive compensation to the long-term appreciation of the company's share price (Class A shares/ADSs), which benefits public shareholders.
3.  **Compensation Oversight:** The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the long-term incentive compensation, equity plans, programs, and annual bonuses. However, the committee's composition has recently included a Baidu Chief Financial Officer as the new chairman and a Baidu Director of Compensation and Benefits as a new member, further aligning incentive design with the controlling shareholder's perspective.

### **III. Conclusion on Shareholder Alignment**

The primary incentive to act in the interest of shareholders is complex and split:

1.  **Incentive for Value Creation:** The use of **equity-based awards** for management provides a direct financial incentive for them to improve operational performance and increase the overall value of the company's stock (Class A shares). This generally aligns the economic interests of the management team with all shareholders.
2.  **Incentive to Serve Controlling Shareholder:** The overwhelming **89.2% voting power** held by Baidu means that the management team is ultimately incentivized to act in the interests of Baidu, which has the power to elect and remove the board and approve all major decisions.
3.  **Overall Conclusion:** Management has a sufficient incentive to grow the company's value due to their equity holdings. However, in any situation where the interests of the controlling shareholder (Baidu) diverge from the interests of the public (minority) shareholders, the corporate structure and governance mechanisms are heavily weighted to incentivize management to act in the interest of the controlling shareholder.

## Long Thesis

iQIYI has successfully transformed from a company focused purely on growth (and often losing money) to an efficient business prioritizing consistent profit. The core bull case rests on the company being the 'HBO of China,' leveraging its ability to create high-quality, exclusive drama series that subscribers are willing to pay more for. Near term, the release of scheduled blockbuster shows will immediately boost subscriber numbers and advertising revenue, reversing recent financial dips. Long term, the company will secure its lead by using AI technology to produce content more cheaply and target ads more effectively. Crucially, they are opening new, high-margin revenue streams by selling merchandise and building themed experiences (like mini-theme parks) based on their popular shows, ensuring growth comes from more than just monthly subscriptions.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The company must maintain its strict focus on cost control to ensure its newfound profitability is sustainable and not temporary. The content strategy must continue to yield popular, 'must-watch' exclusive shows that justify further subscription price increases. The critical long-term assumption is that the company successfully expands its business beyond the screen (merchandise, attractions) to capture significant revenue, and that the Chinese government does not impose overly restrictive content or operating regulations that disrupt production or revenue.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

### Critique and Identification of Flaws in the Bull Thesis

The bull thesis contains significant flaws, primarily by overstating the success and sustainability of the company’s recent strategic shift and underestimating the pressures on its core business.

#### **I. Flaws in the "Consistent Profit" and Cost Control Narrative**

1.  **Fragile and Inconsistent Profitability:** The thesis claims a successful transformation to "consistent profit," but recent financials show this profitability is fragile. The company has reported a sharp year-over-year decline in Non-GAAP operating income and even an operating **loss** (GAAP) in Q2 2025, suggesting that the "newfound profitability" is not yet sustainable.
2.  **Trade-off between Cost Control and Revenue:** The company’s core cost-control measure involves a "lighter content slate," which directly leads to declining revenues. In Q1 and Q2 2025, the year-over-year decrease in total revenue and membership revenue was primarily attributed to this lighter content slate, indicating that maintaining profitability comes at the cost of top-line growth.
3.  **Core Revenue Decline Overwhelms Blockbusters:** The near-term prediction that blockbuster shows will "immediately boost subscriber numbers and advertising revenue" is flawed. Despite delivering blockbusters and maintaining a leading market share in drama viewership, the company’s membership and online advertising revenues decreased year-over-year in Q2 2025, showing that even hit content is not fully offsetting the overall revenue decline.

#### **II. Flaws in the "HBO of China" and Content Strategy Narrative**

1.  **Intense Competition Undercuts Pricing Power:** The "HBO of China" analogy relies on an ability to charge premium prices. However, the Chinese streaming market is dominated by two other major competitors (Tencent Video and Alibaba's Youku), which are also aggressively investing in exclusive, high-quality original content, creating a content arms race that limits iQIYI's unilateral pricing power.
2.  **Saturation and Macroeconomic Pressure on Subscriptions:** Membership numbers have shown signs of declining or stagnation in the past, and while the Average Revenue Per Member (ARM) has increased due to price hikes, continued increases may face greater user resistance, especially amid a generally soft macroeconomic environment in China that also pressures advertising spending.

#### **III. Flaws in the Long-Term Diversification and Technology Narrative**

1.  **IP Diversification is Currently Marginal:** While the "new, high-margin revenue streams" (merchandise, themed experiences, etc.) are a growth area and generated a notable gross merchandise value (GMV) in H1 2025, the entire "Other Revenues" segment accounted for only about **12.5%** of total revenue in Q2 2025. This shows the core business decline is far outpacing the growth of the diversification efforts, making it a distant growth driver, not a "crucial" immediate factor.
2.  **AI Impact is Not Translating to Top-Line Growth:** The expectation that AI will secure the lead by making content cheaper and ads more effective is not fully supported by current results. Although AI-empowered performance advertising is seeing growth, overall online advertising revenue declined in Q1 and Q2 2025. This suggests broader market weaknesses and/or a decline in non-AI-driven brand advertising are overwhelming the technology's efficiency gains.
3.  **Regulatory Risk Remains a Structural Headwind:** The assumption that the government will not impose "overly restrictive content or operating regulations" ignores the reality of the Chinese media environment. Content platforms operate under strict regulatory scrutiny, and a sudden, major policy change could drastically alter content strategy, production speed, and advertising models, representing a constant, unpredictable risk.

---

### Bear Case Thesis for iQIYI, Inc. (IQ)

The core bear case for iQIYI is that its strategy of sacrificing volume for fragile profitability, while facing a saturated, hyper-competitive domestic market, will result in **stagnant or declining core revenue** and **unreliable earnings**, as new ventures are too small to compensate.

1.  **Unsustainable Profit Model & Revenue Stagnation:** The company's recent profitability is precarious and has come at the expense of top-line revenue growth, primarily by reducing the content slate. This creates a difficult cycle where fewer new shows lead to lower subscriber and ad revenue, which prevents the consistent, high-quality content investment required to justify premium prices and retain subscribers long-term.
2.  **Competitive Erosion of Content Edge:** The "HBO of China" concept is undermined by fierce competition from well-funded rivals like Tencent Video and Youku, which also heavily invest in premium originals. This competitive pressure forces continuous high-cost content production to merely maintain market share, making the "must-watch" exclusive content difficult and expensive to deliver consistently, thus challenging the long-term ability to successfully increase subscription prices.
3.  **IP Diversification is Not a Near-Term Lifeline:** New, high-margin revenue streams like merchandise and theme parks, while growing, remain a minor portion of total revenue. The core subscription and advertising businesses are declining faster than the "Other Revenues" segment can grow, meaning significant long-term growth is dependent on an unproven, capital-light IP monetization model successfully challenging established offline entertainment giants.
4.  **Ad Revenue Headwinds and Limited AI Leverage:** The online advertising revenue, a key part of the business, is vulnerable to the macroeconomic slowdown in China and increased competition from short-form video platforms. Although iQIYI is utilizing AI for efficiency, the overall decline in ad revenue demonstrates that technological gains are not enough to overcome broader market weakness, resulting in continued pressure on the ad segment.
