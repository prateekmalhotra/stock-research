## Business Summary

Ecopetrol S.A. is the national integrated oil and gas company of Colombia, meaning it manages every step of the process: finding the oil (exploration), extracting it from the ground (production), moving it through pipelines (transportation), and turning it into consumer products like gasoline (refining). The majority of its revenue comes from selling raw crude oil and refined petroleum products to international customers, primarily other refiners and traders (B2B) located in the Americas and Asia. While the company is focusing on diversifying into natural gas and renewables, the core business remains centered on hydrocarbon sales, with significant sales of refined fuels also occurring domestically within Colombia.

## Business Model Risk

A critical near-term risk is the volatile global price of crude oil; Ecopetrol’s earnings are immediately harmed if oil prices drop sharply, a situation that caused severe financial strain during the 2014 and 2020 price crashes. Additionally, the company faces significant political and regulatory risks, as the Colombian government, its majority owner, has recently signaled intentions to halt new oil exploration contracts, directly threatening the company's long-term production growth prospects. A major long-term risk is the global energy transition, where the shift towards cleaner fuels threatens to reduce future demand for oil and potentially leave existing oil reserves economically worthless, forcing Ecopetrol to urgently invest in diversification or face declining market relevance.

## Company History

This is a history lesson on Ecopetrol S.A. (EC), Colombia's largest company and one of the largest integrated energy companies in Latin America.

### The Inception: Why Ecopetrol was Founded

1.  **Reclaiming National Resources:** Ecopetrol was founded in 1951, initially named *Empresa Colombiana de Petróleos*, to gain national control over Colombia's valuable oil assets.
2.  **End of a Foreign Concession:** Its creation was tied to the reversion of the "De Mares Concession," a major oil field and refinery operation previously run by the foreign-owned Tropical Oil Company, back to the Colombian state.
3.  **Mission of a State-Owned Company:** The company was established as a state-owned enterprise responsible for administering the nation's entire hydrocarbon (oil and gas) resources and managing the reverted assets, including the key Barrancabermeja refinery.

### Key Milestones and Growth (1950s - 2000s)

4.  **Expanding National Control:** Following its inception, Ecopetrol grew as other foreign-held oil concessions expired and their assets, such as the Barrancabermeja and Cartagena Refineries, were transferred to state ownership and direct management.
5.  **Tailwind: The Discovery Boom:** A massive tailwind came in 1983 with the discovery of the giant **Caño Limón field**, a reservoir estimated at 1.1 billion barrels of oil, which was a huge boost for the company and the country.
6.  **Becoming an Exporter:** Thanks to this discovery, Colombia became a net oil exporter again starting in 1986, significantly improving the country's economic standing.
7.  **More Giant Fields:** The 1990s brought further fortune with the discoveries of the **Cusiana and Cupiagua fields**, found in partnership with British Petroleum, which cemented Colombia's oil self-sufficiency.

### Transformation into a Modern, Competitive Company

8.  **The Pivot to Autonomy (2003):** The Colombian government restructured the company in 2003 to make it more competitive and prepare it for international business, transforming it into Ecopetrol S.A., a public stock-holding corporation.
9.  **Separating State Functions:** This restructuring was a key innovative solution that released Ecopetrol from the purely administrative role of managing oil resources for the state, which was transferred to a new agency.
10. **Listing on Global Markets (2007):** Ecopetrol was listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), allowing private investors to buy a stake and raising significant capital for further investment and growth.
11. **Present Day Status:** Today, Ecopetrol is still the largest company in Colombia and one of the world's 35 largest oil companies, operating across the entire energy value chain from finding oil to selling refined products.

### Headwinds, Challenges, and Innovative Solutions

12. **Headwind: Price Volatility and Social Conflict:** Ecopetrol has consistently faced the global headwind of volatile oil prices and, domestically, the challenge of social unrest and protests that have led to road blockades and damage to infrastructure, impacting production.
13. **Solution: Digital and Efficiency Focus:** The company countered these operational challenges by focusing on efficiency, using digital and AI-based systems to optimize its crude oil supply chain and improve reservoir performance.
14. **Headwind: The Energy Transition Challenge:** A major current challenge is the pressure to move away from fossil fuels, driven by global climate goals and Colombia's new government, while still relying on oil for over 95% of its revenue.
15. **Innovative Solution: Dual Strategy and Decarbonization:** Ecopetrol adopted a "dual strategy": using the strong profits from its traditional oil and gas business to aggressively fund a shift into renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and green hydrogen.
16. **Environmental Commitment:** The company has set a goal to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2030 and committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
17. **Cutting-Edge Technology:** As part of its transition, Ecopetrol uses technological solutions like microturbines to capture and use associated natural gas that would otherwise be wastefully burned (flared) at its well sites, reducing its environmental footprint.

### Ecopetrol’s Goal for the Future

18. **Goal: A Diverse Energy Player by 2040:** Ecopetrol’s goal, as outlined in its 2040 Strategy, is to be a diverse energy group that maintains its competitiveness in oil and gas while accelerating the development of low-carbon energy solutions and deepening its digital integration.
19. **Leveraging its Foundation:** It is using its existing strength in the traditional energy business as a springboard to finance the future, proving that a major oil company can balance current economic needs with the need to invest in a cleaner energy future.

## Moat Analysis

Ecopetrol S.A.'s (EC) moat is primarily structural, rooted in its status as Colombia's national oil company (NOC) and its massive, irreplaceable infrastructure. This combination creates an overwhelming competitive advantage, making it extremely difficult for competitors, even those with significant capital, to displace it.

### **The Moat: Key Structural Advantages and Differentiation**

1.  **Government Ownership and Essential Infrastructure (A Natural Monopoly Moat)**
    *   Ecopetrol is the **National Oil Company** of Colombia, with the Colombian government as the majority shareholder (approximately 88.5% as of the end of 2023).
    *   This close relationship means the company's long-term existence and strategic direction are strongly tied to the country's national energy security and fiscal policy, making it practically *undisplaceable* by a private competitor.
    *   The company controls the **vast majority of the country's oil and gas production (around 65% of oil and 80% of gas)**, along with most of the hydrocarbon refining and transportation systems. This physical control over the flow of energy is the ultimate barrier to entry.

2.  **Irreplaceable Transportation and Refining Assets (High Barrier to Entry)**
    *   Ecopetrol owns and operates an **extensive network of pipelines** for crude oil, natural gas, and refined products across Colombia, managed by its subsidiary Cenit. This massive infrastructure represents a huge, high-cost barrier that a new company could not easily replicate.
    *   It owns and runs the major refineries in the country, including the **Barrancabermeja Refinery and Reficar (Cartagena)**, which are crucial for supplying the domestic fuel demand. Any competitor would have to rely on Ecopetrol's system to move and process their product, providing Ecopetrol with a huge advantage.

3.  **The Reason for Growth (Historical Advantage)**
    *   Ecopetrol’s growth into what it is today stems from its origin as the state's takeover of the Tropical Oil Company's Mares Concession, which led to its founding in 1951. It grew by continually acquiring concessions that reverted to the state and taking on the role of administrator of the nation's hydrocarbon resources. Its position as the dominant national champion was secured by government policy and historical asset consolidation.

4.  **Pricing Power and Regulatory Position (Special Market Position)**
    *   The company's position gives it a unique relationship with the domestic market, particularly concerning the **Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC)**. The FEPC mechanism, which is designed to protect consumers from international price fluctuations, effectively channels a significant portion of domestic fuel transactions through Ecopetrol.
    *   While its overall profitability is exposed to global oil prices like any major energy company, its role in the domestic fuel market, supported by the state, provides it with a non-market, regulatory advantage and financial support, which few competitors can match.

### **Contracts and Displacement Analysis**

*   **Customer/Contract Stickiness and Recurring Revenue:** The revenue is highly **recurring and sticky** due to its role as the backbone of the national energy system.
    *   Revenue from pipeline and logistics is essential because any producer or consumer in the country must use its system.
    *   Domestic fuel demand is recurrent, and Ecopetrol's refineries are the primary suppliers. The company has a commercial strategy to strengthen product value and take advantage of the quality and reliability of its supply and logistics integration based on customers, suggesting reliable, long-term commercial relationships.
*   **Ease of Displacement by More Capital:** It is **extremely difficult to displace** Ecopetrol.
    *   An international competitor with more capital would face a dual challenge: building a network of production, refining, and transportation that rivals the state-owned system, and gaining the necessary regulatory and political approval to compete with a National Oil Company on its home ground. The sheer cost and time involved in replicating the physical assets alone are prohibitive.

### **Innovation and Future Strategy**

*   **R&D and Constant Innovation for Edge:** Ecopetrol does invest in R&D, but its moat is not built on constantly innovating a consumer product like a tech company; it is built on its *physical assets and government partnership*.
    *   It has an **Innovation and Technology Center (ICP)**, which focuses on developing solutions for its core business, such as enhanced oil recovery and heavy crude oil technology, to improve operational efficiency.
    *   Crucially, it is heavily investing in **energy transition** to protect its long-term future, which involves:
        *   **Hydrogen** (with plans for a green hydrogen plant).
        *   **Renewable Energy** (investing in solar and wind projects).
        *   **Diversification into other utilities** through the acquisition of ISA, a major electricity transmission, road, and telecommunications company in Latin America. This strategically diversifies its cash flow away from pure hydrocarbons.

## Management Record

Ecopetrol S.A. (EC) Management Analysis for Investors

### Current Management: Ricardo Roa Barragán (CEO since April 2023)

1.  **CEO Background and Political Association:** Ricardo Roa Barragán was appointed CEO in April 2023, bringing over 30 years of experience in the energy sector, having previously served as CEO of Grupo Energía de Bogotá (GEB) and President of TGI. However, a critical investor consideration is his political connection as he managed President Gustavo Petro's 2022 presidential campaign, which raised initial concerns about potential political influence on corporate strategy.

2.  **Management Team Experience:** The current senior management team is generally considered less experienced, with a low average tenure, suggesting a new team put in place to align with the government's priorities. This lack of long-term Ecopetrol tenure may be viewed by some investors as a potential governance risk or a disruption to the institutional continuity.

3.  **Performance and Investor Sentiment (Initial Track Record):** While the company achieved strong operational results in 2024, including the highest oil production in eight years and a record refining load, overall profits have seen a consecutive quarterly decline since Roa's appointment. This mixed financial result, combined with judicial scrutiny related to his past political role, contributes to a mixed investor sentiment regarding the stability and direction of the company.

4.  **Key Decisions & Future Strategy/Vision:** The core **Strategy 2040: "Energy that Transforms"** remains, focusing on maintaining hydrocarbon business value while accelerating the energy transition towards a net-zero carbon goal by 2050. Under Roa, key strategic adjustments include maximizing gas exploration in the Caribbean Offshore for energy security and officially halting new unconventional hydrocarbon exploration in Colombia.

5.  **Delivering on Energy Transition:** Roa's management is committed to a "just and equitable energy transition" and is prioritizing investments in low-emission businesses, including hydrogen, renewable energy, and carbon capture. The goal is for the non-hydrocarbon business, primarily Interconexión Eléctrica (ISA), to contribute 20-25% of the Group's EBITDA by 2040.

### Previous Management: Felipe Bayón Pardo (CEO until March 2023)

6.  **Reasons for Management Change:** Felipe Bayón's departure was announced in early 2023 as a "mutual agreement" after six years in the role, but it followed a clash with the new administration's more urgent timeline for the energy transition and its push to halt new exploration. His exit was viewed by investors as a sign of increased government interference and added tension to the country's oil and gas sector.

7.  **Track Record of Value Delivery (Key Decisions):** Bayón's management successfully led the acquisition of a 51.4% controlling stake in **Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. (ISA)** in 2021, a major diversification move that immediately made Ecopetrol an integrated energy group. He is credited with leading Ecopetrol's technological transformation and setting the ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

8.  **Financial Performance and Shareholder Value (Previous):** The previous management delivered the **best financial results in Ecopetrol's history in 2022**, achieving a record net income of COP 33.4 trillion and a high EBITDA margin, which resulted in massive transfers to the Nation and large dividends for minority shareholders. This performance was driven by favorable commodity prices, the contribution from the Permian basin, and the ISA acquisition.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Ecopetrol S.A.'s (EC) compensation policies and ownership structure, which is detailed in its public filings (Form 20-F equivalent for a foreign private issuer), the following is the assessment of management incentive and alignment with shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentives and Compensation Structure**

1.  **Compensation Components:** The total compensation for Ecopetrol's senior management and CEO is structured in three main parts: **Fixed Compensation** (salary and benefits), **Short-Term Incentives (STI)**, and **Long-Term Incentives (LTI)**.

2.  **Performance Alignment (STI):** Short-Term Incentives are paid based on a Balanced Scorecard (TBG) that includes a mix of measurable financial and non-financial targets. These objectives are explicitly designed to align employees with the company's annual business goals.

3.  **Long-Term/Shareholder Alignment (LTI):** The Long-Term Incentive plans (LTI) are specifically stated as a tool to **"line up the leaders with the interest of our shareholders"** and encourage the achievement of strategic objectives for corporate sustainability. These plans promote the "reciprocal generation of value" for the Ecopetrol Group, its shareholders, and management.

4.  **Strategic & ESG Metrics:** Performance targets for the CEO's compensation heavily prioritize the company's strategic vision, including the energy transition. For instance, recent Balanced Scorecards have allocated significant weight to non-traditional metrics like **"Grow with Energy Transition"** and a component for **"TESG"** (Technology, Environmental, Social, and Governance), which aligns management's focus with long-term, sustainable value creation, rather than purely short-term profit.

### **Insider Ownership by Managers and Directors**

1.  **State Control (Major Shareholder):** Ecopetrol is a majority state-controlled enterprise, with the Republic of Colombia (Entidades Estatales) holding approximately **88.49%** of the outstanding shares.

2.  **Individual Insider Ownership:** Due to the company's government-controlled nature, the individual ownership of shares by any single director or executive officer is inherently very low relative to the total capital. This means the incentive to act in the interest of shareholders is driven more by the variable compensation structure's link to corporate performance and LTI awards (which act as a proxy for equity) than by a "high" personal ownership percentage.

### **Conclusion on Incentives**

The management and compensation structure for Ecopetrol appears to be sufficiently incentivized to act in the long-term interest of its shareholders, particularly in the context of a state-controlled entity:

1.  **Aligned with Value and Sustainability:** The compensation structure uses a robust mix of short- and long-term incentives that are directly linked to measurable targets for both **financial performance** (Competitive Returns) and **long-term strategic goals**, especially the energy transition and value generation.

2.  **Discourages Short-Term Pockets-Lining:** The significant weighting of targets toward **ESG** and **long-term sustainability** metrics (e.g., energy transition, carbon footprint reduction) through LTI plans actively discourages management from taking risks to achieve purely short-term profits at the expense of the company’s future value.

3.  **Corporate Governance Over Personal Wealth:** While individual insider ownership is not "high," the variable compensation is structured to align performance with the *collective* shareholder value, suggesting the motivation is based on the reward for executing the long-term corporate strategy, which benefits all shareholders, including the majority shareholder (the Colombian government).

## Long Thesis

Ecopetrol offers a strong bull case because it is a protected, high-cash-flow machine that is aggressively buying its way into a diversified, future-proof energy business. Near-term, the company’s structural monopoly (it owns all the pipelines and refineries in Colombia) ensures stable revenue regardless of political shifts. Current oil production is at its highest level in a decade and is generating enormous profits (high margins), which allows the company to pay large, attractive dividends to shareholders. Long-term, Ecopetrol is using these oil profits to fund a radical transformation. By acquiring ISA (a major electricity and utilities company) and investing heavily in cleaner fuels like natural gas, solar, and wind, the company is changing from a volatile oil producer into a stable, integrated energy utility for Latin America. Since the stock is currently cheap due to political uncertainty, any success in this transition or calming of political fears should lead to a massive stock price rebound.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that oil prices remain stable enough (well above the company's production cost) to continuously fund the costly shift into renewables and diversification projects like ISA. Secondly, the Colombian government must allow management to continue the energy transition strategy and reinvest a substantial portion of profits into future businesses (gas, electricity, solar) rather than demanding excessively high dividends or taxes that starve the transition funds. Lastly, the company's large investments in non-hydrocarbon assets (like ISA and offshore gas exploration) must become profitable and successfully contribute 20-25% of the company's total earnings by 2040.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The long thesis for Ecopetrol S.A. contains significant flaws, primarily by underestimating the immediate and long-term impact of heightened political risk and overstating the company's financial autonomy to execute a costly energy transition.

Here is a bear case, identifying the holes and faults in the long thesis:

1.  **Direct Political Interference Undermines Corporate Autonomy and Transition Funding:** The thesis incorrectly assumes a "protected, high-cash-flow machine" with stable revenue "regardless of political shifts." In reality, the Colombian government, Ecopetrol's majority owner, has been accused of viewing the company as a "cashbox," demanding high dividends, increasing taxes, and using political influence to make strategic decisions. This interference directly jeopardizes the primary assumption that profits will be allowed to continuously fund the costly shift into renewables.

2.  **Hydrocarbon Core Business Is Under Threat, Starving the Transition:** The "enormous profits" needed for a "radical transformation" are shrinking due to political policy and are unsustainable long-term. The government's policy of halting new oil and gas exploration contracts and pressuring the company to abandon profitable joint ventures (like the one in the US Permian Basin) threatens Ecopetrol's reserve replacement, future revenue, and overall stability. Furthermore, Ecopetrol's net profits have already seen significant year-over-year declines due to a higher tax burden and a ruling that disallowed oil royalties as a deductible expense.

3.  **Governance Risk and Instability Deter Investors:** The political uncertainty is not just a cheap stock catalyst, but a structural risk to governance. The government has attempted to appoint directors who lack the required experience and have an anti-oil stance, creating an agency conflict and reducing the board's independence. This unstable operating environment, compounded by civil and geopolitical disruptions like frequent blockades, has led major financial institutions to downgrade the stock, citing the "cloudy geopolitical environment."

4.  **Diversification Strategy is Slow and Capital-Intensive:** The ambitious long-term goal for non-hydrocarbon assets (like ISA) to contribute 20-25% of earnings by 2040 is highly questionable, as two-thirds of the company's planned capital expenditures between 2022 and 2024 were still dedicated to the upstream (oil and gas) segment. While the ISA acquisition provides stable cash flow, it also contributed to an elevated debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a downgrade of the company's Stand-Alone Credit Profile, indicating constrained financial flexibility for future major investments.

5.  **Contradictory Energy Policy Creates Regulatory Headwinds:** The thesis relies on a smooth transition to a "stable, integrated energy utility," but the government's energy policy is internally inconsistent, with the President alternately supporting and criticizing natural gas. This lack of a coherent and stable joint strategy between the state and the company makes large-scale, long-term infrastructure investment highly risky and unpredictable. A potential move to import natural gas from Venezuela, as considered by the government, also risks undermining Colombia's energy independence and Ecopetrol's role as the primary domestic producer.

---

## Next Steps

The analysis is thorough and has successfully converted vague risks (like tax burden and reserve depletion) into quantifiable metrics (ETR, RRR, ISA contribution). The remaining investigation should focus on the live, high-impact political and strategic execution risks that most affect investor confidence.

Here are the next steps and important questions to investigate further, leveraging new information from the initial search.

### I. Quantify and Track High-Profile Political and Governance Risks

1.  **CEO Judicial Status:** What is the current status of the judicial scrutiny and potential investigations involving CEO Ricardo Roa Barragán?
    *   *Rationale:* This is a critical governance and stability risk mentioned in the management analysis. A formal charge or resolution would be an immediate, high-impact catalyst (negative or positive).

2.  **Permian Basin Strategy Confirmation:** Has the Colombian government or Ecopetrol officially mandated or signaled an *exit* from the profitable U.S. Permian Basin joint venture?
    *   *Rationale:* The bear case specifically cites abandoning this asset as a risk. While the data shows the Permian is contributing to reserves and production, the political pressure to exit for ideological reasons is the key unanswered question.

3.  **Future Natural Gas Imports (Venezuela):** What is the latest update on the Colombian government's plan to import natural gas from Venezuela, and what is Ecopetrol's projected role or financial exposure in this plan?
    *   *Rationale:* Importing gas would directly undercut Ecopetrol's high-priority domestic gas strategy and the commercial viability of its offshore Caribbean discoveries.

### II. Verify the Financial Commitment to the Energy Transition

4.  **Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Allocation Breakdown:** What is the official, current percentage breakdown of Ecopetrol’s 2025-2026 Capital Expenditure (CapEx) plan by major business segment?
    *   *Rationale:* The bear case criticizes the two-thirds focus on oil and gas. We need an updated, granular split of CapEx between: Upstream (Oil/Gas), Midstream (Pipelines), Downstream (Refining), and **ISA/Renewables/Low-Carbon**.

5.  **ISA's Contribution vs. Debt:** While ISA's EBITDA contribution is steady at $\sim 16\%$, what is the current quantitative measure of Ecopetrol’s consolidated **Debt-to-EBITDA ratio** following the ISA acquisition?
    *   *Rationale:* The acquisition led to a credit profile downgrade. This metric will quantify the financial leverage risk and the company's flexibility for future diversification efforts.

### III. Refine the Reserve-Related Risk

6.  **Long-Term Gas Security Strategy:** Given the short gas reserve life (6.7 years) and the halt on new exploration contracts, what are the specific, short-term contracts or projects Ecopetrol is relying on to bridge the gap until major offshore gas projects (like Uchuva/Gorgon, expected 2027-2029) come online?
    *   *Rationale:* Gas is the key "transition fuel" in Colombia, and a gap in gas supply represents a major national energy security risk that Ecopetrol must address.
