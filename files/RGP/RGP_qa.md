## Business Summary

Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP) is a global professional services firm that helps large and medium-sized businesses solve complex operational challenges. The core business model involves providing highly specialized, senior-level consultants—often former corporate executives—on a flexible, project-by-project basis in areas like finance, technology, and risk management. This allows client companies, which are geographically diverse and span many industries, to acquire high-level talent quickly without committing to permanent employment, generating revenue from the billed hours of these deployed consultants.

---

## Business Model Risk

The most immediate risk is the cyclical nature of consulting; during an economic downturn, client companies rapidly cut discretionary spending, causing demand for RGP's project-based consultants to fall significantly, which has historically caused sharp drops in their earnings. A major long-term risk involves the intense competition for highly skilled professionals; if RGP cannot recruit and retain top consultants, or if their specialized services become less relevant due to new technology or automation, their ability to earn revenue and maintain market share will be jeopardized. Both economic downturns and the fight for talent have been persistent threats that continue to cause concern for the business's future stability.

## Company History

The history of Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP) is essentially the story of a company that challenged the traditional, expensive way of hiring top-tier business experts and has continually adapted its model to survive major industry and economic changes.

Here is a detailed, jargon-free history from inception to the present day.

---

### **Part 1: Inception and The Founding Principle (1996 - 1999)**

1.  **A Better Way to Consult (1996):** Resources Connection was founded in June 1996 as a small division within the major accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. The idea was created by a team led by senior partner Donald B. Murray.
2.  **The Founding Goal:** The core goal was to offer a more flexible and affordable alternative to traditional consulting firms. Instead of expensive, long-term engagements, RGP provided highly experienced, senior-level financial professionals for specific, project-based work, like fixing accounting systems or helping with corporate mergers.
3.  **The Core Innovative Model:** The company’s first great innovation was to hire these seasoned professionals as consultants who could be deployed "on-demand." This gave companies a way to access high-level expertise exactly when they needed it, without the long-term commitment of hiring a full-time employee or the massive cost of a traditional consulting project.

### **Part 2: The Regulatory Headwind and Independence (1999 - 2005)**

4.  **Major Problem: Regulatory Conflict (1999):** A significant industry change was looming, with regulators starting to separate the auditing and consulting sides of major accounting firms. The rules were designed to avoid conflicts of interest, meaning the company that audits your books should not also be advising you on how to set up those same books.
5.  **Innovative Solution: The Spin-Off:** To avoid these growing regulatory conflicts and allow the business to grow without Deloitte’s constraints, the unit was spun off in 1999 through a management-led buyout. This independence was an early, critical step.
6.  **A Major Tailwind (Post-2002):** The spin-off perfectly positioned the newly independent company for a major market tailwind. After corporate scandals in the early 2000s, the US government passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which forced public companies to greatly improve their financial controls and reporting.
7.  **Capitalizing on Compliance:** This new, massive need for corporate governance and compliance expertise was a perfect match for RGP's model of providing experienced financial and accounting professionals for immediate, project-based help.
8.  **Becoming a Public Company:** The company went public in December 2000 on the NASDAQ, successfully raising capital to fuel its growth and global expansion, including opening its first international offices. The operating name was formally changed to **Resources Global Professionals** in 2005 to reflect this international reach.

### **Part 3: Evolution and Addressing New Headwinds (2010 - Present)**

9.  **The New Competitive Headwind:** As the company grew into the 2010s, it began to face new challenges from the changing workforce. Traditional consulting was facing disruption from digital transformation, the rise of powerful online "gig platforms" (like Upwork or Fiverr for professionals), and eventually, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
10. **Innovative Solution: Diversification and Segmentation (Mid-2010s):** RGP evolved its model beyond just accounting and finance by creating a more integrated service model and acquiring specialized firms.
    *   **Veracity Consulting (2019):** An acquisition that added deep expertise in digital transformation, data, and technology, allowing RGP to handle complex "next-gen" consulting projects.
    *   **Countsy:** The creation of an Outsourced Services segment, which acts like a specialized, third-party group to build full financial and HR infrastructure for startups and high-growth companies.
11. **Focus on the Integrated Approach:** By the 2020s, RGP solidified its offerings into three main, integrated segments: **On-Demand Talent** (the original model), **Consulting** (for higher-value strategy and execution), and **Outsourced Services**. This allows clients to hire a flexible mix of resources.
12. **The Latest Headwinds (Recent Years):** RGP has struggled in recent years with a general economic slowdown, which caused many clients to pause or delay large projects. This slowdown has hurt its revenue and profitability, putting pressure on the business.
13. **Current Adaptations:** In response, the company has focused on aggressive cost-cutting measures, continued to shift its revenue mix toward higher-value consulting, and invested in AI tools like its "rIQ" accelerator to become a more tech-enabled firm. In late 2024, the company changed its headquarters from California to Dallas, Texas, seeking a more central location to better support its global operations.
14. **Goal Today:** RGP's current goal is to be the premier provider of "agile consulting services," uniting strategy, execution, and specialized talent across areas like finance, digital transformation, and compliance to help companies navigate a world of constant change.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP) is primarily built on its unique hybrid model that sits between traditional, expensive consulting firms and on-demand staffing agencies, combined with a highly experienced talent pool.

### Analysis of RGP's Moat and Differentiation

1.  **Hybrid Business Model:** RGP's main difference is its position as a diversified platform, offering a combination of **on-demand specialized talent**, traditional **consulting**, and **outsourced services**. This structure gives clients maximum flexibility on how they engage, which few firms effectively combine.
2.  **Highly Experienced Talent Network:** Their "global talent network" consists of **mid- to senior-level professionals** with 10 to 20 or more years of experience, often having worked directly *in* the industry, not just as career consultants. This deep, practical experience makes them immediately credible and effective within a client's team.
3.  **Collaborative, Cost-Effective Approach:** Unlike traditional, "big four" consulting firms that may dictate solutions, RGP's model is designed to be **collaborative, outcome-oriented, and more cost-effective**. This appeals to clients who need high-impact results without the high price tag of large consultancies.
4.  **Focus on Critical Transformation Areas:** The company is intentionally focused on two critical, high-value solution areas: **CFO Advisory** and **Digital Transformation**. This focus on mission-critical projects helps them secure larger, "stickier" business.

### Pricing Power and Special Position

1.  **Specialized Value-Based Pricing:** RGP has demonstrated some **pricing power** through a "value-based pricing initiative," resulting in an increase in average bill rates, especially in its Consulting segment and international markets.
2.  **Trusted Partner Status:** Their special position is being a **trusted partner** that can deliver both the high-level strategy *and* the specialized talent required for implementation, providing greater control and efficiency to the client.
3.  **Geographic Expansion:** Growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific, with stronger bill rates and deeper client relationships, underscores the strength of their strategy in markets where their unique model is gaining traction.

### Customer Stickiness and Recurring Revenue

1.  **High Client Retention:** The company reports a very strong **87% retention rate for its Fortune 100 clients**, which suggests long-term, sticky relationships with the largest customers.
2.  **Shift to Stickier Contracts:** While their core "On-Demand Talent" model is often project-based, the company is actively transforming to secure larger **consulting projects** to create "stickier business" and higher-level, more recurring relationships.

### Displacement and Competitive Advantages

1.  **Displacement by Capital is Difficult:** While RGP faces competition from both large consultancies and low-cost **gig economy platforms** like Upwork, their moat is not easily breached by just having more capital.
2.  **Talent Barrier to Entry:** The primary barrier is not capital but the **global network of seasoned practitioners** with 10-20+ years of industry experience. A competitor cannot easily replicate this deep, specialized, and flexible talent pool overnight.
3.  **Ongoing Efforts to Create Moat:** The company is currently executing a **holistic technology transformation** to drive operational efficiency and is expanding its **outsourced services** to diversify and build a more stable, profitable business.
4.  **Minimal Network Effects:** RGP relies more on the **quality and expertise** of its talent network than on classic network effects (where the platform gets more valuable as more users join). The value is in the human capital, not the size of the marketplace alone.

### R&D and Innovation

1.  **Investment in Technology for Edge:** Instead of traditional R&D, RGP invests heavily in **technology upgrades, digital platforms, and AI** to gain an edge.
2.  **Innovation is Key:** The company is **constantly innovating** its service delivery model. A recent example is the launch of **rIQ**, a proprietary AI accelerator built on the ServiceNow platform, which is part of its digital transformation strategy to incorporate AI and automation into its services.
3.  **Evolution from Staffing:** The reason RGP grew into what it is today is by evolving from a professional staffing organization to a **diversified platform** that provides both the strategic consulting and the specialized talent for execution, filling a crucial market gap.

## Catalyst Analysis

Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP) catalysts are driven by its internal strategic shift towards high-value services and operating efficiency, combined with external market dynamics.

### **Near-Term Catalysts (6-12 Months)**

1.  **Sustained Profitability from Cost Management:** Despite a soft or "choppy" demand environment, RGP's focus on cost discipline and operational efficiency has led to consistently better-than-expected gross margins and adjusted EBITDA in recent quarters (Q1 FY26, Q4 FY25).
2.  **Pipeline Conversion in Key Segments:** Management is seeing growth in the sales pipeline for higher-value services, particularly in CFO Advisory and digital transformation.
3.  **New CEO and Leadership Change:** The recent CEO transition (announced in November 2025) and new hires like the President of CFO Advisory may signal fresh strategy or a renewed focus that investors could view positively.
4.  **Capital Return to Shareholders:** The company continues its strategy of returning cash to shareholders through regular cash dividends and opportunistic share buybacks, which can support the stock price.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12+ Months)**

1.  **Recovery in Client Spending on Transformation:** Management is aggressively positioning the business for the eventual economic upturn. As the uncertain macro environment stabilizes and clients release "delayed transformation projects," this should lead to a significant increase in revenue for RGP's Consulting and On-Demand segments.
2.  **Focus on Higher-Value Digital Services (Strategy):** RGP is executing a strategy to shift its mix toward higher-margin, tech-enabled services like digital transformation, ERP cloud migration, and specialized talent that embraces AI, which supports long-term revenue growth and margin expansion.
3.  **AI-Enabled Consulting and Service Offerings:** The launch of **rIQ**, a proprietary AI accelerator built on ServiceNow, is a tangible step toward its strategy to deliver high-value, specialized talent solutions for complex change, a space management believes is their "sweet spot."
4.  **Growth in Europe and Outsourced Services:** Management highlighted that the Europe and Asia Pacific segments, along with the Outsourced Services segment, have returned to growth (e.g., 5% and 4% growth, respectively, in Q1 FY26), showing geographical and service diversification for future growth.

### **Management's Explicit Commentary on Strategy (From Recent Earnings Calls)**

*   **Strategic Direction:** The company is focused on "evolving the business to become more integrated, diversified, and resilient," built upon its three core engagement models: On-Demand Talent, Consulting, and Outsourced Services.
*   **Operating Efficiency:** Management has stated a clear plan to deliver "enhanced value creation" through "cost discipline and operating efficiency" to maximize financial performance as the company awaits the return of demand.
*   **Market Position (AI/Digital):** Management emphasizes that RGP's expertise lies in providing "specialized talent that embraces AI and automation to streamline, enhance, and cost optimize the delivery of complex change and transformation work," which differentiates them from firms using less-experienced generalists.

## Management Record

Based on an analysis of its recent leadership, here is a summary of Resources Connection, Inc.'s (RGP) management for an investor:

1.  **Recent Leadership Transition:** Resources Connection, Inc. underwent a major CEO transition in November 2025, appointing board member Roger Carlile as the new President and CEO to "advance the Company's strategic transformation." The Board decided not to renew the employment agreement of the outgoing CEO, Kate W. Duchene, who transitioned to an Executive Advisor role.

2.  **Previous CEO's Financial Track Record:** The departure of the previous CEO, Kate W. Duchene, followed a period of unsatisfactory financial performance for the company. Over the three years leading up to May 2025, RGP's Earnings Per Share (EPS) declined by 114-122%, resulting in a total loss to shareholders of 67-70%.

3.  **New CEO's Background and Expertise:** Roger Carlile brings a strong background from the professional services industry, having served as a former CFO of a publicly registered consulting firm and founded and led the high-growth consulting firm Ankura Consulting Group. He had already been working with the company on its growth strategy since joining the Board in June 2024.

4.  **Management Alignment with Shareholders (Key Decision):** To align his interests with shareholders, the new CEO received a significant new-hire equity grant of 600,000 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), valued at approximately 1.8% of the company's market capitalization. Upon the announcement of the leadership change, RGP's stock saw a positive reaction, surging 8.1%.

5.  **Future Strategy and Vision:** The core strategic vision under Carlile is focused on **CFO Advisory and Digital Transformation** consulting solutions, which he was instrumental in developing prior to his appointment. The company is strategically moving from a professional staffing model to a diversified platform combining on-demand talent with consulting and outsourced services.

6.  **Performance Goals:** The management team's strategic transformation aims to increase RGP's addressable market and is explicitly focused on improving returns for shareholders. The stated goal for this transformation is to enable the company to return to **double-digit profitability** as the demand environment improves.

7.  **Management Team Experience:** The broader RGP management team is considered "not experienced" due to a relatively short average tenure of 1.5 years, suggesting a newly restructured executive group under the new CEO.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Resources Connection, Inc.'s (RGP) recent proxy filings, here is an analysis of the management incentive and compensation structure.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis for Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP)**

**1. Insider Ownership and Alignment**

*   **Insider Ownership:** The collective beneficial ownership for all directors and executive officers as a group is approximately **6.58%** of the company's common stock.
*   **Conclusion on Ownership:** While this figure represents a tangible, multi-million dollar stake in the company, it is not considered exceptionally high for an insider group, suggesting their personal wealth is primarily tied to their compensation structure rather than a majority equity position.

**2. Compensation Structure (Pay Mix)**

*   **Compensation at Risk:** A significant majority of the Named Executive Officers' (NEOs') target total direct compensation is "at risk," meaning it is variable and not guaranteed.
    *   For fiscal 2025, approximately **75% of the CEO's** and an average of **70% of other NEOs'** target total direct compensation was tied to company performance and/or stock price.
*   **Mix Focus:** The high percentage of "at-risk" pay demonstrates a formal commitment to a pay-for-performance model, which is a strong structural incentive to align with shareholder interests.

**3. Specific Performance Metrics and Incentive Quality**

*   **Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) Metrics:** The cash-based Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) is based on a mix of financial and operational metrics: **Revenue**, **Adjusted EBITDA Margin**, and individual qualitative criteria.
    *   *Analysis:* Tying a significant portion of the annual bonus to Adjusted EBITDA Margin helps balance top-line revenue growth with profitability, which is a key driver of shareholder value creation.
*   **Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Metrics:** A portion of the Performance Stock Units (PSUs), which typically vest over a three-year period, has historically been linked to operational financial metrics, specifically **Revenue** and **Adjusted EBITDA Percentage**.
    *   *Analysis:* While these are performance metrics, focusing a significant part of the multi-year LTI on non-stock measures like Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Percentage (as opposed to 100% on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) or Earnings Per Share (EPS)) can incentivize management to hit internal operating targets that may not translate directly to stock price appreciation and shareholder returns in the short term.

### **Conclusion on Incentive Alignment**

The overall structure provides a **moderate to high incentive** for management to act in the interest of shareholders, but with a potential structural leaning toward operational goals.

*   **Incentives for Shareholder Interest:** The very large portion of compensation that is "at risk" (70-75%) forces executives to deliver performance to receive their target pay, and the inclusion of **Adjusted EBITDA Margin** promotes profitable growth.
*   **Potential for Self-Enrichment Focus:** A public concern has been raised that high CEO compensation has coincided with a significant decline in shareholder returns (Total Loss to Shareholders of 70% over three years).
*   **Mitigation/Risk:** The primary risk is that the reliance on operational metrics like Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Percentage for the Long-Term Incentive, instead of pure **Total Shareholder Return (TSR)**, could incentivize management to pursue growth and operational efficiency that is detached from the ultimate goal of stock price appreciation and direct shareholder value.

## Long Thesis

Resources Connection (RGP) is an undervalued company that is currently stabilizing itself during an economic slowdown and is set to capture massive future demand. The company is successfully shifting its focus from simple temporary staffing to higher-value, stickier consulting services, particularly in areas like financial management and digital transformation. This unique model—providing highly experienced, senior professionals at a lower cost than traditional firms—gives them a competitive advantage. In the near term, new leadership and aggressive cost-cutting measures are stabilizing profits, confirmed by recent insider stock purchases. Long term, as the global economy recovers, delayed corporate transformation projects will be released. RGP is ideally positioned with its specialized talent network and new proprietary AI tools (like rIQ) to win these profitable, large contracts, leading to significant expansion of their revenue and overall profit margins.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The primary assumption is that the current global economic uncertainty will stabilize, causing client companies to restart spending on large, discretionary transformation and digital projects. Furthermore, the bull case relies on the new CEO successfully executing the strategic shift toward higher-margin consulting and outsourcing services, improving average contract bill rates and overall profitability. Finally, the company must effectively integrate its new technology and AI accelerators (like rIQ) to maintain a cost and efficiency advantage over competitors.

## Bear Case Scenario

This critique identifies several holes and faults in the long thesis for Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP).

## Critique and Flaws in the Long Thesis

1.  **Flawed Premise of "New Leadership":** The thesis credits "new leadership" for the strategic shift, but former CEO Kate Duchene—who drove the transformation strategy—was in the role since late 2016 and **stepped down in October 2025** after the board chose not to renew her contract. This indicates dissatisfaction with the execution of the very strategy the bull case relies upon and creates significant near-term leadership uncertainty, which undercuts the stability narrative.
2.  **Revenue Decline Contradicts "Stabilizing":** While RGP has improved its Adjusted EBITDA margin through aggressive cost-cutting, its top-line performance is shrinking, not stabilizing. Full Fiscal Year 2025 revenue declined significantly, and the revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was down by **12.2%** year-over-year, which suggests the "economic slowdown" is having a severe, prolonged impact on client spending.
3.  **Massive Goodwill Impairment Overshadows Margin Improvement:** The company recorded a substantial, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of **$194.4 million** in Fiscal Year 2025, resulting in a large net loss. This charge strongly suggests that RGP's prior acquisitions and investments, made specifically to drive the strategic shift into higher-value consulting services, have been significantly overvalued or have failed to deliver their expected returns.
4.  **Technological Competitive Advantage (rIQ) is Unproven and Late:** The proprietary AI tool, rIQ, was just launched in late 2025 and is built *on* the ServiceNow platform. Its impact on "winning profitable, large contracts" is yet to be realized, especially when major, deep-pocketed consulting firms (e.g., McKinsey, BCG) are already generating hundreds of millions of dollars in AI consulting revenue and restructuring their entire operations around GenAI.
5.  **"Lower Cost" Advantage Is Not a Moat for Transformation Projects:** While RGP offers a lower-cost model than the Big Four, complex "digital transformation" and "large contracts" often prioritize the specialized intellectual property and vast resources of global management consulting firms. The cost advantage is less compelling for mission-critical, high-stakes projects where a Big Four name provides reputational security and deep, proprietary methodologies.

***

## Bear Case Thesis for Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP)

The long thesis overestimates the company's competitive standing and strategic execution while understating severe risks from a shrinking top line and poor capital allocation.

**The Bear Case:**

1.  **Declining Demand and Structural Shrinkage:** RGP’s dramatic revenue decline of over 12% year-over-year demonstrates that the current economic slowdown is severely impacting client spending on their services, with no clear bottom in sight. This shrinkage is structural, undermining the core assumption that the company is "stabilizing" and questioning RGP’s ability to effectively compete for new projects even when the economy recovers.
2.  **Failure of Past Strategy and Impaired Value:** The massive **$194.4 million** goodwill impairment charge in FY2025 is an explicit acknowledgment that the value of RGP's acquisitions and long-term strategic investments to pivot toward higher-margin consulting has been destroyed or was grossly inflated. This negates the claim of a successful shift and highlights significant problems with capital allocation and management’s ability to integrate or monetize acquired consulting assets.
3.  **Leadership Instability Under Duress:** The recent replacement of the long-term CEO in late 2025, following the major revenue declines and goodwill impairment, signals board-level frustration with the execution of the existing strategy. The new CEO faces a significant challenge in re-accelerating a shrinking company amidst deep competitive pressures, introducing substantial execution risk that has not been proven out.
4.  **Inadequate Competitive Moat in AI/Digital Consulting:** The new AI accelerator, rIQ, is a latecomer to a market already dominated by global consulting and IT giants who possess multi-billion-dollar investments and existing, scaled platforms in digital transformation. RGP's new, niche technology is unlikely to be sufficient to win the "massive, profitable contracts" touted in the bull case against entrenched market leaders.

---

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive analysis already completed and the new information gathered, the next steps should focus on quantifying the risk of the failed strategy and getting more detail on the new CEO's execution plan.

Here are the most important next questions and investigation steps:

### **1. Quantify the Failure of the Strategic Pivot (The Goodwill Impairment)**

The analysis revealed a massive **$194.4 million goodwill impairment** in FY2025, with large portions attributed to the **Consulting segment ($98.6M)** and **On-Demand Talent segment ($70.2M)**. This directly challenges the Long Thesis.

*   **Determine Specific Failed Acquisitions:** Identify the key acquisitions, particularly the high-value ones in the Consulting segment (like Veracity or Reference Point), that led to the bulk of the impairment. This will clarify which part of the "strategic shift" has functionally failed and how much capital was misallocated.
*   **Analyze the Consulting Segment's Profitability Trajectory:** Investigate the specific operating metrics (beyond just the impairment) of the Consulting segment over the last 1-2 years. While bill rates are up, is the segment's adjusted EBITDA margin improving fast enough to justify the remaining goodwill?

### **2. Deep Dive into Valuation and The Margin of Safety**

The stock is technically a "Strong Sell," but a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of **0.3x** is extremely low compared to the industry average of 1.4x, suggesting the stock is potentially undervalued on a sales basis. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) is negative due to the net loss.

*   **Benchmark EV/EBITDA:** Use the calculated EV/EBITDA of **10.13x** (or lower, depending on TTM EBITDA) and compare it directly to a *focused list* of direct competitors (e.g., Kroll, CBIZ, Huron Consulting Group, and select specialized staffing firms) to see if RGP is truly cheap or appropriately priced for a company with negative revenue growth.
*   **Evaluate the Dividend Sustainability:** The company has a high dividend yield (around 6%) but had a net loss of $191.8 million and a thin Adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.3% in FY2025. Analyze the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Operating Cash Flow (OCF) in relation to the total dividend payout to determine the true sustainability of the cash dividend without debt.

### **3. Assess the New CEO's Strategy and Revenue Re-Acceleration Plan**

The new CEO, Roger Carlile, must address the severe top-line decline. The previous CEO was dismissed for failure to execute.

*   **Find Specific Revenue Re-acceleration Targets:** Search for the new CEO's explicit commentary or guidance (from the most recent earnings calls or presentations) on a timeline and target metric for when he expects to stop the revenue decline and return to growth.
*   **Analyze the Consulting vs. On-Demand Revenue Split:** Determine the precise percentage split of RGP's total revenue between the higher-value **Consulting segment** and the shrinking **On-Demand Talent segment** for the most recent quarter (Q1 FY26). This metric is the best measure of whether the strategic pivot is actually shifting the revenue mix.
*   **Investigate the Success of rIQ (AI Tool):** Look for any verifiable case studies, client testimonials, or management commentary that quantifies the actual revenue or pipeline growth generated specifically by the rIQ AI accelerator, rather than just the intent to use it.
