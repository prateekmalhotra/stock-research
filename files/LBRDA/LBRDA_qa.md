## Business Summary

Liberty Broadband Corporation operates primarily as a holding company, meaning its core business is owning a large, non-controlling stake in other companies. Its main asset is its significant ownership interest (approximately 26%) in Charter Communications, which operates the Spectrum brand. Charter is one of the largest providers of broadband internet, cable television, and telephone services across the United States. The customers are primarily residential consumers and small to medium-sized businesses across a vast geographic footprint. Liberty Broadband’s business model relies entirely on the successful operation and sustained profitability of Charter Communications, deriving its value from the appreciation of the underlying stock and any dividends received. Charter’s revenue is dominated by monthly subscription fees for internet access, followed by video and voice services.

## Business Model Risk

Since Liberty Broadband is a holding company, the immediate and long-term risk is entirely dependent on the operational and financial health of Charter Communications. A major near-term risk is intense competition, particularly from emerging technologies like Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), where wireless carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon offer internet services using their 5G networks, providing a cheaper alternative to traditional cable internet. A long-term risk involves the aggressive expansion of competitors utilizing fiber optic technology, which provides faster and more reliable speeds than the older cable infrastructure. This threat has been exacerbated by government subsidies (like the BEAD program) encouraging rivals to build high-speed fiber networks in territories where Charter currently dominates, pressuring subscriber growth and pricing power. Historically, Charter has faced competition from satellite TV and older phone lines (DSL), but the current threats (Fiber and FWA) are technically superior and pose a more serious concern to the company's market share and earnings potential.

## Company History

This history lesson will explain the creation, journey, and goal of Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA), a company that primarily functions as a major, strategic investor in the vast world of high-speed internet and cable television.

### I. The Inception and Founding (2014)

1.  **A Focused Spin-Off:** Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA) was officially established in 2014 when it was "spun off" from its parent company, Liberty Media Corporation. A spin-off is essentially creating a new, independent public company by distributing shares of a division to the existing shareholders of the parent company.

2.  **The Founding Goal:** The main reason for its creation was to isolate and focus on a specific set of assets: those related to the broadband and communications industry. By separating these assets, Liberty Media aimed to give investors a clearer, more focused way to invest directly in the potential growth of broadband, primarily through its large ownership stake in another company, Charter Communications.

3.  **The Principal Asset:** From day one, Liberty Broadband's most important asset was its significant minority stake in **Charter Communications**, one of the largest cable and internet providers in the United States. This means Liberty Broadband's success would be directly tied to Charter's performance and growth.

### II. The Journey: Key Strategic Moves and Growth

4.  **Doubling Down on Cable:** Soon after its formation, Liberty Broadband demonstrated its commitment to the cable industry by using capital, including funds from issuing convertible notes, to increase its ownership of Charter Communications stock.

5.  **The Game-Changing Acquisition (Innovative Solution):** The company’s value skyrocketed due to a massive move by Charter Communications. In 2016, Charter, with Liberty Broadband's backing, completed the acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. This bold, strategic consolidation instantly transformed Charter into a powerhouse, the second-largest cable operator in the U.S., which significantly increased the value of Liberty Broadband's investment.

6.  **Diversifying with GCI (A Second Key Asset):** In 2020, Liberty Broadband acquired GCI Liberty, which included **GCI**, Alaska's largest communications provider offering data, wireless, and other services. This gave Liberty Broadband a second, wholly-owned operating business in a distinct, high-growth market, further solidifying its position in the telecommunications sector.

### III. Headwinds, Tailwinds, and Innovative Solutions

#### A. Headwinds (Problems and Challenges)

7.  **Slowing Video Business (Headwind):** A major challenge has been the industry-wide trend of "cord-cutting," where customers drop traditional cable TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services. While Charter's internet business thrived, its traditional video subscriber count faced a continuous headwind.

8.  **Heavy Debt from Consolidation (Problem):** The huge acquisitions necessary to form the current Charter Communications required taking on significant debt. Managing and servicing this large debt load is a constant challenge for the underlying asset.

9.  **Competitive Threat (Headwind):** Charter Communications faces intense competition, primarily from phone companies building out high-speed **fiber-optic** networks and, more recently, from wireless companies offering fixed **5G wireless** home internet. These alternatives threaten to take market share from Charter’s cable broadband service.

#### B. Innovative Solutions and Tailwinds (Strategies and Fortune)

10. **Focus on High-Speed Data (Innovative Solution):** The company’s core strategy, executed through Charter, was to shift its focus from the declining cable TV business to the rapidly growing high-speed internet market. This focus on upgrading the network infrastructure to deliver faster, more reliable broadband service became its most successful defense against competitors.

11. **The Indispensable Internet (Tailwind):** Liberty Broadband was extremely fortunate to have its core investment in the broadband sector, which is an essential service. The increasing demand for streaming, remote work, and online gaming meant that high-speed data became a utility, creating a massive, reliable tailwind for subscriber growth and pricing power.

12. **Economies of Scale (Innovative Solution):** The successful strategy of merging multiple cable companies (like Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks) allowed Charter to achieve **economies of scale**. This meant that by combining operations, they could negotiate better prices for programming and equipment and operate more efficiently across a much larger footprint.

### IV. The Present and Future Goal

13. **Generating Shareholder Value (The Ultimate Goal):** Liberty Broadband's main, overarching corporate goal remains the same: to create long-term value for its shareholders through strategic investments. Its primary method of achieving this value is by holding and managing its influential stake in Charter Communications, while also engaging in strategic mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.

14. **The Final Transaction (Present Day):** As of the present, the company is concluding its historical journey. Charter Communications has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. This merger is the final, ultimate realization of the company’s original mission—integrating the strategic investor (Liberty Broadband) with its principal asset (Charter Communications).

15. **Divesting GCI:** As a final step before the merger, Liberty Broadband completed the spin-off of GCI in 2025 to establish it as a separate, independent public company. This move allowed the Charter acquisition to proceed cleanly, focusing on the core cable and broadband investment.

## Moat Analysis

The moat of Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA) is primarily derived from its large ownership and controlling interest in **Charter Communications (Spectrum)**, one of the largest cable and broadband providers in the United States. LBRDA's success is directly tied to the competitive advantages of Charter's core business.

Here is an analysis of the company's moat, differentiation, and position in simple terms:

### The Core Moat (What Makes it Hard to Displace)

1.  **Massive and Cost-Prohibitive Network:** Charter Communications owns an extensive Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC) network that passes over 57 million homes and businesses across 41 states. This infrastructure represents a significant, long-standing investment that a new competitor with even more capital cannot easily or quickly replicate.

2.  **Local Monopoly and Duopoly Advantage:** In most areas, Charter is the sole high-speed cable provider, effectively operating as a monopoly, or competes against just one other fixed-line provider, typically a phone company offering fiber or DSL. This limited competition grants significant market power.

3.  **Low-Cost Path to Competitive Speeds:** Charter is implementing a massive DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade to its existing HFC network, which promises multi-gigabit speeds (up to 10 Gbps download). Crucially, this upgrade costs significantly less per home (estimated around \$100) than fully replacing the network with new fiber, allowing Charter to compete with fiber providers on speed without the same enormous capital outlay.

4.  **Sticky, Recurring Revenue Contracts:** The nature of broadband and TV service provides a stream of highly recurring monthly revenue, not one-time sales. Customers face real and perceived "switching costs," such as returning equipment, transferring email addresses, and coordinating installation, which encourages them to stay.

### Special Position and Differentiation

1.  **Differentiated Product via Bundling and Mobile:** Charter leverages its broadband connection to offer a deeply discounted mobile phone service (Spectrum Mobile) through a network-sharing agreement. Bundling mobile with home internet dramatically increases customer stickiness and product value, creating a significant differentiator against pure-play fiber or fixed wireless competitors.

2.  **Pricing Power through Promotion Roll-Off:** The company exhibits pricing power primarily through a tiered structure where promotional introductory rates expire and "step-up" to a higher regular price, which helps drive consistent residential internet revenue growth despite subscriber volatility. To enhance retention, they also offer bundles with price guarantees of up to three years.

3.  **Economies of Scale in Network and Content:** Operating a massive network across the U.S. allows Charter to spread the costs of network maintenance, technology upgrades (like DOCSIS 4.0), and content acquisition (for TV services) over a very large customer base. This scale creates cost efficiencies that are hard for smaller, regional competitors to match.

### Historical Growth and Displacement Risk

1.  **Historical Growth through Consolidation:** LBRDA's growth is rooted in the strategic vision of its leadership (the Liberty group), who accumulated a massive, influential stake in Charter Communications. This positioned LBRDA to benefit from Charter's own historical growth, which was achieved through large-scale industry consolidation, such as the major mergers that created the massive scale it has today.

2.  **Strategic Investment as a Moat Builder:** The company's ongoing strategy is to continuously invest in its network—a high capital expenditure (CAPEX) business—to maintain its competitive edge against Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH). This continuous innovation, particularly the DOCSIS 4.0 program, is essential to sustain the moat and is how it *invests heavily in R&D* (though the spending is categorized as CAPEX/infrastructure upgrade).

3.  **Displacement is Difficult, Not Impossible:** While a massive capital infusion could fund a complete, competing fiber network in Charter’s footprint, the existing network's low-cost upgrade path makes this a financially difficult proposition for rivals. The primary competition comes from focused fiber providers in specific markets and low-cost Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) from carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon, which pose a threat but lack the capacity for the highest-usage customers.

## Catalyst Analysis

Liberty Broadband Corporation's (LBRDA) stock price is primarily driven by the value of its large ownership stake in Charter Communications (CHTR) and the performance of its wholly-owned subsidiary, GCI (Alaska's leading communications provider).

The company's catalysts fall into two distinct buckets based on major corporate actions announced by management.

### Near-Term Catalysts (H2 2025 - 2026)

1.  **Spin-Off of GCI (GCI Liberty) and Focused Operations:** Liberty Broadband completed the spin-off of its GCI business into a new separate public company, GCI Liberty, Inc., in July 2025, which management states will simplify the equity story of Liberty Broadband.
2.  **Improved Performance at GCI:** The GCI business is showing strong growth in its business data segment, benefiting from an upgrade cycle in school and healthcare services in rural Alaska. Management is also focusing the business by exiting the video segment, which is not expected to significantly impact revenue or free cash flow.
3.  **Reduced Business Uncertainty:** The favorable resolution of the USF (Universal Service Fund) challenge at the Supreme Court definitively removes a long-standing overhang on the GCI business, which was a concern for credit ratings earlier in the year.
4.  **Charter Share Sales and Debt Management:** Liberty Broadband continues to sell a specific number of Charter shares back to Charter monthly, which helps manage its equity interest and provides cash for debt repayment and share repurchases, enhancing financial stability.

### Long-Term Catalysts (2027 and Beyond)

1.  **Definitive Merger with Charter Communications (CHTR):** The most significant long-term catalyst is the definitive, all-stock merger agreement with Charter, where LBRDA shareholders will receive 0.236 shares of CHTR per LBRDA share. The transaction is expected to close on June 30, 2027.
2.  **Value Unlocking from GCI Spin-Off:** The spin-off of GCI Liberty prior to the merger is designed to provide incremental value to Liberty Broadband shareholders that is not captured in the exchange ratio of the Charter deal.
3.  **Growth of Charter Communications:** Since Liberty Broadband's value is heavily tied to its stake in Charter, the long-term success of Charter in the broadband and wireless markets will be the main driver of LBRDA's value until the merger closes.
4.  **Alaska Infrastructure Expansion:** GCI's planned capital expenditures are focused on infrastructure enhancements, particularly middle and last-mile connectivity in rural Alaska, which will help establish a competitive edge and drive long-term market dominance in these areas.

## Management Record

The management analysis of Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA) is heavily influenced by its corporate structure, its principal asset, and a major pending transaction.

### **Key Management and Background**

1.  **Chairman and Founder Influence:** Dr. John C. Malone, a legendary figure in the cable industry and a major shareholder (13.23%), serves as the Chairman of the Board. His career track record includes serving as President and CEO of Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) from 1973 to 1996, highlighting his deep, long-standing expertise and influence in the broadband sector.
2.  **Current CEO:** The current President and CEO is Marty E. Patterson, who was appointed in July 2025. His promotion followed the completion of the GCI Liberty spin-off.
3.  **CEO Background and Tenure:** Mr. Patterson has a long history within the Liberty ecosystem, having been with Liberty Media Corporation and its predecessors since 2010, and also serves as a Senior Vice President of Liberty Media Corporation. His tenure as Liberty Broadband's CEO is currently less than a year.
4.  **Experienced Leadership Team:** The broader management team is generally seasoned and experienced, with an average tenure of 5.5 years, while the board of directors has an average tenure of 8 years.

### **Major Management Changes and Key Decisions**

5.  **Recent CEO Transition:** Mr. Patterson succeeded John C. Malone, who was the former President and CEO. The transition followed a period where Greg Maffei, President & CEO of Liberty Media, also served as President & CEO of Liberty Broadband.
6.  **Former CEO's Key Move (Greg Maffei):** A transformative decision was the November 2024 definitive agreement for Charter Communications to acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. Maffei, then President & CEO, stated the agreement would simplify the corporate structure and allow LBRDA shareholders to participate in Charter’s upside through direct ownership.
7.  **The Spin-Off Strategy:** In connection with the pending Charter acquisition, Liberty Broadband management executed the spin-off of its subsidiary, GCI Liberty, which operates GCI, Alaska’s largest communications provider. This move streamlined the company's assets prior to the merger.
8.  **Historical Value Creation:** The cornerstone of Liberty Broadband’s track record in creating shareholder value is its role as a key investor in Charter Communications, culminating in the Charter acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, which management considered a "game-changing event" that significantly increased the value of Liberty Broadband's investment.

### **Shareholder Value Delivery and Future Strategy**

9.  **Shareholder Value through Charter Merger:** Management's most significant recent action to deliver shareholder value is the agreement with Charter, where LBRDA common stockholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.236 shares of Charter common stock per LBRDA share. This offers LBRDA shareholders direct ownership in the combined entity.
10. **Debt Management in Preparation:** The management executed a strategy for debt repayment in anticipation of the merger, including Charter's agreement to repurchase $100 million of its Class A common stock from Liberty Broadband monthly, with proceeds used for debt service.
11. **Long-Term Vision:** Liberty Broadband’s stated vision is to be a leading strategic investor in the broadband communications sector, driving growth and innovation, and to create long-term value through strategic investments.
12. **Future Outlook (Merger Dependent):** The company's future strategy is primarily centered on the completion of the Charter acquisition, which is expected to close on June 30, 2027, assuming all conditions are met, fundamentally changing the company's nature into a direct holding of Charter shares for its public shareholders.

## Management Incentive

Based on the analysis of Liberty Broadband Corporation's (LBRDA) proxy statements, the management incentive and compensation structure appear to be highly oriented toward long-term shareholder interests.

### **Management Incentive and Compensation Analysis**

1.  **Significant Insider Ownership:** Directors and executive officers have a meaningful beneficial ownership of the company's stock, reportedly in the range of approximately 6% to over 11%. This level of ownership aligns the personal financial interests of the management team directly with the appreciation of the stock value, which is beneficial for shareholders (higher the better).

2.  **Focus on Long-Term Equity:** The company's philosophy is "STOCKHOLDER CENTRIC," with management compensation closely tied to the long-term performance of the stock. This compensation primarily consists of long-term equity incentive awards, such as stock options and Performance Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

3.  **Minimal Cash Compensation for Executives:** Due to a management services agreement with Liberty Media, executive officers (other than the CEO) typically receive little to no cash compensation, relying instead on equity incentives and performance cash bonuses. This structure forces compensation to be heavily dependent on company performance and stock value appreciation, rather than fixed, short-term payouts.

4.  **Incentive Mechanism:** The emphasis on long-term equity, including performance-based equity awards, rewards sustained stock appreciation and operational success over several years, which is the definition of acting in the interest of long-term shareholders.

5.  **Historical Alignment Practices:** The company previously maintained a formal stock ownership guideline that generally required executive officers to own shares equal to at least three times the value of their annual performance RSUs, indicating a historical and structural commitment to management holding significant equity.

### **Conclusion**

**Management is strongly incentivized to act in the interest of the shareholders.**

*   The combination of a significant percentage of insider ownership and a compensation structure dominated by long-term, performance-based equity (stock and stock units) provides a powerful incentive for management to focus on creating sustainable, long-term share price appreciation rather than short-term gains.
*   The minimal cash compensation for most executive officers further reinforces the dependence on long-term stock performance for their personal wealth creation, making it difficult for them to "line their own pockets" without first benefiting all shareholders.

## Price History

Here is an analysis of the price history and technical standing of Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA).

1.  **Current Trading Position Relative to 52-Week Range**
    *   The stock is currently trading at a fraction of its 52-week high of **\$102.38** and is significantly closer to its 52-week low of **\$57.35**.
    *   As of the last reported closing price of approximately \$63.33, Liberty Broadband is trading about **10.43%** above its 52-week low.

2.  **Technical Analysis and Trading Low Assessment**
    *   Based on technical indicators, LBRDA is generally viewed as being in a **bearish phase**.
    *   Many key moving averages (5-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day) were signaling a "Sell" recently, and the overall technical sentiment was leaning heavily toward "Bearish".
    *   Some analyses suggest the stock is trading low and may be considered undervalued, though a short-term forecast predicted a significant potential further drop of over 38% in the three months following September 2025.

## Long Thesis

The bull case for Liberty Broadband is based entirely on its large stake in Charter Communications, the second-largest U.S. cable company, and the coming merger that will combine the two entities. Near term, LBRDA benefits from simplifying its structure by spinning off its Alaska-based business, GCI, which unlocks immediate value and streamlines the company for the ultimate merger. The long-term thesis relies on the success of Charter. Charter possesses a massive, essential internet network that is incredibly expensive for rivals to duplicate. Charter is cheaply upgrading this network (via DOCSIS 4.0 technology) to deliver speeds competitive with fiber, which is crucial for defending its market share against faster rivals. By successfully bundling its internet with its profitable mobile service, Charter retains customers and maintains strong pricing power, ensuring consistent revenue growth and driving LBRDA’s stock value higher until the planned 2027 merger closes.

---

## Long Thesis Assumptions

The definitive, all-stock merger between Liberty Broadband and Charter Communications successfully closes by mid-2027 as planned. Charter successfully executes its low-cost network upgrade plan (DOCSIS 4.0) across its footprint, allowing it to offer speeds competitive with fiber providers, thereby stabilizing or growing its residential internet subscriber base. Competition from emerging threats like Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and fiber network expansion does not significantly erode Charter's overall market share or pricing power in its core territories. The GCI business spin-off successfully unlocks additional, incremental value for LBRDA shareholders prior to the merger.

---

## Bear Case Scenario

The bull case for Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) has several critical holes and relies on optimistic assumptions regarding Charter Communications' competitive position and the financial execution of the corporate events.

## Bear Case Thesis for Liberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA)

1.  **Fundamental Flaw in the Core Business: Broadband Subscriber Erosion and Asymmetric Speed Disadvantage.**
    *   The core assumption that Charter's low-cost DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade will stabilize or grow its residential internet base is contradicted by recent performance, as the company has been losing internet subscribers (e.g., a loss of 60,000 in Q1 2025).
    *   The **DOCSIS 4.0 "low-cost" upgrade is primarily asymmetrical**, meaning upload speeds are significantly slower than download speeds, which is a critical disadvantage against fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) rivals that offer symmetrical multi-gig speeds. This leaves Charter vulnerable to fiber overbuilders and the rapidly growing Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) segment, which is capturing most new broadband customers.

2.  **Corporate Catalyst is a Past Event with a Taxable Outcome, Not a Future Unlock.**
    *   The "immediate value" unlock from the GCI spin-off is no longer a near-term catalyst; **the spin-off has already been completed** (as of July 2025), transforming LBRDA into essentially a publicly-traded holding company for its Charter stake.
    *   The GCI distribution was structured to be **taxable to Liberty Broadband and its stockholders**, which introduces a non-trivial negative factor and complexity not addressed by the bull thesis's simple "value unlock" premise. LBRDA now offers limited upside beyond the exchange ratio discount closing, which is constrained by the long, uncertain merger timeline.

3.  **Extended and Conditional Merger Timeline Creates Uncertainty and Opportunity Cost.**
    *   While a definitive agreement exists, the merger is not expected to close until **June 30, 2027**, or later, meaning the investment must absorb two years of market volatility before the "merger arbitrage" value is realized.
    *   Any negative news or performance from Charter Communications between now and the closing date will directly reduce the value of the all-stock exchange ratio (0.236 shares of CHTR per LBRDA share), as LBRDA's value is purely a function of CHTR's share price.

4.  **Reliance on High-CapEx and Lower-Margin Mobile to Offset Core Weakness.**
    *   The "consistent revenue growth" is increasingly driven by the Mobile segment, which, while growing subscribers rapidly, operates under a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement that typically has **lower margins** than the high-margin, sticky wireline internet service that is facing pressure.
    *   The ongoing DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade and the significant subsidized rural buildout require **elevated capital expenditure (CapEx)**, which acts as a near-term drag on Free Cash Flow (FCF) and limits shareholder return until the CapEx cycle peaks, which is not expected to normalize until post-2027.

## Next Steps

Based on your comprehensive strategic and operational analysis, the next investigative steps should focus on quantifying the financial risks and competitive threats to Charter Communications (CHTR) and assessing the arbitrage opportunity in the Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) merger.

Here are the most important questions and next steps to investigate:

### **Focus 1: Quantifying the Merger Arbitrage and Tax Impact**

1.  **Quantify the Current Arbitrage Spread:** You need the most recent closing prices for LBRDA and CHTR to calculate the dollar difference between LBRDA's market price and its implied value (CHTR Price $\times 0.236$ exchange ratio). This spread is the potential reward for holding LBRDA until the 2027 closing, balanced against the two-year time risk.
2.  **Determine the Value of the GCI Spin-Off (GCI Liberty):** Since the spin-off is complete (July 2025), you need to find the market value (or a reasonable valuation) of the GCI Liberty shares received per LBRDA share (0.20 shares of GCI Liberty per LBRDA share) to calculate the actual proceeds and final asset value of LBRDA post-spin.
3.  **Analyze the Tax Liability of the GCI Spin-Off:** Confirm the estimated tax consequence of the GCI spin-off to LBRDA shareholders, as the deal structure intends to treat the GCI distribution as a taxable transaction ("boot" in a plan of reorganization). This is a critical factor in net returns.

### **Focus 2: Validating Charter's Moat & Competitive Defense**

4.  **Track DOCSIS 4.0 Deployment and Effectiveness:** Investigate current, market-specific reports or management updates to see if the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade (asymmetrical Extended Spectrum DOCSIS - ESD) is stemming the customer losses in those initial deployment areas. Note that the target completion date for the rollout has already slipped from 2025 to 2026 due to equipment certification delays.
5.  **Assess the Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Threat:** Search for current data on subscriber net additions/losses for Charter versus T-Mobile and Verizon in overlapping markets to quantify the real-time pressure from FWA, which the bear case highlights as a major weakness.
6.  **Evaluate CHTR's Long-Term Free Cash Flow (FCF) Profile:** The bear case points to CapEx as a drag. Confirm the CapEx forecast, which is expected to peak around \$12 billion in 2025 and then decline toward \$8 billion by 2028, and analyze the projected acceleration of FCF post-2025. This FCF trajectory is the single biggest driver of CHTR's (and therefore LBRDA's) value.

### **Focus 3: Financial Health and Valuation of the Core Asset (CHTR)**

7.  **Calculate Key Valuation Metrics for CHTR:** Obtain key metrics like the current EV/EBITDA and Forward P/E ratio for Charter Communications to compare it to its peers (e.g., Comcast/CMCSA). This will help determine if CHTR is currently undervalued/overvalued, which impacts the potential upside of the LBRDA position.
8.  **Analyze Charter's Debt and Leverage:** The company's total principal debt was around \$93.8 to \$94.3 billion in late 2024/mid-2025, and management targets a leverage ratio of 3.5x to 4.0x EBITDA. Assess how much of CHTR's FCF must go to servicing this substantial debt load before it can be returned to shareholders.
