## **1. Core Financial Data & Balance Sheet (as of Q3 2025)**

The following figures are derived directly or implied from the Matador Resources Company's latest Q3 2025 earnings release, which references the 10-Q filing.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | **\$50.0 million** | The Q3 2025 materials do not explicitly state the Cash & Equivalents balance. The company emphasizes prioritizing debt paydown and capital flexibility over a large cash hoard. A conservative, round figure is assumed, acknowledging that E&P companies generally keep cash minimal. |
| **Total Debt** | **\$2,401.5 million** | Comprised of Senior Unsecured Notes Payable, which totaled approximately \$2,116.5 million as of Q1 2025, and the reduced Revolving Credit Facility (RBL) balance of \$285 million as of September 30, 2025. (2,116.5 + 285 = 2,401.5). |
| **Shares Outstanding** | **124.0 million** | Based on the Q1 2025 outstanding shares (125.2 million) adjusted for the 1.3 million shares repurchased as of October 2025. |
| **Current Stock Price** | **\$45.02** | Latest closing price as of the date of search. |

## **2. Business Engine and Revenue Projection**

Matador's business engine is driven by its upstream Oil & Gas production, primarily in the Permian Basin (Delaware Basin), complemented by its midstream segment (San Mateo Midstream). Revenue is a function of production volume and realized commodity prices.

### **A. Business Engine Assumptions**

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-Term Oil Price (bbl)** | **\$75.00** | A conservative long-term price assumption, below recent market highs but well above the company's stated break-even/high-return threshold (\$50/bbl for 50%+ ROR wells). |
| **Long-Term Gas Price (mcf)** | **\$3.50** | Based on management's stated 2026 gas hedge floor, which provides a conservative, downside-protected price for modeling [cite: 9, Step 2]. |
| **Production Growth Rate** | **3.5% (2026), tapering to 1.5%** | Management explicitly guided to **2% to 5% organic growth** for 2026. A conservative midpoint of **3.5%** is used for 2026, supported by 10% longer laterals and reduced well costs ($855/ft). This is then conservatively tapered down, reflecting a mature E&P company post-acquisition growth surge. |
| **Net Income Margin** | **18.0%** | The Q3 2025 Net Income of \$176 million on Total Revenue of \$939 million yields an 18.7% margin. A conservative, round **18.0%** is used to account for price volatility and cost fluctuations, relying on management's consistent focus on operational efficiencies and cost reductions. |
| **Return on Invested Cash (ROIC)** | **8.0%** | A conservative but reasonable return, given Matador's access to high-return (>50%) drilling inventory. This is slightly lower than some historical TTM estimates (9-11%) to maintain conservatism. |

### **B. Projected Revenue and Net Income (in millions USD)**

The **2025 Revenue** is estimated at **\$3,600M**, a conservative estimate below the annualized Q3 2025 run rate (4 x \$939M = \$3,756M) to account for earlier-year lumpiness.

| Year | Revenue Growth Rate | Projected Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (B) (A * Margin) | Retained Cash (Prev Yr.) | ROIC Income (C) (8% * Cash) | Total Net Income (B + C) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | N/A | \$3,600 | 18.0% | \$648 | \$0 | \$0 | **\$648** |
| **2026** | 3.5% | \$3,726 | 18.0% | \$671 | \$648 | \$52 | **\$723** |
| **2027** | 3.0% | \$3,838 | 18.0% | \$691 | \$1,371 | \$110 | **\$801** |
| **2028** | 2.5% | \$3,934 | 18.0% | \$708 | \$2,172 | \$174 | **\$882** |
| **2029** | 2.0% | \$4,013 | 18.0% | \$722 | \$3,054 | \$244 | **\$966** |
| **2030** | 1.5% | \$4,073 | 18.0% | \$733 | \$4,020 | \$322 | **\$1,055** |

*Note: Retained Cash for the next year is calculated as: *Retained Cash (Current Year) = Retained Cash (Previous Year) + Total Net Income (Current Year)*.

## **3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

The projected cash flow (using Net Income as a proxy for cash flow) is discounted to its Net Present Value (NPV).

### **A. Discount and Terminal Value Assumptions**

| Metric | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (WACC)** | **10.0%** | A reasonable and conservative discount rate for a cyclical, capital-intensive E&P company with significant debt. |
| **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth)**| **2.0%** | A very conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting that a mature oil company's production is difficult to grow beyond GDP/inflation, even with good inventory. |

### **B. DCF Calculation (in millions USD)**

| Year | Total Net Income (Cash Flow) | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$648 | 0.9091 | \$589 |
| **2026** | \$723 | 0.8264 | \$598 |
| **2027** | \$801 | 0.7513 | \$602 |
| **2028** | \$882 | 0.6830 | \$602 |
| **2029** | \$966 | 0.6209 | \$600 |
| **2030** | \$1,055 | 0.5645 | \$596 |
| **NPV of Explicit Period (2025-2030)** | | | **\$3,587** |

### **C. Terminal Value**

The cash flow for the terminal year (2030) is grown perpetually at the conservative maturity rate (2.0%) and discounted back to the present.

*   Terminal Year Cash Flow: \$1,055 million
*   Terminal Value at 2030: \$1,055 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.10 - 0.02) = \$13,473.75 million
*   NPV of Terminal Value: \$13,473.75 * 0.5645 = **\$7,605 million**

### **D. Total Enterprise Value (EV)**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| NPV of Explicit Period Cash Flow (2025-2030) | \$3,587 |
| NPV of Terminal Value | \$7,605 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (TEV)** | **\$11,192** |

---

## **4. Fair Value Calculation**

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated by adjusting the Enterprise Value for cash and debt.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Enterprise Value (TEV) | \$11,192.0 |
| Less: Total Debt | (\$2,401.5) |
| Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents | \$50.0 |
| **Total Equity Value** | **\$8,840.5** |
| Shares Outstanding (in millions) | 124.0 |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **\$71.30** |

---

## **5. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value Per Share:** **\$71.30**
**Current Market Price:** **\$45.02**

The calculated fair value of **\$71.30** per share is significantly higher than the current market price of **\$45.02**. This suggests the stock is **undervalued** by the market based on the conservative assumptions used in this DCF model.

### **Justification for the Valuation Difference**

The difference between the intrinsic value and the market price stems from the market making significantly different, more conservative assumptions about future cash flows, primarily regarding the **commodity price deck** and the **sustainability of growth**.

1.  **Commodity Price Conservatism (Market vs. Model):**
    *   The model uses a mid-cycle, conservative price deck (**\$75/bbl oil, \$3.50/mcf gas**) that is still supported by management's stated economics (50%+ ROR at \$50/bbl). The market, particularly for E&P companies, often embeds a lower long-term commodity price (e.g., \$60/bbl oil) in its valuation due to the cyclical and volatile nature of energy prices.
2.  **Discounting of Growth:**
    *   The model's growth assumptions (**3.5% for 2026, tapering to 1.5%**) are directly supported by management's **2-5% organic growth guidance** and projected cost efficiencies. The market may heavily discount this growth, assuming a quicker fade due to potential recession, future CapEx increases, or reserve depletion, which is a constant challenge for E&P companies.
3.  **Valuation of Midstream Assets (San Mateo):**
    *   Management has repeatedly stated their belief that the value of their midstream segment, San Mateo Midstream, is **"not fully realized in Matador’s current share price"** [cite: 8, Step 2]. The midstream business typically trades at a higher multiple due to its stable, fee-based cash flows. By using a single blended Net Income Margin (18.0%), this DCF model may not fully capture the higher, more stable value of the midstream segment, and the market is likely also failing to credit this value.
4.  **ROIC and Cash Generation:**
    *   The model gives credit to the company's high ROIC opportunity by projecting an **8.0% return on retained cash** being reinvested in high-return wells (>50% ROR). This compounding effect adds significant value in the outer years. The market, by focusing on current P/E or free cash flow, often fails to fully appreciate the value of an extensive, highly-economic inventory (2,000+ high-return locations) that can sustain returns on capital over a long period.

**Conclusion:** The market's assumptions are overly conservative, likely pricing in a substantially lower long-term commodity price and a higher risk premium on Matador's ability to sustain its planned organic growth and operational efficiencies, particularly overlooking the value of the integrated midstream business and high-return drilling inventory. The DCF model suggests the market is under-appreciating Matador's future profitability and capital efficiency.
