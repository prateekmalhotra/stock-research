### II. Business Engine Analysis & Revenue Projections

The business engine for an Exploration & Production (E&P) company like MTDR is primarily driven by **production volume growth** and **realized commodity prices**. MTDR has a secondary revenue stream from its wholly-owned midstream assets, San Mateo Midstream, LLC.

#### A. Key Business Engine Assumptions (Conservative)

1.  **Production Volume Growth:**
    *   **2025 (Full Year):** The company is on track for record production. Total BOE production averaged 209,184 BOE/day in Q3 2025. Management is guiding for **20% total BOE production growth for full-year 2025** compared to 2024, with average daily BOE production of 205,000 BOE/day. This guidance is used.
    *   **2026:** Management is targeting a conservative organic growth of **2% to 5%** in production, driven by operational efficiencies like $50M-$60M in capital savings and 10% longer lateral lengths. I will use the **midpoint of 3.5%** for production growth in 2026.
    *   **2027 - 2030 (Maturity Phase):** Given the mandate for conservative assumptions in a commodity-driven business, and the likelihood of capital discipline limiting aggressive, high-cost growth in out-years, I assume organic production growth slows to a **conservative 1.0% per year** after 2026.

2.  **Commodity Price (WTI) Assumption:**
    *   WTI crude oil prices are the single largest driver of revenue. To maintain a **conservative maturity rate**, I adopt a long-term declining price deck, reflecting the energy transition risk and potential for non-OPEC+ oversupply, which is a key risk cited in management discussions. The long-term price is stabilized at a conservative $55/bbl.

| Year | WTI Price (USD/bbl) (Conservative Assumption) | Production Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (Q4 Avg.) | **$65.00** | 20.0% (Management Guidance) |
| **2026** | **$62.00** | 3.5% (Midpoint of Mgmt. Organic Guidance) |
| **2027** | **$60.00** | 1.0% (Conservative Maturity Rate) |
| **2028** | **$58.00** | 1.0% (Conservative Maturity Rate) |
| **2029** | **$56.00** | 1.0% (Conservative Maturity Rate) |
| **2030** | **$55.00** | 1.0% (Conservative Maturity Rate) |

3.  **Revenue Projection Calculation:**
    *   **Revenue 2025:** Based on the $3.24B (2024 Revenue) and the 20% production growth, the implied price decline from 2024 to 2025 is factored in. I use the $939M for Q3 2025 and extrapolate the full year based on the production growth and management guidance.
    *   **Midstream Revenue (San Mateo):** Midstream operations contribute an increasing, stable revenue stream. Management guides for $40M-$50M in 2026 Adjusted EBITDA. I conservatively assume midstream revenue adds **$250 million** annually (based on 2024's $3.24B revenue being primarily E&P, and midstream revenue being a smaller component) and grows at a modest **3%** per year, in line with midstream guidance.

#### B. Projected Annual Revenue (in millions USD)

| Year | Production Growth | Price Effect (Conservative) | Revenue Growth Rate | Midstream Adj. (Approx.) | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | **$3,240** |
| **2025** | 20.0% | Moderate Decline | 10.0% | $250 | **$3,564** |
| **2026** | 3.5% | Price -4.6% | -1.1% | $258 | **$3,525** |
| **2027** | 1.0% | Price -3.2% | -2.2% | $266 | **$3,448** |
| **2028** | 1.0% | Price -3.3% | -2.3% | $275 | **$3,369** |
| **2029** | 1.0% | Price -3.4% | -2.4% | $283 | **$3,289** |
| **2030** | 1.0% | Price -1.8% | -0.8% | $291 | **$3,263** |

### III. Margin and Net Income Projections

#### A. Historical Margin Analysis

*   **2024 Net Income:** $885.32 million (from Step 1)
*   **2024 Net Income Margin:** $885.32M / $3,240M = **27.3%**
*   **Q3 2025 Net Income Margin:** $176M / $939M = **18.7%**

The Q3 2025 margin drop reflects the volatility and lower realized prices for oil and natural gas during the quarter. The **average of the 2024 high margin and the Q3 2025 lower margin is 23.0%**.

#### B. Projected Net Income Margin (Conservative)

I will use a **conservative, steady-state Net Income Margin of 20.0%** for all projected years (2025-2030). This is below the 2024 full-year margin and assumes ongoing commodity price pressure and increased operating costs offset by the company's continuous operational efficiency gains, such as a lower well cost midpoint of $844 per foot.

#### C. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

As a conservative measure for E&P, a stable and positive ROIC is a strong indicator of management quality and operational efficiency. Management has explicitly stated that new wells in the 2025 capital plan have expected **rates of return exceeding 50%**.
*   **Historical ROIC:** Calculating precise historical GAAP ROIC is complex without detailed NOPAT and invested capital figures from the full 10-K/10-Q. However, given the *expected* returns on new capital are over 50% and the business is highly profitable, a long-term ROIC of **15.0%** for the cash retained (Net Income rolled over) is a very conservative and reasonable estimate, well below the company's expected well returns.

#### D. Projected Net Income (in millions USD)

The model follows the rule: Net Income(n) = Projected Revenue * 20.0% Margin + ROIC * Retained Cash(n-1).

| Year | Total Revenue | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income | Retained Cash (Beg.) | ROIC % | ROIC Income | **Total Net Income** | **Retained Cash (End)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3,564 | 20.0% | $713 | $0 | 15.0% | $0 | **$713** | $713 |
| **2026** | $3,525 | 20.0% | $705 | $713 | 15.0% | $107 | **$812** | $1,525 |
| **2027** | $3,448 | 20.0% | $690 | $1,525 | 15.0% | $229 | **$919** | $2,444 |
| **2028** | $3,369 | 20.0% | $674 | $2,444 | 15.0% | $367 | **$1,041** | $3,485 |
| **2029** | $3,289 | 20.0% | $658 | $3,485 | 15.0% | $523 | **$1,181** | $4,666 |
| **2030** | $3,263 | 20.0% | $653 | $4,666 | 15.0% | $700 | **$1,353** | $6,019 |

### IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

The Net Income stream will be used as the proxy for free cash flow to equity (FCFE), as per the assumption that net income goes straight into cash.

#### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** I use a high discount rate of **10.0%**. This reflects the volatility and geopolitical risk inherent in the E&P sector, a higher rate than a stable-growth company, thus maintaining conservatism.
*   **Conservative Maturity Rate (Long-Term Growth):** The business is in a mature, cyclical industry (Oil & Gas). I assume a very conservative, long-term sustainable growth rate for cash flows (Terminal Growth Rate) of **0.0%** (i.e., the business merely holds its 2030 cash flow in perpetuity).

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year (n) | Total Net Income (FCFE) (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^n) | Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** (n=1) | $713 | 0.909 | $648 |
| **2026** (n=2) | $812 | 0.826 | $671 |
| **2027** (n=3) | $919 | 0.751 | $690 |
| **2028** (n=4) | $1,041 | 0.683 | $711 |
| **2029** (n=5) | $1,181 | 0.621 | $733 |
| **2030** (n=6) | $1,353 | 0.564 | $763 |
| **Terminal Value** | $\frac{\text{FCFE}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{WACC} - \text{g}} = \frac{\$1,353 \times (1+0.00)}{0.10 - 0.00} = \$13,530$ | 0.564 | $7,633 |
| **Sum of NPV** | | | **$11,850** |

**Total Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows = $11,850 million**

---

### V. Fair Value Calculation

The final calculation of fair value per share is performed using the balance sheet equation:
$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$
$$\text{Fair Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Equity Value}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $11,850 |
| **Add: Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $20 |
| **Less: Total Debt** | $2,435 |
| **Equity Value** | **$9,435 million** |
| **Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | 124.38 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | $\frac{\$9,435 \text{ million}}{124.38 \text{ million}} = \mathbf{\$75.86}$ |

---

### VI. Conclusion and Market Comparison

**Fair Value per Share (Calculated):** **$75.86**
**Current Stock Price (Market Value):** **$39.31**

#### Justification for the Difference

My calculated Fair Value of **$75.86** is approximately **93% higher** than the current market price of $39.31. This significant difference suggests the market is making far more conservative assumptions than even my own, or is applying a much greater discount for risk.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions vs. My Model:**

1.  **Lower Long-Term Commodity Prices:** The market is likely pricing MTDR on a significantly lower long-term commodity price deck. My model uses an *average* WTI price of $58.83/bbl across the projection period (2025-2030). The market is likely modeling a sustained WTI price in the **low $50s or high $40s** to justify the current price, or is using an extremely high discount rate for the cash flows beyond 2026.
2.  **Higher Discount Rate (Risk Premium):** The market's valuation implies a much higher discount rate than my conservative **10.0%**. This is a reflection of high uncertainty regarding the geopolitical risk and the long-term outlook for fossil fuels due to the energy transition. The market is pricing in the *risk of obsolescence* beyond the mid-term.
3.  **Lower Profitability (Margin):** The market may be projecting a lower Net Income Margin than my conservative **20.0%**. Given the Q3 2025 margin was 18.7% due to lower realized prices, the market may be projecting this lower-margin, higher-cost environment to persist, negating the management's guidance on efficiency gains.
4.  **No Terminal Value Growth (or even decline):** While my model assumes a very conservative **0.0%** terminal growth rate, the market's valuation suggests an assumption of a *negative* terminal growth rate, reflecting a belief that MTDR's cash flows will decline post-2030 as global oil demand plateaus and begins to fall.

**My Case for the Higher Valuation:**

My model is justified because it is grounded in **Management's clearly communicated operational engine** and the *realized* high-profitability of the company.
*   **Strong Balance Sheet/ROIC:** My model incorporates the fact that Matador has an excellent balance sheet (low leverage ratio of 0.4x is noted in the transcripts) and is generating highly profitable new projects with expected rates of return *exceeding 50%*. The market seems to be ignoring the significant value creation of the integrated upstream/midstream model (San Mateo Midstream value not "fully realized" in stock price) and the high returns on invested capital.
*   **Conservative Margins and Price:** My margin (20.0%) and price deck are highly conservative. If oil prices stabilize even slightly above the $55 long-term floor (e.g., at $65/bbl), the intrinsic value would align with my calculated fair value. The market is essentially pricing Matador for an **Oil & Gas recession** that does not yet appear imminent, even with conservative long-term price forecasts. The market is disproportionately discounting the stock for macro commodity price risk, ignoring the company's low-cost structure and proven operational efficiency.
