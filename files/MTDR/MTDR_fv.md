## I. Financial Data & Assumptions

### A. Balance Sheet and Shares Outstanding

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $20$ | From Q3 2025 earnings release, noted as "available cash" in the Net Debt calculation. This is a very conservative liquid cash figure. |
| **Total Debt** | $2,489$ | **Calculation:** Senior Notes ($2,150M) + RBL Borrowings ($285M) + Outstanding Letters of Credit ($54M) from Q3 2025 release. |
| **Shares Outstanding (Diluted)** | $124.27$ | Used a recent, precise figure for shares outstanding. |
| **Current Stock Price** | $43.00 | Conservative figure used for comparison. |
| **Base Year Revenue (FY 2024)** | $3,500$ | Based on full-year 2024 reported revenue of $\sim\$3.5$ billion. |

### B. Business Engine & Revenue Forecast Assumptions

Matador Resources' primary business engine is oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) in the liquids-rich Delaware Basin, complemented by its integrated midstream segment (San Mateo Midstream). Revenue growth is driven by increasing production volumes (through successful drilling/completion and acquisitions) and commodity prices.

**Engine Assumptions based on Management Commentary:**

1.  **2025 Growth Rate (Inorganic & Accelerated Organic):** The Company guided for aggressive year-over-year production growth in 2025, suggesting $\sim30\%$ growth in Q1 and Q2, and $20\%+$ for Q3, driven by the Ameredev acquisition and the acceleration of wells. A conservative, blended full-year revenue growth is estimated at **$20.0\%$** from the FY 2024 baseline.
2.  **2026 Growth Rate (Organic):** Management projects a more moderate **$3.5\%$** organic production growth (midpoint of the $2\%-5\%$ guidance range) following the accelerated 2025 activity, reflecting sustainable drilling economics.
3.  **Long-Term Growth Rate (2027-2030):** The E&P business is fundamentally a depleting asset business. While Matador has a strong inventory with high rates of return ($>50\%$ at $50 oil), a conservative estimate assumes this organic growth rate will gradually moderate to reflect the capital-intensive nature and maturity of the industry.
    *   2027-2028: **$3.0\%$**
    *   2029-2030: **$2.5\%$**
4.  **Terminal Growth Rate (G):** A conservative long-term growth rate for a mature E&P company in a cyclical commodity industry is set at **$2.0\%$**.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Revenue Growth Rate | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Actual)** | $3,500$ | - | Base year. |
| **2025 (Projected)** | $4,200$ | $20.0\%$ | Conservative estimate based on strong Q1-Q3 2025 Y/Y production growth guidance ($\sim20\%-30\%$), boosted by M&A and accelerated drilling. |
| **2026 (Projected)** | $4,347$ | $3.5\%$ | Midpoint of management's organic growth guidance for 2026 ($2\%-5\%$) after the 2025 acceleration. |
| **2027 (Projected)** | $4,477$ | $3.0\%$ | Conservative moderation of growth. |
| **2028 (Projected)** | $4,611$ | $3.0\%$ | Conservative moderation of growth. |
| **2029 (Projected)** | $4,726$ | $2.5\%$ | Conservative moderation of growth. |
| **2030 (Projected)** | $4,844$ | $2.5\%$ | Conservative moderation of growth. |

## II. Profitability and Net Income Projections

### A. Margin and ROIC Assumptions

1.  **Net Income Margin:** Full-year 2024 Net Income Margin was approximately $25.3\%$ ($885.3M Net Income on $\sim\$3.5B$ Revenue). Management anticipates significant cost synergies ($>150$ million over five years) and reduced operating expenses (35\% LOE reduction on Ameredev) which should support healthy margins. I will conservatively assume a **$25.0\%$** stable Net Income Margin across the projection period, slightly below historical levels to account for potential commodity price volatility and increasing capital/service costs over the long term.
2.  **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** Historical TTM ROIC is approximately $10.0\%$ to $11.1\%$. The business shows efficient use of capital (wells yielding $>50\%$ returns at $50 oil). I will use a conservative, perpetual **$10.0\%$** ROIC on the accumulated cash/retained earnings from prior years. This assumes all Net Income is retained as cash and reinvested to generate additional income.

### B. Projected Net Income Calculation

| Year | Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income (B) = A * 25.0% | Prior Year Cash | ROIC (10.0%) on Prior Year Cash (C) | Total Net Income (D) = B + C |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial (End of 2024)** | - | - | - | $885$ | - | - |
| **2025** | $4,200$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,050$ | $885$ | $88$ | $1,138$ |
| **2026** | $4,347$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,087$ | $2,023$ | $202$ | $1,289$ |
| **2027** | $4,477$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,119$ | $3,312$ | $331$ | $1,450$ |
| **2028** | $4,611$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,153$ | $4,762$ | $476$ | $1,629$ |
| **2029** | $4,726$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,181$ | $6,391$ | $639$ | $1,820$ |
| **2030** | $4,844$ | $25.0\%$ | $1,211$ | $8,211$ | $821$ | $2,032$ |
| **Terminal Value** | - | - | - | $10,243$ | - | - |

*   *Note: Prior Year Cash for Year $N$ is the sum of Net Income from all years prior to $N$ plus the initial FY 2024 Net Income of $885.3M$ (rounded to $885M$ for simplicity) - based on the rule that "net income for each year goes straight into cash for the next year."*
    *   *Prior Year Cash 2026 = $885$ (2024 NI) + $1,138$ (2025 NI) = $2,023$*
    *   *Prior Year Cash 2027 = $2,023$ + $1,289$ (2026 NI) = $3,312$, etc.*

## III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** A reasonable and conservative discount rate (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) for an E&P company is assumed to be **$9.0\%$**. This is higher than a historical WACC reference in search results of $8.74\%$ to maintain conservatism.
2.  **Maturity Rate (Perpetual Growth Rate, G):** A very conservative **$2.0\%$** is used, reflecting a growth rate slightly above the long-term inflation rate, appropriate for a mature, capital-intensive industry.

The cash flow for the DCF is assumed to be the **Total Net Income (D)** for the purposes of this model, as requested, which assumes Net Income is a reasonable proxy for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) given the "goes straight into cash" rule.

**Terminal Value (TV) in 2030:**
*   $TV = (\text{Last Year's Cash Flow} * (1 + G)) / (\text{Discount Rate} - G)$
*   $TV = (\$2,032 \text{ million} * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.09 - 0.02)$
*   $TV = \$2,072.64 \text{ million} / 0.07$
*   $TV = \$29,609$ million

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Total Net Income (D) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (PV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (t=1)** | $1,138$ | $0.9174$ | $1,044$ |
| **2026 (t=2)** | $1,289$ | $0.8417$ | $1,085$ |
| **2027 (t=3)** | $1,450$ | $0.7722$ | $1,119$ |
| **2028 (t=4)** | $1,629$ | $0.7084$ | $1,154$ |
| **2029 (t=5)** | $1,820$ | $0.6499$ | $1,183$ |
| **2030 (t=6)** | $2,032$ | $0.5963$ | $1,211$ |
| **Terminal Value (t=6)** | $29,609$ | $0.5963$ | $17,665$ |
| **Sum of PVs (NPV)** | | | **$24,461$** |

*   *Note: Present Value is rounded to the nearest million for table display.*

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows = $24,461$ million**

---

## IV. Fair Value Calculation

1.  **Equity Value:**
    *   $\text{Equity Value} = \text{NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$
    *   $\text{Equity Value} = \$24,461 \text{ million} + \$20 \text{ million} - \$2,489 \text{ million}$
    *   $\text{Equity Value} = \$21,992$ million

2.  **Fair Value per Share:**
    *   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \text{Equity Value} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$
    *   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$21,992 \text{ million} / 124.27 \text{ million shares}$
    *   $\text{Fair Value per Share} = \$177.08$

## V. Conclusion and Justification

### Fair Value of Matador Resources Company Stock

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value per Share** | **$177.08** |
| **Current Stock Price (Market Value)** | **$43.00** |

### Justification of Valuation and Market Discrepancy

The calculated fair value of **$177.08** is significantly higher (over $4$ times) than the current market price of approximately **$43.00**. This large discrepancy implies that the market is making much more conservative assumptions about Matador's future performance than those derived from the management's commentary and historical profitability.

**Reasons for the Discrepancy (Why the Market is More Conservative):**

1.  **Commodity Price Risk:** The biggest risk for an E&P company is commodity price volatility. While the model assumes a stable $25.0\%$ Net Income Margin, the market likely projects a sharp decline in commodity prices (oil and gas) over the $2025-2030$ forecast, which would severely erode revenue and net income. A lower average oil and gas price assumption in the DCF would drastically reduce the $\text{NPV}$.
2.  **Sustainability of Growth/Capex:** The market may doubt the sustainability of the projected $20.0\%$ growth in 2025 and the subsequent organic growth rates without a corresponding increase in capital expenditure (CapEx). While the management is touting high-return wells and cost synergies, the market may assume higher future CapEx is needed to maintain production (given depletion) which would reduce the FCF proxy (Net Income).
3.  **Net Income as Proxy for FCFE:** Using Net Income as a direct proxy for cash flow to equity ($\text{FCFE}$) is a major source of model-market discrepancy, especially for an E&P company. True FCFE is calculated as:
    $$ \text{Net Income} + \text{D\&A} - \text{CapEx} - \text{Change in Working Capital} - \text{Debt Repayments} $$
    Since E&P companies have high Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization (D&A) and high CapEx, the true FCFE is almost certainly *much lower* than the Net Income used in this model. For example, for full-year 2024, Net Cash from Operations was $\$2.25$ billion, but Adjusted Free Cash Flow was only $\$807.3$ million. This means the actual cash flow is $\sim64\%$ lower than the Net Income in the base year alone.

**Conclusion on Discrepancy:**

The model's high valuation is primarily driven by the explicit rule of assuming **Net Income goes straight into cash for the next year** and then using this Net Income as the cash flow for DCF. In a capital-intensive industry like E&P, where $\text{Net Income} \neq \text{Free Cash Flow}$, this rule creates a significant overvaluation.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions:**

Assuming the market is valuing MTDR at $\$43.00$ per share, its implied equity value is approximately $\$5.34$ billion ($124.27M * \$43.00$).

$$\text{Implied Equity Value} = \$5,340 \text{ million}$$

This suggests the market is discounting the future cash flows by a factor that would yield a much lower $\text{NPV}$ of only $\mathbf{\$7,809 \text{ million}}$ (i.e., $\text{NPV} = \text{Equity Value} - \text{Cash} + \text{Debt}$). The market's valuation is likely based on an average annual Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) of $\sim\$550-\$600$ million, which is in line with the lower, more realistic cash flow figures reported by the company.
