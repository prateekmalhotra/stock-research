## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

The core business engine for Goosehead is driven by **Total Written Premiums (WP)**, which converts into revenue through commissions and franchise royalties. The franchise channel, which generates high-margin royalty fees, is a key focus for long-term profitable growth.

### A. Revenue Driver Assumptions

| Metric | 2025 Est. | 2026 Assump. | 2027 Assump. | 2028 Assump. | 2029 Assump. | 2030 Assump. | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Written Premium (WP) Growth Rate** | 18.5% | 18.0% | 16.0% | 14.0% | 12.0% | 10.0% | 2025 is the midpoint of the 15-22% guidance range. 2026 is at 18% based on management anticipating acceleration through 2026. Decelerates to a conservative 10% maturity rate. |
| **WP (USD Millions)** | $4,515.0 | $5,327.7 | $6,179.1 | $7,044.2 | $7,889.5 | $8,678.4 | Calculated based on the growth rate applied to the prior year's WP. 2025 is the midpoint of guidance ($4.38B to $4.65B). |
| **Revenue / WP Conversion Rate** | 8.14% | 8.14% | 8.14% | 8.14% | 8.14% | 8.14% | Calculated as 2025 midpoint Revenue ($367.5M) / 2025 midpoint WP ($4,515.0M). This is assumed to remain constant for a conservative estimate. |
| **Total Revenue (USD Millions)** | $367.5 | $433.6 | $502.8 | $573.5 | $642.3 | $707.0 | Total WP multiplied by the constant 8.14% conversion rate. |

## 3. Net Income and Discounted Cash Flow (2025-2030)

### A. Net Income and ROIC Assumptions

*   **Net Income Margin:** The Q3 2025 Net Income Margin was 14%. Management is focused on margin expansion through the high-margin franchise channel. A conservative Net Income Margin is projected to expand from 10% (lower than current) in 2025 to 20% in 2030, reflecting operational leverage and business mix shift.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Historical ROIC is high (28.00% LTM). I will use a very conservative and sustained **10.0%** ROIC on the prior year's Net Income (retained cash flow) to generate additional income in the following year, which is a key instruction for this valuation.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A conservative 9.0% is used to discount future cash flows, reflecting the company's growth-stock profile, volatility, and execution risk.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** A very conservative 2.5% is used for the perpetuity calculation, slightly above long-term inflation.

### B. DCF Calculation Table

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | $367.5 | $433.6 | $502.8 | $573.5 | $642.3 | $707.0 |
| **Net Income Margin (%)** | 10.0% | 12.0% | 14.0% | 16.0% | 18.0% | 20.0% |
| **Net Income from Operations (A)** | $36.8 | $52.0 | $70.4 | $91.8 | $115.6 | $141.4 |
| **Prior Year Cash Flow (B)** | $0.0 | $36.8 | $88.8 | $159.2 | $251.0 | $366.6 |
| **ROIC (10.0%) from Prior Cash (C) = B * 10.0%** | $0.0 | $3.7 | $8.9 | $15.9 | $25.1 | $36.7 |
| **Total Cash Flow (D) = A + C** | $36.8 | $55.7 | $79.3 | $107.7 | $140.7 | $178.1 |
| **Cumulative Cash Flow (E)** | $36.8 | $92.5 | $171.7 | $279.4 | $420.1 | $598.2 |
| **Discount Factor (9.0%)** | 0.9174 | 0.8417 | 0.7722 | 0.7084 | 0.6499 | 0.5963 |
| **NPV of Cash Flow** | $33.7 | $46.9 | $61.2 | $76.3 | $91.4 | $106.1 |
| **Cumulative NPV** | $33.7 | $80.6 | $141.8 | $218.1 | $309.5 | **$415.6** |

### C. Terminal Value Calculation

The cash flow for 2031 is projected for the terminal value calculation.

*   2031 Total Revenue: $707.0 * (1 + 10.0%) = $777.7
*   2031 Net Income Margin: 20.0% (Stable)
*   2031 Net Income from Operations: $777.7 * 20.0% = $155.5
*   2031 ROIC from Prior Cash (2030 Cumulative Cash Flow): $598.2 * 10.0% = $59.8
*   **2031 Total Cash Flow (CF_T):** $155.5 + $59.8 = **$215.3**

The Gordon Growth Model is used for Terminal Value (TV):

$$TV = \frac{CF_T \times (1 + g)}{r - g} = \frac{\$215.3 \times (1 + 0.025)}{0.09 - 0.025} = \frac{\$220.7}{0.065} = \$3,395.4$$

*   **NPV of Terminal Value (Discounted to today):**
    $NPV_{TV} = TV \times Discount\ Factor_{2030} = \$3,395.4 \times 0.5963 = \mathbf{\$2,024.1}$

## 5. Fair Value & Market Comparison

**Fair Value Per Share: $60.43**

**Current Market Price: $67.71**

The calculated Fair Value of **$60.43** is **10.7% lower** than the Current Market Price of $67.71.

### Justification for Difference

The market is valuing Goosehead at a premium to this conservative DCF valuation. This suggests the market is making more optimistic assumptions about the company's future growth and profitability.

**Market Assumptions vs. Valuation Assumptions:**

1.  **Higher Growth Rate:** The market likely believes the Total Written Premium growth will not decelerate as quickly as assumed (from 18% to 10% by 2030). The market may be factoring in management's stated goal to be 25x larger in 10 years, which implies an aggressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 38% for the next decade. My terminal growth rate of 10% by 2030 is highly conservative, reflecting a scenario where the growth engine is constrained sooner than management expects.
2.  **Faster Margin Expansion:** The market may be anticipating a quicker and higher ramp-up in the Net Income Margin due to the scaling of the high-margin royalty fee business. If the Net Income Margin stabilized at 25% or 30% instead of the projected 20% by 2030, the valuation would increase significantly.
3.  **Lower Discount Rate:** The market may be using a lower WACC/Discount Rate than the conservative 9.0% used here, implying lower perceived business risk. A 7.5% discount rate would materially increase the NPV.
4.  **Lower ROIC Reinvestment/Higher ROIC:** The market might be assuming the company can generate a higher ROIC on retained earnings than the conservative 10.0% used, or that a greater portion of Net Income can be reinvested at high rates.

The **$60.43** valuation represents a price target under a **conservative scenario** where revenue growth slows materially toward the end of the decade and operational leverage (margin expansion) is modest. The market's higher price suggests confidence in Goosehead's ability to execute on its technology-driven, high-margin franchise expansion strategy for a longer duration and with greater success.
