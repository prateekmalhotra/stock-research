### **II. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)**

**Business Engine Justification:**
Vipshop's core business engine is focused on high-margin apparel and its **SVIP loyalty program**. Management commentary across the last four earnings calls consistently highlights that the **double-digit growth of SVIP customers** is the primary driver of high-quality sales and a key strategic priority, achieved through a focus on exclusive off-price products and enhanced merchandising [cite: 1 from step 2, 2 from step 2, 9 from step 2]. The overall e-commerce market in China is facing headwinds and a *cautious consumer spending environment* [cite: 1 from step 2], leading to recent YoY revenue declines (e.g., Q3 2024, Q4 2024, Q2 2025) [cite: 1 from step 2, 11 from step 2, 2 from step 2].

**Revenue Projections (RMB Billion):**

| Year | Revenue Calculation | Revenue (RMB Billions) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | Q1 (26.3) + Q2 (25.8) + Q3 Est (21.2) + Q4 Est (34.0) | **107.3** | Sum of actuals/mid-point guidance for Q1-Q3 2025 and a conservative 2.5% YoY growth on Q4 2024 to estimate Q4 2025. Reflects management's current *stabilization* efforts with a slight decline from FY2024 (RMB 108.4B). [cite: 11 from step 2, 4 from step 2] |
| **2026 (E)** | 107.3 * (1 + 1.5%) | **108.9** | **Conservative Assumption:** Low single-digit growth (1.5%) reflecting modest success in SVIP expansion offsetting macro pressures. |
| **2027 (E)** | 108.9 * (1 + 1.5%) | **110.5** | **Conservative Assumption:** Continued slow growth as market matures. |
| **2028 (E)** | 110.5 * (1 + 1.0%) | **111.6** | **Conservative Assumption:** Further deceleration to 1.0% growth. |
| **2029 (E)** | 111.6 * (1 + 0.5%) | **112.2** | **Conservative Assumption:** Near-stagnant growth reflecting a highly mature market presence. |
| **2030 (E)** | 112.2 * (1 + 0.5%) | **112.8** | **Conservative Assumption:** Near-stagnant growth before terminal value. |

### **III. Net Income and Cash Flow Projections (2025-2030)**

**Margin Justification:**
Management consistently reports **Non-GAAP Net Margin** in the **8.0% to 8.8%** range in recent quarters (Q1/Q2 2025) [cite: 9 from step 2, 4 from step 2]. The management emphasizes maintaining *healthy profitability* and *margin hold up well* despite revenue challenges [cite: 5 from step 2]. To be conservative, I will fix the Net Income Margin (as a proxy for FCF) at the lower end of the recent reported range: **8.0%**.

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Justification:**
Net Income is assumed to go straight into cash for the next year. This cash is then assumed to generate additional income via a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) on the accumulated cash balance. Given the company's large cash pile and profitability, but to remain conservative, a **ROIC of 3.0%** will be used on the prior year's accumulated net income cash.

**Projections Table (RMB Millions):**

| Year | Revenue (RMB MM) | Net Income Margin | Net Income (RMB MM) | Accumulated Net Income (RMB MM) from P-Y | ROIC (3.0%) | Net Income for DCF (RMB MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (E)** | 107,300 | 8.0% | **8,584** | 0 | 0 | **8,584** |
| **2026 (E)** | 108,900 | 8.0% | 8,712 | 8,584 | 258 | **8,970** |
| **2027 (E)** | 110,500 | 8.0% | 8,840 | 17,300 | 519 | **9,359** |
| **2028 (E)** | 111,600 | 8.0% | 8,928 | 26,140 | 784 | **9,712** |
| **2029 (E)** | 112,200 | 8.0% | 8,976 | 35,068 | 1,052 | **10,028** |
| **2030 (E)** | 112,800 | 8.0% | 9,024 | 44,044 | 1,321 | **10,345** |

*Note: Accumulated Net Income (P-Y) for 2026 = 2025 Net Income. For 2027 = 2026 Net Income (original) + 2025 Net Income. Etc.*

### **IV. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**

**Assumptions:**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **10.0%** (Conservative rate reflecting China market, ADR, and e-commerce competitive risk).
*   **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate):** **1.0%** (Very conservative, low-growth perpetuity).

**DCF Table (RMB Millions):**

| Year (t) | Net Income for DCF (RMB MM) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | Present Value (RMB MM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | 8,584 | 0.909 | 7,803 |
| **2026** | 8,970 | 0.826 | 7,407 |
| **2027** | 9,359 | 0.751 | 7,030 |
| **2028** | 9,712 | 0.683 | 6,634 |
| **2029** | 10,028 | 0.621 | 6,228 |
| **2030** | 10,345 | 0.564 | 5,836 |
| **Sum of Projected Cash Flows** | | | **40,938** |

**Terminal Value Calculation (as of 2030):**

$$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{\text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}}$$

$$\text{Terminal Value}_{2030} = \frac{10,345 \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01} = \frac{10,448.45}{0.09} = \text{RMB } 116,093.89 \text{ Million}$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value:**

$$\text{PV of Terminal Value} = \text{Terminal Value}_{2030} \times \text{Discount Factor}_{2030}$$

$$\text{PV of Terminal Value} = 116,093.89 \times 0.564 = \text{RMB } 65,420 \text{ Million}$$

**Net Present Value (NPV) of Future Cash Flows:**

$$\text{NPV} = \text{Sum of Projected PV} + \text{PV of Terminal Value}$$

$$\text{NPV} = 40,938 + 65,420 = \text{RMB } 106,358 \text{ Million}$$

***

### **V. Fair Value Calculation**

**Equity Value (RMB Millions):**

$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{NPV} + \text{Total Cash \& Cash Equivalents} - \text{Total Debt}$$

$$\text{Equity Value} = 106,358 + 27,700 - 6,660 = \text{RMB } 127,398 \text{ Million}$$

**Equity Value (USD Billions):**

$$\text{Equity Value (USD)} = \frac{\text{Equity Value (RMB)}}{\text{Exchange Rate}} = \frac{127,398}{7.167} = \text{US\$ } 17,776.4 \text{ Million}$$

**Fair Value Per ADS:**

$$\text{Fair Value per ADS} = \frac{\text{Equity Value (USD)}}{\text{Total Diluted ADSs Outstanding}}$$

$$\text{Fair Value per ADS} = \frac{17,776,400,000}{511,765,820} = \text{US\$ } 34.74$$

***

### **VI. Conclusion and Justification**

**Fair Value of Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS) Stock:**

$$\text{Fair Value per ADS} = \text{US\$ } 34.74$$

**Comparison to Market Price:**

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Calculated Fair Value** | **US\$ 34.74** |
| **Current Market Price** | **US\$ 17.94** [cite: 2 from step 1] |
| **Difference** | **+93.6%** |

**Justification of Difference:**

The calculated Fair Value of **$34.74** is significantly higher (nearly double) the current market price of **$17.94** [cite: 2 from step 1]. This major discrepancy indicates that the market is making much more pessimistic assumptions about the company's future than the conservative model built from management's stated priorities.

**The Market's Implicit Assumptions (Why the market price is lower):**

1.  **Lower Terminal Growth/Severe Competitive Pressure:** The market is likely pricing in a **Maturity Rate (Terminal Growth Rate) of 0% or even negative**. Given the intensely competitive Chinese e-commerce landscape (with giants like Alibaba and JD.com, and emerging players), the market may believe Vipshop, despite its profitable niche, will inevitably lose market share and see its revenues decline perpetually, making my **1.0%** terminal growth rate seem overly optimistic.
2.  **Greater Discount Rate/Higher Risk:** The market is likely applying a **much higher Discount Rate (WACC)**, perhaps **15% to 20%**, to account for the heightened geopolitical risk associated with Chinese ADRs, regulatory uncertainty in China, and the inherent business risk of competing in a hyper-competitive, low-growth sector. A higher discount rate drastically reduces the Present Value of the terminal value, which is the largest component of a DCF.
3.  **Net Income is Unsustainable/Not True FCF:** The market may not believe the company can sustain an **8.0% Net Income Margin**, anticipating margin compression due to increased marketing spend required to defend market share or a belief that the stated Net Income does not translate into *true* free cash flow to the firm due to unstated capital expenditures or working capital changes.

**Justification for the Calculated Fair Value (Why my assumption is higher):**

1.  **High Cash Pile:** The calculation properly accounts for the significant net cash position (Cash of RMB 27.7B less Debt of RMB 6.66B), which immediately adds substantial value to the equity. The market may be discounting this cash due to uncertainty about its deployment (e.g., risk of value-destroying acquisitions).
2.  **Conservative Profitability:** The **8.0% Net Margin** is based on the company's most recent reported performance and management's own repeated focus on **healthy profitability** [cite: 5 from step 2]. The market's price suggests a Net Margin closer to 4-5% is expected in perpetuity, which contradicts recent results.
3.  **Low-Growth Justification:** The revenue growth model is intentionally **conservative** (starting near-flat and declining to 0.5% growth), yet the profitability of the SVIP segment (the business engine) should allow for modest, high-quality growth, justifying the **1.0% terminal rate**. The market is perhaps overly fixated on top-line revenue deceleration without giving credit to the sustainable profit being generated from the loyal, high-value SVIP segment.

In conclusion, the market is severely penalizing VIPS for its slow top-line growth and country-specific risks, likely assuming a terminal decline in revenue and/or a much higher cost of capital. The DCF suggests that even with a conservative profitability and growth outlook, the company's large cash reserves and steady net income make the stock significantly undervalued.
