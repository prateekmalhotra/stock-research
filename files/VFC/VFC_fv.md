## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (FY2026 - FY2030)

The valuation is built on the foundation of management's "Reinvent" transformation program. The key drivers are:
1.  **Portfolio Streamlining:** VFC is shedding non-core assets (Supreme sale completed; Dickies sale pending for Q3 FY26). This means the revenue base must be adjusted down for a true "continuing operations" forecast.
2.  **Margin Expansion:** Management is targeting **$500 million to $600 million of operating income expansion** by Fiscal Year 2028 (FY28), with the goal of reaching a **10% operating margin** in FY28 *before* any revenue growth is factored in. This margin target is the primary focus of the turnaround.
3.  **Brand Stabilization:** The North Face and Timberland are showing growth, while the turnaround for Vans is underway (declines are moderating).

### Revenue Forecast Justification

*   **Adjusted Base Revenue (FY2026 Start):**
    *   Start with FY2025 Revenue (Continuing Ops): $10,455M.
    *   The Dickies brand (Work segment) revenue must be removed as the sale is pending/guided to be excluded from future P&L. Assuming an approximate $900M revenue for the Work segment (Work segment revenue was $891.5M in FY2024).
    *   **FY2026 Base Revenue (Adjusted):** $10,455M - $900M = **$9,555M**

*   **Conservative Growth Rate:** Given the focus on profitability and the challenging macroeconomic environment for consumer discretionary goods, a *conservative, slow ramp-up* in revenue growth is assumed until the margin goal is met.
    *   **FY2026:** Stabilization year; 0.0% growth.
    *   **FY2027-FY2028:** Very modest growth as the turnaround takes hold; 1.0% CAGR.
    *   **FY2029-FY2030:** Assuming the 10% operating margin is achieved and the business model is proven, an acceleration to a sustainable, low-single-digit growth rate is warranted; 2.0% CAGR.

| Year | FY End | Revenue (Millions USD) | Growth Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | Mar 29, 2025 | $10,455 | - |
| **2026** | Mar 28, 2026 | $9,555 | -8.6% (Adj. for Dickies Sale) |
| **2027** | Mar 27, 2027 | $9,651 | 1.0% |
| **2028** | Mar 31, 2028 | $9,748 | 1.0% |
| **2029** | Mar 30, 2029 | $9,943 | 2.0% |
| **2030** | Mar 29, 2030 | $10,142 | 2.0% |

### Margin and Net Income Projections

The management's 10% Operating Margin target by FY28 is the central profitability metric. Since the company has recently recorded a large net loss, we will use a projected **Net Income Margin** that is conservative relative to the 10% operating margin target.

*   **Operating Margin (OM) Path:** Linear progression from the FY25 Adjusted OM of ~6.0% to the FY28 target of 10.0%.
*   **Operating Income (OI) Calculation:** Revenue x OM.
*   **Interest Expense:** Given the aggressive debt reduction plan (leverage to 2.5x by FY28), a constant, but conservative, high interest expense of **$200M** is used until FY28, and then reduced to **$150M** in FY29-FY30 to reflect debt paydown.
*   **Tax Rate:** A corporate tax rate of **25%** is used.

| Year | Rev. (M USD) | Op. Margin | Op. Income (M USD) | Interest Exp. (M USD) | Pre-Tax Inc. (M USD) | Tax (25%) (M USD) | **Net Income (A)** (M USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | 9,555 | 7.3% | 700 | (200) | 500 | (125) | **375** |
| **2027** | 9,651 | 8.7% | 840 | (200) | 640 | (160) | **480** |
| **2028** | 9,748 | 10.0% | 975 | (200) | 775 | (194) | **581** |
| **2029** | 9,943 | 10.0% | 994 | (150) | 844 | (211) | **633** |
| **2030** | 10,142 | 10.0% | 1,014 | (150) | 864 | (216) | **648** |

## 3. Cash Flow Projections and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

### Reinvested Cash and ROIC Assumption

The valuation assumes that Net Income is a proxy for Free Cash Flow (FCF), as per the required model. The rule mandates a conservative but reasonable positive ROIC on the prior year's Net Income (cash) to generate additional income.

*   **Net Income into Cash:** Net Income from the current year becomes cash for the next year.
*   **ROIC Assumption:** A conservative **5.0%** Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is applied to the prior year's accumulated cash (Net Income from prior years). This is a prudent assumption for a turnaround company in an established industry.

| Year | Net Income (A) (M USD) | Cash from Previous Year (M USD) | ROIC (5.0%) on Cash (M USD) | **Total FCF (B)** (M USD) | Discount Factor (10.0%) | **NPV (M USD)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | 375 | 0 | 0 | **375** | 0.9091 | 340.91 |
| **2027** | 480 | 375 | 19 | **499** | 0.8264 | 412.33 |
| **2028** | 581 | 874 | 44 | **625** | 0.7513 | 469.56 |
| **2029** | 633 | 1,499 | 75 | **708** | 0.6830 | 483.68 |
| **2030** | 648 | 2,207 | 110 | **758** | 0.6209 | 470.67 |
| **Sum of NPV (2026 - 2030)** | | | | | | **2,177.15** |

Note: Total FCF (B) = Net Income (A) + ROIC on Cash. Cash from Previous Year is the accumulated FCF from all prior projected years.

### Discount Rate and Terminal Value

*   **Discount Rate (Conservative but Reasonable):** **10.0%**. This is a reasonable discount rate for a turnaround company with execution risk, reflecting a higher cost of capital than a fully stable industry leader.
*   **Maturity Rate (Conservative):** **1.5%**. A very conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting a stable apparel/lifestyle market, below long-term GDP growth.

**Terminal Value Calculation (2030 FCF):**
*   Terminal Value = [FCF (2030) * (1 + Maturity Rate)] / (Discount Rate - Maturity Rate)
*   Terminal Value = [$758 * (1 + 0.015)] / (0.10 - 0.015)
*   Terminal Value = $769.37 / 0.085 = $9,051.41 Million

**Terminal Value Net Present Value (NPV):**
*   Terminal NPV = Terminal Value * Discount Factor (2030)
*   Terminal NPV = $9,051.41 * 0.6209 = **$5,620.48 Million**

---

## 4. Fair Value Calculation

**Total Equity Value (Fair Value of the Firm):**
*   NPV of Projected FCF (2026-2030): $2,177.15 Million
*   NPV of Terminal Value: $5,620.48 Million
*   **Total Enterprise Value (TEV):** $7,797.63 Million

**Fair Value of Equity:**
*   TEV + Current Cash - Total Debt
*   $7,797.63 Million + $429.38 Million - $5,670.00 Million = **$2,557.01 Million**

**Fair Value Per Share:**
*   Fair Value of Equity / Shares Outstanding
*   $2,557.01 Million / 394.00 Million shares = **$6.49 per share**

## 5. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value of V.F. Corporation Stock: $6.49 per share**

### Justification of Discrepancy with Market Value

The calculated Fair Value of **$6.49** is significantly lower than the market price (approximately $14.04). This implies the market's current assumptions about VFC's turnaround are much more aggressive than this conservative DCF model.

**Market's Implicit Assumptions (Why the Market is Higher):**
1.  **More Aggressive Revenue Growth:** The market likely expects VFC to stabilize the Vans brand and achieve high-single-digit to low-double-digit annual revenue growth in the medium-term, not the low-single-digit growth (1.0%-2.0%) projected here. A growth rate of just **3.5%** in the terminal period would increase the Fair Value to the market price.
2.  **Higher Terminal Margin/Value:** The market may believe the 10% Operating Margin target is a *floor*, not a ceiling, and that the company can return to historical pre-crisis margins (Operating Margin of 15%+ for its strongest brands), leading to a much higher Terminal Value.
3.  **Faster Debt Reduction/Lower Cost of Capital:** The market may be factoring in the sale of Dickies ($600M expected) and another potential asset sale, which would accelerate debt paydown, drastically reduce interest expense, and lower the required Discount Rate (reducing the cost of capital).
4.  **Lower Discount Rate:** A 9.0% Discount Rate (instead of 10.0%) would imply a lower risk profile and a higher valuation.

**Model's Conservative Assumption (Why the Valuation is Lower):**
1.  **Focus on Management Floor:** The model took management's stated "10% operating margin by FY28" as the successful completion of the turnaround, applying it as the long-term margin. In reality, sustained success could push this higher, but the conservative model holds the line.
2.  **High Execution Risk:** The 10.0% Discount Rate is justified by the significant execution risk of the "Reinvent" program, the need to stabilize the core Vans brand, and the high leverage profile that must be de-risked.
3.  **Limited ROIC:** The 5.0% ROIC on re-invested cash is a conservative way to account for re-investment when historical ROIC is negative, which limits the acceleration of future cash flows.

**Conclusion:** The market is valuing VFC as a *successful* turnaround that rapidly exceeds the internal 10% operating margin target and achieves solid mid-single-digit revenue growth. This conservative valuation implies a **53.8% downside** risk if VFC fails to meet, or only meets, its minimum stated operational targets without substantial revenue recovery.
