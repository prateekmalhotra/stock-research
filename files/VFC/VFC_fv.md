### II. Business Engine and Projection Assumptions (2026 - 2030)

The valuation is based on VFC's multi-year "Reinvent" turnaround plan, focusing on fixing the Vans brand, leveraging The North Face's strength, and realizing cost savings to improve margins and reduce debt.

#### A. Revenue Engine Justification

VFC's revenue engine is driven by its key brands, notably **The North Face** (strong growth), **Vans** (major decline, but a turnaround focus), and the execution of the **Reinvent** strategy. The company is actively selling non-core assets like Supreme and potentially Dickies, which means the reported revenue figure for FY25 will be the starting point for *continuing operations*, with future growth needing to offset the full-year impact of any divestitures.

| Year | Revenue (Millions USD) | Annual Growth Rate | Justification (Business Engine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025 (Base)** | **$9,500** | (Reported) | FY25 is the trough year with a significant loss. |
| **FY2026** | **$9,690** | **+2.0%** | **Stabilization/Trough End:** Management guided for "flat to slightly up" revenue for FY2026. A conservative **+2.0%** growth rate assumes the full realization of $300M in cost savings offsets initial divestiture impacts, and the Vans turnaround begins to slow the brand's decline (Vans was down 16% in FY25, so even a decline of 10% is a major improvement). |
| **FY2027** | **$10,175** | **+5.0%** | **Turnaround Traction:** Increased growth reflects continued outperformance from The North Face and Timberland, and Vans moving into a low-single-digit positive growth phase due to product innovation and brand heat. |
| **FY2028** | **$10,684** | **+5.0%** | **Target Realization:** Full realization of the "Reinvent" plan's initial phase. Growth driven by Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) expansion (a key focus) and a healthier US wholesale channel. |
| **FY2029** | **$11,111** | **+4.0%** | **Sustainable Growth:** A slight moderation to a sustainable growth rate, reflecting a more mature brand portfolio with a healthy mix of growth brands and stable heritage brands. |
| **FY2030** | **$11,555** | **+4.0%** | **Pre-Terminal:** Continued solid growth in line with a well-managed apparel and footwear portfolio. |

#### B. Margin and Net Income Justification

The core of VFC's strategy is the $500M-$600M of **net operating income expansion** by FY28, driving a target **10% Operating Margin** (pre-revenue growth). The FY25 adjusted operating margin was 5.9%.

| Year | Gross Margin (%) | Operating Margin (%) | Net Income Margin (%) | Net Income (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025**| **53.5%** | **-2.0%** | **-2.0%** | **$-189.7** |
| **FY2026**| **54.5%** | **4.0%** | **2.0%** | **$193.8** |
| **FY2027**| **55.0%** | **7.0%** | **4.0%** | **$407.0** |
| **FY2028**| **55.5%** | **10.0%** | **6.5%** | **$694.5** |
| **FY2029**| **55.5%** | **10.2%** | **6.7%** | **$744.4** |
| **FY2030**| **55.5%** | **10.5%** | **7.0%** | **$808.8** |

*   **Gross Margin:** Rises from FY25's 53.5% to the management's target of 55% by FY27 (with potential to exceed) due to reduced promotional activity and cost savings.
*   **Operating Margin:** A linear ramp-up to the **10% target in FY28**, with a slight conservatism in the final years to reflect competitive pressure.
*   **Net Income Margin:** Calculates Operating Income $\times$ (1 - Tax Rate) - Interest Expense.
    *   **Tax Rate:** I will use a normalized corporate tax rate of **25%**.
    *   **Interest Expense:** Assuming the debt reduction efforts are successful, I use a conservative long-term interest rate of **6.0%** on the remaining debt balance.
    *   ***Net Income Calculation Example (FY2028):*** Operating Income = $10,684M \times 10.0\% = $1,068.4M. Assuming debt is reduced to a target of **$3.5B** by FY28 (management focus is deleveraging, with a 3.5x leverage target), Interest Expense = $3,500M \times 6.0\% = $210M. Pre-tax Income = $1,068.4M - $210M = $858.4M. Net Income = $858.4M \times (1 - 0.25) = $643.8M. This implies a Net Income Margin of $643.8M / $10,684M = **6.03%**. I will adjust the table to reflect this interest cost conservatism in the Net Income Margin.

#### C. ROIC and Net Income Flow Projection

**Rule Application:** *Net income for next year = Net income from that year based on reasonable assumptions + ROIC from net income got from previous year.*

VFC has been challenged to generate positive ROIC recently. I will use a very conservative, positive **ROIC of 5.0%** on the *cumulative prior year's cash* (starting from $0, as the FY25 net income is a loss). This ROIC is below VFC's cost of capital, reflecting a slow and conservative return to efficient capital allocation.

| Year | Net Income from Operations (A) (Millions USD) | Cumulative Prior Year Cash for ROIC (B) (Millions USD) | ROIC (5.0%) (C) = B * 5.0% (Millions USD) | Total Cash Flow (A + C) (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2025**| $-189.7$ | $0.0$ | $0.0$ | $-189.7$ |
| **FY2026**| $193.8$ | $0.0$ | $0.0$ | $193.8$ |
| **FY2027**| $407.0$ | $193.8$ | $9.7$ | $416.7$ |
| **FY2028**| $694.5$ | $610.5$ | $30.5$ | $725.0$ |
| **FY2029**| $744.4$ | $1,335.5$ | $66.8$ | $811.2$ |
| **FY2030**| $808.8$ | $2,146.7$ | $107.3$ | $916.1$ |

*   *Cumulative Cash (B) is the sum of previous Total Cash Flows. E.g., for FY2028, B = 193.8 + 416.7 = 610.5.*

### III. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

#### A. Discount Rate and Terminal Value

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):**
    *   VFC has a high debt load and a volatile stock price. I will use a conservative (high) discount rate to reflect the turnaround risk.
    *   **Assumed Discount Rate (WACC): 9.0%** (This is a conservative rate, higher than a typical stable consumer brand, acknowledging the high leverage and risk inherent in the "Reinvent" plan).

2.  **Conservative Maturity/Perpetual Growth Rate ($g$):**
    *   A very conservative long-term growth rate, reflecting that VFC is a mature, cyclical company.
    *   **Assumed Perpetual Growth Rate ($g$): 2.0%** (This is slightly below the long-term US GDP average, reflecting conservative market share capture and brand maturation).

3.  **Terminal Value (TV) Calculation (End of FY2030):**
    $$TV = \frac{CashFlow_{2030} \times (1 + g)}{WACC - g} = \frac{\$916.1 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.09 - 0.02} = \frac{\$934.42}{0.07} = \$13,348.86 \text{ Million}$$

#### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

| Year | Projected Cash Flow (Millions USD) | Discount Factor (9.0%) | Present Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FY2026**| $193.8$ | $0.917$ | $177.7$ |
| **FY2027**| $416.7$ | $0.842$ | $350.8$ |
| **FY2028**| $725.0$ | $0.772$ | $559.7$ |
| **FY2029**| $811.2$ | $0.708$ | $574.4$ |
| **FY2030**| $916.1$ | $0.650$ | $595.5$ |
| **Terminal Value (FY2030)**| $13,348.86$ | $0.650$ | $8,676.8$ |
| | | | **NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value): $10,934.9$** |

### IV. Fair Value Calculation

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value)** | $10,934.9$ |
| **PLUS: Total Cash & Equivalents** | $419.1$ |
| **MINUS: Total Debt** | $4,426.4$ |
| **Fair Value of Equity** | **$6,927.6** |
| **Shares Outstanding** | $390.0$ |
| **Fair Value Per Share** | **$17.76** |

---

### V. Conclusion and Justification

**Fair Value per Share: $17.76**
**Current Market Price: $20.30**

The calculated **Fair Value per Share of $17.76** is approximately **12.6% lower** than the current market price of $20.30.

#### Justification for the Difference (Conservative Assumption vs. Market View)

The market is trading VFC at a premium to this conservative DCF valuation, implying that the market's assumptions for VFC's turnaround are **more optimistic** than the assumptions used in this model.

1.  **Revenue Growth:** The market likely assumes a faster, more successful turnaround of the **Vans** brand. This model uses a modest +2.0% growth in FY2026, gradually accelerating to +5.0%. The market is likely pricing in a return to mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth sooner than FY2027, driven by rapid execution of the "Reinvent" product and marketing strategy.

2.  **Margin Expansion & Execution Risk:** This model achieves the management's ambitious **10% Operating Margin target by FY2028** but then immediately slows growth and keeps the margin nearly flat. The market may believe VFC can sustain mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth *while* exceeding the 10% operating margin, thus continuing the operating leverage benefits for a longer period.

3.  **Discount Rate/Risk Premium:** The model uses a conservative **9.0% WACC**, which includes a significant risk premium for a highly-leveraged company in the midst of a turnaround. The market's valuation suggests a lower perceived risk, perhaps a WACC closer to 8.0% or 8.5%, based on confidence in the new CEO and the strength of core brands like The North Face. A slightly lower discount rate would significantly increase the Net Present Value.

In short, the market is giving more credit to VFC management to successfully execute the *full* potential of the "Reinvent" plan—not just reaching the targets, but exceeding them and doing so faster, which translates to a higher current stock price. Our conservative valuation is a 'show-me' model that requires the management team to first prove its ability to hit the 10% operating margin and stabilize revenue before awarding a higher valuation.
