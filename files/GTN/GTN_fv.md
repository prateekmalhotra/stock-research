## 2. Business Engine & Revenue Forecast (2025 - 2030)

Gray Television's business engine is driven by four primary components: **Political Advertising**, **Core Advertising**, **Retransmission Consent Revenue**, and **Digital Revenue**. The core thesis is that the company operates on a predictable two-year political cycle (Presidential/Midterm) with an underlying secular decline in legacy revenue offset by growth in digital.

**Business Engine Assumptions (Conservative Estimates):**

| Revenue Component | 2025-2030 Driver & Justification | Assumption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Political Advertising** | Highly cyclical. The years 2026, 2028, and 2030 are major election years. 2024 political ad revenue was ~$500M. 2022 Midterm was ~$455M. Non-election year 2023 was only $79M. I will conservatively project a modest 3% growth for each election cycle. | **Election Year (2026, 2028, 2030):** \$515M, \$530M, \$546M. **Non-Election Year (2025, 2027, 2029):** \$85M, \$90M, \$95M. |
| **Core Advertising** | Secular decline due to cord-cutting and shift to digital, evidenced by a 3% decline in Q2 2025. Management projects a low to mid-single digit decline for Q3 2025. | **Secular Decline:** **-3.5%** YoY. |
| **Retransmission Consent Revenue** | A structural headwind due to subscriber losses (cord-cutting), evidenced by a 1% decline in Q2 2025. The company faces ongoing negotiation pressures. | **Secular Decline:** **-2.0%** YoY. |
| **Digital/Other Revenue** | The primary growth engine. Digital revenue grew 8% in Q2 2025 and is projected to grow in the low double-digits by management in Q3 2025. | **Conservative Growth:** **+8.0%** YoY (using the lower end of management's Q2 performance). |
| **Base Revenue (2024 Est.)** | Based on the 2024 full-year revenue of ~$3.64B, broken down by its components (approximations based on known Q2 data and historical trends for modeling consistency). | **2024 Base Revenue Breakdown (Historical):** Core Ad (\$1,450M), Retransmission (\$1,480M), Digital/Other (\$210M), Political (\$500M). **Total Revenue 2024: \$3,640M** |

### Projected Revenue (In Millions of USD)

| Year | Core Advertising (Growth Rate) | Retransmission (Growth Rate) | Digital/Other (Growth Rate) | Political Ad Revenue | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 (Base)** | \$1,450 | \$1,480 | \$210 | \$500 | **\$3,640** |
| **2025 (Non-Elec)** | \$1,400 (-3.5%) | \$1,450 (-2.0%) | \$227 (+8.0%) | \$85 | **\$3,162** |
| **2026 (Mid-term Elec)** | \$1,351 (-3.5%) | \$1,421 (-2.0%) | \$245 (+8.0%) | \$515 | **\$3,532** |
| **2027 (Non-Elec)** | \$1,304 (-3.5%) | \$1,393 (-2.0%) | \$264 (+8.0%) | \$90 | **\$3,051** |
| **2028 (Pres. Elec)** | \$1,259 (-3.5%) | \$1,365 (-2.0%) | \$285 (+8.0%) | \$530 | **\$3,439** |
| **2029 (Non-Elec)** | \$1,215 (-3.5%) | \$1,338 (-2.0%) | \$307 (+8.0%) | \$95 | **\$2,955** |
| **2030 (Mid-term Elec)** | \$1,172 (-3.5%) | \$1,311 (-2.0%) | \$332 (+8.0%) | \$546 | **\$3,361** |

## 3. Margin & Net Income Projection

### A. Margin & ROIC Assumptions

The net income is highly distorted by depreciation/amortization (D&A), impairment charges, and high interest expense from the debt. The instruction uses Net Income as the cash flow proxy, which requires a conservative but positive margin projection.

*   **Net Income Margin:** I will use the average historical Net Income Margin from the previous full political cycle (2023-2024) and apply a conservative 30% reduction to reflect the structural headwinds in Retransmission/Core Advertising and high interest expense. The average net income for 2023 was a loss, and 2024 was profitable due to political ads. Given the management focus on cost control (flat operating expenses in Q2 2025), a positive, albeit very low, margin is reasonable to project for a cyclical company during the up-cycle.
    *   **Net Income Margin Assumption:** **3.0%** of Total Revenue (a conservative assumption acknowledging the drag of debt interest expense and D&A).
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The company has been focused on debt reduction (paying down $22M in Q2 2025). I will use a conservative but positive reinvestment rate to avoid projecting unrealistic exponential growth from a volatile/unpredictable historical ROIC.
    *   **Conservative ROIC Assumption:** **2.0%** (Applied to the prior year's accumulated "cash" / net income).

### B. Projected Net Income & Free Cash Flow (In Millions of USD)

The projected Net Income for each year is calculated as:
$Net\ Income_n = (Total\ Revenue_n \times 3.0\%) + (Accumulated\ Net\ Income_{n-1} \times 2.0\%)$

| Year | Total Revenue | Net Income (3.0% Margin) | Accumulated Net Income (Previous Year) | ROIC Income (2.0%) | **Projected Net Income** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$3,162 | \$95 | \$0 | \$0 | **\$95** |
| **2026** | \$3,532 | \$106 | \$95 | \$2 | **\$108** |
| **2027** | \$3,051 | \$92 | \$203 (95+108) | \$4 | **\$96** |
| **2028** | \$3,439 | \$103 | \$299 (203+96) | \$6 | **\$109** |
| **2029** | \$2,955 | \$89 | \$408 (299+109) | \$8 | **\$97** |
| **2030** | \$3,361 | \$101 | \$505 (408+97) | \$10 | **\$111** |

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

### A. Rate Assumptions

*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** Given the high debt level (\$5.65B) and the volatile nature of earnings, a conservative yet reasonable high-teens WACC is appropriate.
    *   **Discount Rate Assumption:** **10.0%** (Conservative, below the company's estimated cost of equity but above the long-term historical market return).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (Maturity Rate):** A conservative rate must be used to model growth beyond 2030. Given the structural decline in core business offset by digital growth, the terminal rate should be low.
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate Assumption:** **1.0%** (A very conservative growth rate, just above a flat line, acknowledging long-term industry headwinds).

### B. Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The **Terminal Value (TV)** is calculated at the end of 2030 using the Gordon Growth Model:
$$TV_{2030} = \frac{Net\ Income_{2030} \times (1 + \text{Maturity Rate})}{ \text{Discount Rate} - \text{Maturity Rate}} = \frac{\$111 \times 1.01}{0.10 - 0.01} = \$1,249.22\ \text{million}$$

The **Net Present Value (NPV)** of all future cash flows (Net Income + Terminal Value) is calculated as:

| Year (n) | Cash Flow (Net Income) | Discount Factor (1 / (1 + 0.10)^n) | Present Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | \$95 | 0.9091 | \$86.36 |
| **2026** | \$108 | 0.8264 | \$89.25 |
| **2027** | \$96 | 0.7513 | \$72.12 |
| **2028** | \$109 | 0.6830 | \$74.45 |
| **2029** | \$97 | 0.6209 | \$60.13 |
| **2030 (CF + TV)** | \$111 + \$1,249.22 = \$1,360.22 | 0.5645 | \$767.89 |
| **Total Net Present Value (NPV)** | | | **\$1,150.20 million** |

## 5. Fair Value Calculation and Justification

### A. Fair Value of Equity

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated by taking the NPV of future cash flows, adding the current cash balance, and subtracting the total debt.

$$Fair\ Value\ of\ Equity = \text{NPV} + \text{Cash} - \text{Debt}$$
$$Fair\ Value\ of\ Equity = \$1,150.20M + \$199M - \$5,651M = \mathbf{-\$4,301.80\ million}$$

### B. Fair Value Per Share

$$Fair\ Value\ Per\ Share = \frac{\text{Fair\ Value\ of\ Equity}}{\text{Shares\ Outstanding}} = \frac{-\$4,301.80M}{92.50\ million} = \mathbf{-\$46.51}$$

### C. Current Stock Price

The current market price for GTN stock is necessary for comparison.
I will perform the final search to get the current price.### D. Final Conclusion and Justification

The current market price is approximately **\$4.60 per share**.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Current Market Price (GTN)** | **\$4.60** |
| **Calculated Fair Value Per Share** | **-\$46.51** |

## Conclusion and Justification of Discrepancy

My conservative DCF valuation, which relies on management's stated business trends and historical data, concludes that Gray Television's equity value is **negative \$4.3 billion**, leading to a Fair Value Per Share of **-\$46.51**. This is vastly different from the current market price of **\$4.60** per share.

The core reason for this massive discrepancy is the **company's immense debt load** relative to its future discounted cash flow.

| Factor | Calculation Insight | Discrepancy Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Debt** | \$5.65 Billion | The net present value of all cash flows until 2030, including a conservative terminal value, is only **\$1.15 Billion**. Even with a highly optimistic DCF model, the cash flow generated cannot cover the existing debt. |
| **Cash Flow Model** | Net Income Margin: 3.0% | The business is an excellent cash flow generator (OCF was \$648M - \$829M in the 2022-2024 period), but this cash flow is immediately consumed by high capital expenditures and, most importantly, **interest payments**. |
| **Interest Expense** | Not explicitly calculated, but implied by low Net Income. | The company's interest expense for 2025 was projected to be around **\$460 million**. An average net income of \$100M per year (my projection) means that the interest alone eats up over 80% of operating profit. |

### The Market's Assumptions

The market's price of **\$4.60** per share implies that investors are making one or more of the following key assumptions that are significantly more optimistic than my conservative DCF model:

1.  **Massive Political Advertising Growth:** The market assumes that the political cycles of 2026, 2028, and 2030 will not just grow modestly but will deliver **significantly higher** political ad revenue than my conservative projections, potentially in the range of **\$600M - \$700M+** per cycle. This is plausible given the increasing polarization and spending in US politics.
2.  **Successful Deleveraging / Restructuring:** The market is pricing in the high probability that the company will successfully use its massive operating cash flow (OCF) from election years (2026, 2028, 2030) to pay down a **large portion of its debt principal**. If Gray could reduce its total debt by even **\$2.0 billion** in the next few years, the valuation would move from a deeply negative to a positive value.
3.  **Retransmission Stability and Digital Acceleration:** The market expects the company's retransmission revenue decline to be temporary, or for the new digital revenue stream (e.g., ATSC 3.0/NextGen TV deployment) to accelerate far faster than the 8.0% I projected, fundamentally changing the secular trend of the business engine.
4.  **Equity Value is a Call Option on the Political Cycle:** The market is viewing the equity as a highly levered bet on the next few political cycles. A political windfall of cash flow funneled directly to debt reduction could cause the equity value to soar from its current low base.

The most critical difference is the treatment of **debt**. My DCF model indicates that **the high debt makes the common equity virtually worthless** unless the company can consistently generate operating cash flow well above its debt service and maintenance capital expenditure requirements, or successfully executes a massive deleveraging program. The market, however, believes this deleveraging is highly probable due to the cyclical cash flow generated by political spending.
