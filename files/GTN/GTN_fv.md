## 2. Business Engine and Revenue Projections (2025-2030)

Gray Media Group's business engine is dominated by two main factors:
1.  **The Political Advertising Cycle:** This creates a significant revenue swing between even-numbered years (major elections: 2026, 2028, 2030) and odd-numbered years (off-cycle: 2025, 2027, 2029).
2.  **Base Business (Core Advertising and Retransmission Consent):** Core advertising is weak (management noted a low-to-mid single-digit decline in Q3 2025), and Retransmission Consent Revenue declined by 6% in Q3 2025.

**Engine Assumptions:**

| Revenue Component | 2025-2030 Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secular Trend (Core/Retransmission/Digital)** | **-1.0% CAGR** | Highly conservative. While digital is growing, core and retrans are declining. This assumes secular declines in traditional TV outweigh digital gains. |
| **Political Revenue (Base)** | **$500M** (High Cycle), **$50M** (Low Cycle) | FY 2024 political was substantial (difference between 2024's $3.6B and a normalized base). We conservatively assume $500M for high-cycle years (2026, 2028, 2030) and a minimal $50M for off-cycle years (2025, 2027, 2029), reflecting Q3 2025's $8M political exceeding expectations. |
| **Starting Base Revenue (2024 Adjusted)** | **$3,100M** | $3,600M (FY 2024 Revenue) - $500M (Conservative political estimate for 2024) = $3,100M. |

### Projected Revenue (In Millions USD)

| Year | Starting Base Revenue | Secular Trend (-1.0%) | Base Revenue | Political Revenue | **Total Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025 (Low Cycle)** | $3,100 | $3,069 | $3,069 | $50 | **$3,119** |
| **2026 (High Cycle)** | $3,069 | $3,038 | $3,038 | $500 | **$3,538** |
| **2027 (Low Cycle)** | $3,038 | $3,008 | $3,008 | $50 | **$3,058** |
| **2028 (High Cycle)** | $3,008 | $2,978 | $2,978 | $500 | **$3,478** |
| **2029 (Low Cycle)** | $2,978 | $2,948 | $2,948 | $50 | **$2,998** |
| **2030 (High Cycle)** | $2,948 | $2,918 | $2,918 | $500 | **$3,418** |

## 3. Margin and Net Income Projections

Net Income is the primary cash flow metric for this valuation. The company faces high interest expenses due to its significant debt load ($5.61B), which causes high volatility in Net Income (FY 2024 Net Margin was 10.3%, while Q3 2025 was a net loss).

**Margin and ROIC Assumptions:**

| Metric | Assumption | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Net Income Margin (High Cycle - Even Years)** | **7.0%** | Conservative discount from FY 2024's 10.3% to reflect current cost pressures and high interest expense. |
| **Net Income Margin (Low Cycle - Odd Years)** | **3.5%** | This is a positive, but very conservative margin to account for low political revenue and sustained high interest expense, moving back from recent quarterly losses. |
| **ROIC % on Previous Year's Cash** | **3.0%** | Highly conservative. Lower than the historical 5.49% TTM ROIC, reflecting the company's focus on deleveraging rather than large new investments. |
| **Tax Rate (Effective)** | **25%** | A long-term corporate tax rate assumption, acknowledging the company's variable tax profile and the complex nature of its tax deferrals from high debt. |

### Projected Net Income / Discounted Cash Flow (In Millions USD)

| Year | Total Revenue (A) | Net Income Margin | Operating Net Income (B) = A * Margin | Prior Year's Cash (C) | ROIC Income (D) = C * 3.0% | **Total Net Income (E) = B + D** | **NPV (Discounted Cash Flow)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | $3,119 | 3.5% | $109 | $182 | $5 | **$114** | $104 |
| **2026** | $3,538 | 7.0% | $248 | $296 | $9 | **$257** | $213 |
| **2027** | $3,058 | 3.5% | $107 | $552 | $17 | **$124** | $93 |
| **2028** | $3,478 | 7.0% | $243 | $676 | $20 | **$264** | $179 |
| **2029** | $2,998 | 3.5% | $105 | $940 | $28 | **$133** | $79 |
| **2030** | $3,418 | 7.0% | $239 | $1,073 | $32 | **$271** | $146 |
| **Terminal Value** | - | - | - | - | - | - | $1,228 |
| **Total NPV of Cash Flows** | | | | | | | **$2,042** |

*   **Prior Year's Cash (2025)**: $182M (Initial Cash) + $375M (FY 2024 Net Income) = $557M (Used $182M for the 2025 calc to be conservative with initial cash and exclude non-recurring net income). *Using $182M (Initial Cash) + $109M (2025 NI) = $291M as cash for 2026. The table shows the cumulative cash build-up which becomes the base for ROIC in the following year.*

## 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation

### DCF Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discount Rate (r)** | **10.0%** | A reasonable and conservative rate for a highly-leveraged, cyclical media company in a secularly declining industry (broadcasting). |
| **Conservative Maturity Rate (g)** | **1.0%** | Assumes the company's cash flow growth matures to a very low rate, reflecting its debt reduction focus and the long-term challenges of the broadcasting industry. |

### Terminal Value Calculation (2030)

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_{2030} \times (1 + \text{g})}{\text{r} - \text{g}}
$$

$$
\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{\$271 \text{ million} \times (1 + 0.01)}{0.10 - 0.01} = \$3,037 \text{ million}
$$

### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation

The NPV of all projected cash flows (including the Terminal Value) discounted back to 2024:

$$
\text{NPV of Future Cash Flows} = \sum_{t=1}^{2030} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of Cash Flows (2025-2030)} = \$104 + \$213 + \$93 + \$179 + \$79 + \$146 = \$814 \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{NPV of Terminal Value} = \frac{\$3,037 \text{ million}}{(1 + 0.10)^6} = \$1,714 \text{ million}
$$

$$
\text{Total NPV of Future Cash Flows} = \$814 \text{ million} + \$1,714 \text{ million} = **\$2,528 \text{ million}**
$$

*Correction: The table's NPV sum ($\$2,042$M) was incorrect due to a manual calculation error, the correct sum is **$\$2,528 \text{ million}$**.*

## 5. Fair Value Calculation

The Fair Value of Equity is calculated as the Net Present Value of Future Cash Flows (Enterprise Value) minus Total Debt, plus Total Cash & Cash Equivalents.

| Component | Value (in Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total NPV of Future Cash Flows** | $2,528 |
| **\+ Total Cash & Cash Equivalents** | $182 |
| **\- Total Debt** | $5,610 |
| **Fair Value of Equity (Numerator)** | **$(\$2,899 \text{ million})$** |
| **Divided by Shares Outstanding (in millions)** | $102.09 |
| **Fair Value per Share** | **$(\$28.40)$** |

### **Fair Value of GTN Stock: $(\$28.40)$**

---

## 6. Justification and Market Interpretation

The calculated fair value of $(\$28.40)$ per share indicates that, based on a conservative DCF model focused on Net Income and a major negative Net Equity calculation, **the company's debt load is far too high for the generated cash flows to support its valuation.**

**Comparison to Market Value:**
*   **Calculated Fair Value:** Negative (\$28.40)
*   **Current Stock Price:** \$4.64

**Justification for Disparity (Why the Market is Different):**

The market is making a significant assumption that is not fully accounted for in this conservative Net Income DCF model: **The Market is valuing the company on an Enterprise Value (EV) basis using a metric like Adjusted EBITDA, with the expectation that the high debt will be successfully managed and reduced with political cash flows.**

1.  **Market Focus on Adjusted EBITDA / FCF (Free Cash Flow):** Gray Media is a capital-intensive business with very high non-cash charges like Depreciation & Amortization (D&A). EBITDA and Free Cash Flow (FCF) are typically much higher than Net Income. The market is valuing the *operating business*, not the *reported net profitability* after massive interest payments. The company generated $608 million in FCF in FY 2024.
2.  **Successful Deleveraging Expectation:** Management explicitly stated their strategy is to utilize cash flow from the 2026 and 2028 political cycles to reduce debt. The market is pricing in the *success* of this strategy, believing that the debt will be reduced enough to lower interest expense significantly, which would then dramatically increase the Net Income in later years. If the company reduces debt by $1.5B (using high cycle cash flows), its interest expense would drop, and the Net Income would become sustainably positive, pushing the DCF to a positive value.
3.  **Asset Value (Hidden Moat):** The local broadcasting license portfolio and real estate (e.g., Assembly Atlanta studio facilities) are high-value, hard-to-replicate assets. The stock price of $4.64 may represent a belief that the underlying asset value (including goodwill/intangibles) is salvageable even if the debt remains high.

**Conclusion:**

The extreme disparity is due to the fundamental difference in valuation methodologies. My conservative, Net-Income-based DCF demonstrates that **the current cash flow stream is insufficient to cover the crushing debt load, resulting in a negative equity valuation.** The market, conversely, is relying on **Adjusted EBITDA** (or a similar cash-flow-proxy metric) and the belief that the company will successfully execute its **deleveraging plan** in the upcoming political cycles, which would fundamentally change the Net Income projection for years 2028-2030 and beyond. An EV/EBITDA multiple approach would yield a positive valuation, reflecting the market's faith in the operational cash flow's ability to service and eventually reduce the debt.
